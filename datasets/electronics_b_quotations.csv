A001944026UMZ8T3K5QH1,0,Not the right one,1,0,17
A01852072Z7B68UHLI5UG,0,I bought this for a gift.  The recipient loved it.  It was utilitarian.  No problems noted.They really. really enjoy using it.,4,1,126
A030530627MK66BD8V4LN,0,My boyfriend and I spent hours looking for the one I wanted. We came across this one and it was cheap!  After reading lots of reviews I didnt expect much from it. but it is perfect. Its holding my 32 inch Vizio  tv in my bedroom perfectly. My boyfriend did tighten lots of different bolts on it after it was up so it would be completely level. I think the people that say it sags didnt do this. He did use his own level and not the one it came with. I helped him when he did this. I held the tv in the position that made it level and he tightened lots of stuff until it held it there. I have had it up for a couple months with no problem. I love it. Perfect for the price. The hardest part was finding the stud. My apt complex had them every 22 inches on the wall I wanted it on.,4,1,779
A0641581307AKT5MAOU0Q,0,The charger was bought to support the  Universal Home Charger  which is not universal.  With the adapter it is now universal but it would not have been a necessary purchase if the  Home Charger  had come as advertised.,4,1,218
A076219533YHEV2LJO988,66,the nook is very good it just did not come with the charger cord and i was not informed about that.,3,0,99
A100IGCRWUYAZW,2324,I bought this camera to take on my trip to Europe.  It easily fits in a waistpouch and is very lightweight.  The ability to take 3 different size photos was a real convenience.  With the Panoramic size option I was able  to take a great photo of the Eiffel Tower  top to bottom!  The only thing  I dont like about this camera is that the 3volt battery must be changed  after about 12 rolls of film .Advantix 25 exposure. have been used.  The  batteries are expensive and its a real pain to have it die while on an  excursion.  The film will automatically rewind when the battery is low or  dead.  The zoom lens is wonderful!  This camera is well worth the cost for  anyone who wants a point and shoot camera with all the features of a larger  35mm.,5,1,748
A101DJDPGK0Q46,22,There are so many people who go on about disliking ereaders. because you cant holdsmell the actual book. I was one of these people. too. However. when I went to Barnes u0026 Noble to get my hands on a Nook. I instantly fell in love. I love books more than the average person. and the Nook. in my opinion. is 10 times better than an actual book. It is so simple to lay on the couch. bed. or in the park and read from the device. It doesnt have LED backlighting so the screen wont annoy your eyesight. I sometimes catch myself accidentally trying to manually turn the page due to forgetting that it isnt a physical book! Honestly. this is one purchase I am completely happy about. It is so easy to purchase the next book in a series on the Nook. too. Sometimes people get a little confused about how to handle the device. The battery will drop dismally if you completely shut down and turn back on the device a lot. The best thing to do is to put it in sleep mode even if you arent going to read from it for a day or two. I can get up to 10 days battery life on mine during avid reading. Also. navigating on the ereader could be troublesome at first if you are use to an all screen touch like me. but the designers definitely knew what they were doing with the design. and after learning how to go about finding my way around through the touch panel at the bottom of the nook. I think it is absolutely perfect!,5,1,1408
A101IWCCIWQWC9,46,Its entirely possible that its just a coincidence. but my DVD player stopped working entirely after I tried to use this cleaner.  It would not recognize the cleaning disc. and now it wont recognize anything else either.  The directions are pretty straightforward. so I dont think I did anything wrong.  Again  it may well be coincidental.  But I have to say Im not overjoyed with the experience.,1,0,395
A101NVN1GBVBL9,2323,I knew enough about wireless speakers reputation to be VERY wary about buying any. But when I saw these Emersons listed so cheap. I thought it would be worth the experiment. Im glad I didthey work fine for me.I  have simple needs. I  want to be able to listen to my computerbound MP3s a  few rooms away at the end of my apartment. and I dont care about perfect  quality. I just want my music to follow me while cooking dinner and hanging  on my porch.These speakers are a bit ornery. and it takes some work to  align things right. Luckily I have an airwell running the length of my  apartment. so I placed the antenna at the front of that opening. The signal  reaches into the near end of my far room. about about 25 feet from my  computer and the speakers antenna. and in the other direction 15 feet to  work on my porch. Despite the airwell trick. these are by no means line of  sight and there are a couple of walls the signal must pass through in  either direction. The receiverspeakers obviously have some digital  circuitry in them which try to lock in on the signal and they automatically  shut off when the static kicks up high.The battery outlay is the big  problem. 8 AAs per speaker. You can plug them in if you get 12V adaptors  but these cost USD12 each at Radio Shack. Im planning to hit the thrift  stores in the next week. though. and Ill be suprised if I cant find two  12V adapters for nexttonothing. So Im very glad I got these speakers.  theyre a lot more convenient than putting wire down for four rooms. It  seems like wireless speakers would be really hip now and that companies  would put some work into designing them better. but until they do these  Emersons are useful and enjoyableAS LONG AS YOU DONT EXPECT TOO MUCH!,3,0,1745
A102IUFPXVDRB6,67,The microphone works great at allowing me to record lectures on my iPod touch just a little inconvenient in the size department.,4,0,128
A102L0RVI4LHH3,0,It cleaned all three of my VCRs and everything play just well.  I would buy it again when need to,4,0,97
A102L3H9OM4EG1,12,I just received my bulldog 6002pro yesterday and I started installing it at around 1.00pm today and finished around 4.00. after drilling and mounting and everything. It was a fairly easy installation. just takes a while to mount the siren and connect some of the wires. It was actually a lot easier then I thought it would be and I recommend this to anyone who has atleast installed a subwoofer or amplifier before. A++++++,5,1,423
A102ZABPUPNYCT,0,Good quality. good audio and made by Motorola. Was going for a ear cover design but this is way sleeker.,4,1,104
A1038957GWRBP375RU5T,0,Awesome price and quality. Simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation. If you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one Id recommend.,5,0,165
A103XY7DJYZHFN,0,I thought this would be useful. but it turned out to be a bit disappointing.  The biggest problem is the volume  it is very loud. even with the volume control on the radio turned all the way down.  There is no way to make the volume any lower.  I had bought two  one for me and one for wife. for use on the boat. but she cant take the high volume. so one unit will never be used.  Also. the VOX capability of the Motorola radios is less than stellar.  At least it was not expensive.,3,0,482
A10484LD5RW5OF,11,These speakers sound like it is surround sound it looks good so when people come over you wont have to hide them i think these are great speakers.Hope you like them if u have the chance to get them!,4,0,198
A104SVEGLWBO3Y,0,Bought it for my 84 year old dad... He has usesused it every day for the past two years... No problems and he loves it!,5,0,119
A104VHQ06KFLDT,77,This headset is inexpensive. so dont expect a product you will have for years to come.  However it has good sound and the ear foam is denser than most low end product which makes it comfortable.,4,0,194
A1058D8UFZL711,66,I received the Nook Color as a Christmas present last year. I was expecting a IPAD but glad this was what I received.As a grad student a good number of my text books. had an electronic version and this made it a dream gift. The Nook saved my spine. time and GPA as it is easy to keep the Nook with you at all times. I simply pulled out my Nook on the SubwayMetro and read my assignments.This is where I felt the Nook has a great advantage over the IPAD for those who wish to carry their devices more than just on airplanes and meetings. But in the subway. on the bus. or someplace where you do not want to flash a 549 device. The Nook has covers that conceal the device in casing that appear to be a book or something else mundane.As for functionality as ereader. it has a range of books and magazines and it highlights. indexes and tabs pages with a few quick few touches.As a tablet. yes I said it. a tabletthe updated version 1.43 gives you a range of functionality. Angry Birds. Microsoft Office. Flash and I understand it has Netflix.  If it had the keyboard I would say it is perfect. A little extra tip. your Nook can be charged with your Android charger but it takes a slight bit extra time. Most of the functionality that is present on the Nook is all most users need. But Ipad has such cache that pay just need to pay the difference.Another small short coming is Amazon is a dream to work with but Barnes and Noble online is nightmare. But most issues can be troubleshot within the store and Barnes and Noble has excellent in store customer service.,4,1,1559
A105HXZN1VAS4D,33,This power strip is well constructed and looks very nice if used in an area where it cant be kept concealed. I found its appearance so appealing for a power strip that I bought another one. and will buy more as the need arises.,5,1,227
A105R38CAPDBGU,11,I love the idea of charging it in the USB port and how malleable and multifunctional it is .use as a boomkmark. freestand. etc.. My only complaint is that that are two separte lights on the head which isnt ideal for visibility .it creates two circles of light instead of a single expanse of light emitted from a single bulb..,4,1,325
A1077JEY0CE3BB,0,It is as good or better than a Kindle. but it does not have all the functionality for the PDF books.,4,1,100
A1079KKA0AXSL3,0,when i first bought this didnt think it was really gonna work.  I have a 32 inch tv though and this has been holding it for over two months and its still steady and equipped.  When you move the tv from side to side it shakes a little bit. but this is a good product for the price.  I am very pleased,4,1,299
A107WR4K28Y1QC,1921,I was sold on the reviews that I read and ordered the quick cam pro.  Upon opening the box the first thing I noticed was the lack of proper instruction material.  You have to read between the lines in the Quick  Campro users guide.  If you have anything connected to the printer port.  like a printer you will have to remove it and install the cam cable.  Which  means you cant use the printer.I would of liked to see a through  connector like what is on most scanners so a printer and scanner can be run  at the same time.  Now I have to get down on my hands and knees and change  the cable every time I want to use the printer or camera.So far the  camera does produce some great looking pictures both still and movie.,2,0,720
A1088LCAS58FXN,0,I knew this item was used. but assumed it was fully operational. It was so inexpensive. I decided to buy it because collapsible headphones with vertical ear buds are tough to get. Unfortunately. the right ear bud did not work. so I just threw it away. bought a new one. and chalked it up to experience.,1,0,302
A108H2BUNCYDIA,33,Certainly does the job  theyre not as durable as I might like. but if youre assembling a server rack or otherwise in need of a number of monitor  extension cables. you could do worse than this. I bought five and Im happy  with them  youre not paying for the Monster Cable kind of durability. I  havent seen any ghosting or other problems. even in a fairly crowded  server rack. although I can understand why the other reviewer would find  that to be a problem!,4,1,460
A108QN0VQPX1W2,0,I received these in perfect condition. They are used with a minicassette recorder. I have trouble with good sound from the cassette recorder. so I dont know if I have the correct type of cassettes or the recorder is of poor quality.,4,1,232
A108T72L8PVAKY,23,I got this about two weeks ago. and now Ive put it to a fair test. During driving. I think the so called u0026quotShock Protectionu0026quot saved it most of the time. after all. these arent the worst roads. But suffice to say.  it never skipped. So. it works great! However the car kit that came with it  only worked one time when I hit PLAY. and it only made output in the left  ear. Good thing I brought batteries! The AC Adapter is included as well and  is a nice touch. The headphones included are high quality. Finally. I  havent tried the cassette adapter. for I have no use for it when I could  have CD quality =. Why four stars then. and not five? Well. perhaps for the  poor car kit. but also for looks. Looks dont matter though. thats a silly  thing to judge. right? Go and buy it! USD50!,4,1,798
A10956KAP9F1CO,0,The skipping CD player in my 2006 car was not fixed by this product.  I may have been expecting to much.,2,0,104
A109WGT0FT4VCL,612,IT WAS THAT TIME.I HAD BEEFED UP MY RAM.VIDEO CARD UPDATED TO A NEW VERSION OF AOL.THE TIME CAME FOR A NEW MODEM.I READ UP ON SOME OF THE MODEMS BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS FACING WHEN I WALKED INTO THE LOCAL  COMPUTER STORE.BRANDS OF MODEMS I NEVER HEARD OF AND MY CONCERN WAS IT  GOING TO BE THE RIGHT CHOICE? 3 CLERKS GAVE ME 3 OPINIONS WHICH DIDNT  HELP.I FINALLY GOT THE CREATIVE MODEM 5630.IT BOASTED PNP.WELL THIS WASNT  THE CASE.AFTER 3 TRIES I GOT IT TO LOAD THE DRIVERS AND THE OTHER ADD ONS  WHICH WERE A PLUS.INTALLATION WAS 10 MINS TOPS. MY CONNCECTION SPEEDS WERE  INCREASED.I RARELY CONNNECT BELOW 48000BPS.DEFINITELY AN INCREASE FROM  44000.ASIDE FROM THE PLUG AND PLAY DIFFICULTY I WOULD SAY IT WAS WORTH THE  PRICE.,3,0,734
A10BSZ8SP5L1C6,77,The clips contain cables well. but the adhesive is a little weak.  I ended up having to tack the clips down with small nails to hold them in place.,3,0,147
A10CRNJHF5EMIN,33,I love these speakers.  They have a very nice low freq. response. but there is ONE problem.  It resonates at a wide range of bass frequencies. and has bad port air turbulance.  Something that should be fixed in the next model.  It is annoying when the speaker distorts though.  But still a  good system!,4,1,303
A10CY1HLD2P2Y0,23,I mostly use this in hotel rooms and its been nice having the short cable. Its flexible and the ends make a nice connection. I think with normal use this cable will last me a long time.,4,0,185
A10D6JE3EV2KUR,22,These tapes are performing very well during the process of converting old VHS to digital. They provide a good base from which I can get everything into my computer. Very cost effective!,4,0,185
A10DS2C9FZK12D,0,Just came back from Birch Run. Michigan .the reallife test site of my pair of TA280s AA model..Some 150 outlet stores scattered around the whole block. To go from one section to another. driving is often required. A pretty ideal place to use FRSs. especially your spousekids have very different preferences of stores to visit.I fullycharged a set of Maha 1550mAh NiMH AA batteries for each unit and started them off at around 10.00am. With frequent conversation. it lasted thru the day until I turned them off at around 10.00pm with 1 bar .out of 3. left at the battery indicator.I dont know the capacity of the proprietary Motorola NiMH battery for TA28x but Motorola claims 11 hours of normal usage .5%5%90%.. My 1550mAh NiMH AA setup beats this handily. Also. just imagine how much USDUSDUSD you are going to save from those disposable alkalines.I am quite pleased about the performance of my batteries as well as the FRSs so far. Highly recommended.,4,1,953
A10ELELHBVLYJJ,610,The item did not work from day one. After connecting all the wires to transmitter. speakers. and my television. nothing worked. At first one of the speakers did not come on. then I noticed that the transmitter light wasnt lite. Tried plugging it into five different outlets. It still hasnt come on.Tried contacting the seller. by phone. to no avail.Took the transmitter to a repair shop. they want to charge more than I paid for the whole set. This was a lost cause. It still doesnt work.,1,0,488
A10ESLO7OXX0YO,0,It is really nice.  It is a bit hard to get the charger connected while the case is still on.,4,0,93
A10GIA48NG0707,11,I got this alarm so that I wouldnt spend too much money. and it would be something to do on a weekend. When I got it. I was a little surprised  the sensor and speaker were one unit. It is big  there was no space for it under my 91 Honda Accord LX hood. I found a tiny dry spot under a 95 Civic hood. but installing it was a pain  there was no space to work. and could only drill two holes. it took about an hour to install it. So. installing in 10 minutes is a myth if you dont have large dry emty space under the hood.It is not very sensitive either. I have put it on the maximum sensitivity. It will go off if I slap on the hood. or close the door. It wont usually start when I open the door or turn on the engine. Maybe a Civics lights are not very powerful to create a current drain on the battery.But I like when the car talks. .o. If you save more than 50 bucks on insurance. you have covered your cost.,3,0,909
A10H764JFYKJ,1,Easy to handle. could be more convenient without having to add credit card information. Even with the security password there should be a more sufficient way than using a credit card not all people have credit cards.,3,0,216
A10I14YA0ZD07F,1717,I bought one a little while ago .206.. It does the job but seems chintzy. compared to the Sony I had before. The right hand well is noisy which is a drag since the deck is right next to me as I listenrecord. I do like that it has a pitch control .on deck 1 only. but wish it had a time counter rather than an index counter. It also has rotating heads which is just plain bad engineering. There is no need for that. I dont expect this unit to last long with rotating heads but there are so few dual well decks that record on both wells. this will have to do for now. It is also noisy as it reverses direction .heads rotating. and as it playsrecords.,3,0,648
A10IPCYAVM9XK8,12,I agree with the other reviews. the Koss Armband works as good .if not better. than the Sony one. I ask myself. why then does the Sony have to cost much more?,5,0,158
A10IPK523CLXBZ,11,I really enjoy this little radio. I can keep it in my truck without having to have a CB mounted. and I really like that. I also enjoy that I can use it as a portable .handheld. or a mobile .vehicle powered. with an external antenna.. Inside the box. you get the connector to power the unit with a 12v lighter. along with the connection for an external antenna. a battery pack for one time use batteries .6AA.. and another for rechargeable batteries .8AA. which includes a 120v charger for the rechargeable batteries.I was able to get my external magnet mount antenna tuned to some respectable numbers .under SWR of 1.5 on every channel.. and while this radio isnt the nicest out there. its perfect for what I need. For those who may be wondering. you CAN power this radio with the 12v plug and still use the provided rubber duck antenna. which is normally used when portable.Great for occasional use and offroad!,4,1,912
A10JZRQCC7IOVE,0,Am extremely pleased with the Kensington Orbit Mouse Trackball. This is the second one that I have owned and will continue to use the ball mouse when compared to the kind that moves on a mousepad.  The trackball uses less armwrist movement as well as less space to maneuver.  It sits in the same place all the time and for me it is easily controlled.,5,1,350
A10LQDTRU95IV,1,I purchased an old Dell Latitude D430 but it didnt have a hard drive. After popping it open I quickly found out why. Looked around for a local carried but there were none. I purchased this drive online via Amazon. Received it promptly from seller and installed it with no issues.Pros. The drive is quiet and uses very little battery.Cons. One note is that the drive is only 4200RPM so youll find it makes the laptop a little sluggish. I was just using it to build my Mom a cheap and portable laptop and it does the job very well. If it was faster I would have given it 5 stars.The seller was great and the drive was packaged with care.,4,1,635
A10LU4EDJ82UFQ,0,It can charge the phone while playing video.  The output quality seems to be good and produces a clean edge to edge image.I bought another mhl device a year ago. but I guess its not MHL 2.0. so it didnt work with the Galaxy S4.  If you dont buy the branded Samsung unit. Id suggest being sure you get an MHL 2.0 device. but Im not sure its worth the bother to experiment.,3,0,371
A10MAHE4M9SCK,11,No one has stolen my laptop yet. so Im not complaining!However. I havent done an overall strength test. so I dont know how effective it is.,4,1,139
A10MF6OJK61N22,0,2nd time i ordered this one . shipping much better this time. no problems. easy install. but be aware when you fold the mount flat there is a 12 inch difference between folding right or folding the mount left.,4,1,209
A10MH3OBX7DBEY,33,I was very happy with this drive. I bought it solely to transfer files  from my iMac to my NT machine. Its design complements the iMac perfectly  .and would add a splash of color to any PC.. What impressed me most was the  speed of this device. It is light years faster than any floppy drive. and  approaches nearhard drive quality. I was able to quickly drag and drop  large MP3 and Quicktime files. and get them over to my NT in seconds. Since  iMac doesnt ship with any removable media. this purchase was a nobrainer   especially considering the price.,5,1,555
A10N9KVV3DIUWD,33,Edit.  Well it has been over 7 years since I purchased and reviewed this shower radio and it finally bit the dust.  Radio still works .though lately I need to move it around a bit for best reception.and the clock is still really hard to see.  It is the volume button that is kaput. I can only get very loud and painfully loud.  Husband tried to fix it but couldnt do it.  Seven years is pretty good. I guess. I dont see anything better on Amazon. at least for this price. so I will probably purchase another of the same.  Something I did not mention in my original review.  the batteries seem to last forever.  Same number of stars for the same reasons.Original Review. This shower radio is attractive. compact and has great sound and station range. It is a 5 for the radio and a 1 for the clock. Unfortunately. the clock is very small and hard to read.  I purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink. but could not read the digital clock from there.  If the radio is placed too high or too low. the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame.  There is no back light which adds to the difficulty.  I had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where I stand and I still have to bend down slightly to check the time. If having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you. this Sony is for you.  If you really need a clock in the bathroom. this is not the one for you.,3,0,1429
A10NBGOUJOAJ4U,13,I bought my device on Amazon  new .  Tablet stopped working so I called Barnes and Noble who informed me that the device I purchased as  new  was used.  I am so disappointed in Amazon selling items as  new  when they are indeed  used .  I will be cancelling my amazon membership and returning everything I purchased from the site.  I am very upset.,1,0,348
A10NGYKJTJ1GM3,0,The Rio. for being a first generation MP3 player. is awesome. The design is well thought out. and simple. The audio quality is great at 128kbps. an in general it sounds u0026quotright.u0026quot I bought it mostly for jogging because I wanted to choose what I listen to. .Anyone who has been  interupted by commercials in a great part of their run can relate. Im  sure.. I wasnt looking for much. so this meets my expectations. Im not  much of an audiophile. so the features offered wasnt an issue. Price was.  and . . . for  32mb... Im happy.Ive only had my  Rio for three days. so I cant really comment on durability issues. My one  problem with the player is the headphone jack. It seems to be really cheap.  and so I worry about it being the first thing to fail. The software is  really cutsie. and easy to use. Being what I consider a power user. Id  rather see it simpler. and more streamlined. All in all. Im pleased with  my purchase.,4,1,941
A10NKN19P7TPWA,0,I love the nook! When I read the description and looked at the pictures I thought I was getting a green nook tablet cover. I did not. A touch misleading. however I do love my nook. Ive already bought and read 3 books and watch netflix all the time. I do wish the volume was louder.,3,0,281
A10NR1JXIFZYLC,33,Once you get through the extremely poorly written instructions. you are left with a very cool item! The sound on this in both wired and Bluetooth mode is amazing for such a little device. The quality as both a speaker and speakerphone is quite amazing. Great device just needs clearly written instructions.,4,1,306
A10OJS6YZNT0L6,8387,I purchased these speakers prior to reading the negative review and. needless to say. was prepared for the worst. I began setting them up. and was having problems getting a good signal and thought Oh well. guess this  was a waste of money. But then I realized I had the wrong AC power supply  hooked up to the transmitter .there are 3 power supplies  each specific to  the transmitter and speakers.. Once I corrected the supply problem. the  speakers worked beautifully. I use them as my surround speakers at a  distance of around 30 feet from the transmitter. Few negatives  the sound  is a little hot and tinny. even with the bass boost button on .but for 80  bucks. sounds great. and even though the speakers are capable of running on  4 D batteries each .not supplied.. the batteries will die quickly .24 hours  of use or so.. But overall. I am quite pleased and find them to be a great  deal.,4,1,897
A10ONZJPXOK6G7,22,The Amazon page gives dimensions of the package. Here are some specifics regarding the product alone.15 oz. weight. not incuding cord. measured on my kitchen scales6.5 inches. Outside diameter of circular part2 inches or a little less. Height. with nothing plugged into itThe underside of the circular part is flat with six flat rubber legspads upon which it rests. Therefore. it does not slip on my granite countertop.Problem that this product solved. My kitchen and den are separated by a granite countertop. and on the den side my easy chair is backed right up to that countertop. I wanted sockets that could be accessed from either side. for cooking appliances .in the kitchen. or for plugging in my iPad or Kindle .while using them in the den.. I cant imagine why an outlet wasnt thought of when my house was first built. I was going to call an electrician to add one. but this power strip seems to work just as well.How it solved my problem. The power strip does not budge or fall off the counter even when I am using the plugged in iPad. I could only make it slip off if I pulled it hard in a horizontal direction. The cord is long enough to reach the nearest wall outlet in the den. The price .USD40+. seemed high a first. but getting an electrician out here would have cost a lot more.,5,1,1294
A10P8UG177H2XR,0,The Palm V and Vx may have seemed totally awesome. but I never fell for the hype. The Palm V and Vx have a rechargeable lithium battery. When its day is done. theres an agonizing choice. go for a replacement one of these. have the battery replaced and risk it not working correctly. or buying something that as one user suggested could run off of easily replaceable AAA batteries. The Palm V and Vx were never cool enough to overcome that stigma for me. If you can find that the Palm VVx has an acceptable set of trade offs and opportunity cost. to quote a drop dead gorgeous economics teacher I had. then it is definitely the belle of the ball. If on hand B you are practical. and want more steak and less sizzle from your handheld. the Palm VII or Palm VIIx may be a far better option.Just alerting you to something the positive reviews may gloss over.,2,0,854
A10PIAYSZULLDX,22,Really am enjoying the new JVCCD changer.  Its easy to install and easy to use  no more changing discs in a cartridge!  The controls are easily read and the remote makes it a pleasure to do!Thanks JVC!John Scaduto,5,1,213
A10QQWAYZVX2QS,0,There is really not much you can say about a clean wipe. The product does clean fingerprints on the DVD. Im very satisfied with the product. If it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better.,4,1,223
A10RFZ7WJD1Y2C,55,Although. being honest. I should admit that its my first ergonomic keyboard. but I had a chance to use all kinds of other regular keyboards for more that 14 years of my computerrelated experience. You must know that this keyboard appears to be highly reliable .so far.. its not light. it does have a very convenient key layout and a good key action. Its not noisy. not too easy or too hard to press. And yes. it does look cool. I never had an  ergo keyboard before. because I dont believe in lowquality and overpriced MS products. Also. Logitech keyboards and too expensive and I never liked black keybaords. which Logitech somehow prefers to offer.Belkin products usually offer a great value and reasonable quality .often their quality is higherthanaverage.. and this keyboard is no exception. It comes with a PS2 to AT adapter .USD58 value.. which is necessary for users of older desktop systems or for those who use older types of keyboard extension cables.Everyone in my household now wants one like mine. so I will probably order three more ErgoBoards. Also the Pro version should be considered by those who want a USB hub.,5,1,1128

A10S9NK38WEQ65,0,Very concerned over hanging a 46  tv on the wall.  Got this mount due to low price.  Very impressed.  No doubt it will handle a 30 TV.  Allows full 90 degree rotation with 21  from wall to centerline at maximum extension.,4,1,221
A10SMIP52Q1W9W,0,I bought three of these mice to use at my store since the POS systems work on an old version of Microsoft. We have tried the optical mice but the jump all over the screens and we need to be precise where we get the cursor to go. I searched and found this PS2 Mouse. bought 3 for the store and the first day they already stopped working! I have to open them up 45 times a day to move the sensors and get them to move all over the screen. Right now. they will move right to left. but not up and down. Bad purchase and waste of money!,1,0,531

A10SRJNBFF2BGY,0,My hubby and I bought this Wet Cleaner. due to the fact that we still have VCRs at home. Needed this cleaner to keep the heads clean after much usage. We liked it. but eventually. we will have to join the 21st Century and start getting DVRs  since it is impossible to but new .old. VCRs. It did the job. but this product can not be used all the time!,4,1,350

A10UOP8HQMY7GX,11,Okay this is definitely a cheap way to get a new computer but there are hidden expenses if you dont do any research. First off you really want to buy the USD50 SD preprogrammed card so that you have access to other apps that are not available in this product in its original form. Once that is done you have a great computer that meets most of your simple computer needs. Dont throw out your old computer though.I had this tablet less than a year when I discovered a fairly well hidden issue. It has an irreplaceable battery. Stupid I was that I didnt see this as an issue when doing my research. I have learned a lot in a year. I will buy a cheap tablet next time and throw it away when it becomes obsolete in less than a year. At 320 bucks this was not a cheap tablet. My friend just bought one for 69 bucks and it does everything mine does.,2,0,843
A10UW8DCREFXL0,0,The Nook Color eBook is very easy to read with the facility to enlarge the print and the good backlight.  Its small enough to carry in a purse and has very adequate battery life.

A10VFPVJMRF585,44,When I bought this headset I was prepared to be disappointed and prepared to accept it based on the low price.  I already had a VTech cordless phone so I went ahead.  I have been pleasantly suprised and pleased with this headset.  It works fine and fits my ears as it does my wifes.  I got it for her initially as she wanted to be able to talk on the phone whilst doing other things.  I now use it too and Ill probably get one for work.,4,1,436
A10X9ME6R66JDX,3233,I needed an external CDRWDVD drive for my Toshiba NB205.The Acer Aspire One USB External DVDCDRW CD Burner suits my need perfectly. For my purposes. a drive has to read and write disks reliably and quietly thats it. I dont need it to be especially fast or to look pretty. Fortunately. for me this external drive is quiet. unobtrusive. and reliable.It has one eccentricity that Ive found. It comes with two USB cables  one for data. one for power  and so you might find yourself in the position of connecting two USB cables from your laptop to this device. I do think its weird. Ive never seen this before.Ive had no technical problems of any kind with this device. I am thoroughly satisfied.,4,1,691
A10XHD1A77CTN,0,I think other reviews said it did not have a cable but it comes with a cable .not a removable cable either. and I plugged it in and it came up as drive A. and just worked on the 3 or 4 floppies I tried it with. took data off of and then erased.  I have a whole bunch more to do that with.I would have given it 5 stars if I had done worked with all the other floppies because then Id know more about its longevity but I have not had the time.,4,1,441
A10Z23JLBY8AEM,0,This is the first mouse I bought after I bought a computer.  Its price is very affordable. and it performs very well.  It is a very straight forward mouse. yet has some nice features like programmable mouse button and adjustable sample rate for PS2.  What it doesnt have are the fourthfifth  thumb buttons.  but if you havent tried it. you wont miss it.  Buy it if  youre looking for a really good mouse thats not complicated. but if  youre looking for the best mouse on the block. get the Intellimouse from  MS.,4,1,512
A10ZA4JE3XITIM,11,Didnt work and caused static in the existing phone line.  I bought this to get my dish network box connected to a phone line.  Needless to say I am still paying the monthly service fee and now have a useless piece of junk in my closet.,1,0,235

A110O89E8N4JIF,12,Although the nook color offers the ability to browse the internet. watch streaming video .netflix.. and play games. in the end it is really just an eReader.  The video is very choppy for watching streaming video.  No one likes watching a netflix movie with a bunch of squares on the screen.  Barnes and Noble has its own OS. therefore many of the games that are free in the android market cost on the nook color .specifically angry birds..In the end. if you want this to play some games .free or those you are willing to play. this would be okay.  Especially since you can add an Micro SD card to expand the memory available.  But. if you want to get this for someone who will watch netflix on it...or use it for really anything other than an eReader. I would think twice about not just getting a tablet.  The cost isnt that much and the reward is great.  Plus. tablets can read eBooks just as well.,2,0,899
A111VR0F3ZVYHO,1,The difference between the product I received .47  and what the product is listed here on Amazon .50  .12 . isnt that big of a difference.

A112IT2DEJQTM5,12,I used a Microsoft Intellimouse Trackball for 3 or 4 years. at first out of necessity. When I bought my first computer back in the stone age. the mouse it came with was largish. and flimsy. Being a student. the desk I had bought to house my screamin new cyrixpowered system had very limited space. especially on the keyboard tray. I was peripherally aware of trackballs from playing the odd game of Centipede. as well as a math teacher who swore by his primitivelooking. boxy model. At my local CompUSA. this was the cheapest model with a scroll wheel. so it was the one for me. The trusty offwhite and gray trackball was my computing companion throughout college. outlasting several keyboards. and guiding the cursor on at least three PCs. After school. it followed me to my first. then second jobs. invaluable to a budding GIS analyst. About every other month. though. it would crud up. as ballbased pointing devices will. and I would clean it with qtip and toothpick in hand. By and by. though. it lost accuracy. and the internal rollers failed to contact the ball and read its motions well. I tried to replace it with another MS trackball. theMicrosoft D6700001 Trackball Optical Mouse. but I couldnt get used to rolling with my thumb. and so took to using whichever mouse was handy. A few years back. my right pinky and ringfinger started going numb occasionally. so I looked back into trackballs. and eventually settled on theLogitech Cordless Optical Trackman .USBPS2.. which has served me in good stead since.,4,1,1517

A117DLMF45FD85,33,These Yamaha speakers are perfect for a person looking for a pair of decent speakers for their computer.  I just got them today and within 10 min. I had them hooked up to my computer. pumping out songs.  The satellites. although small. provide wonderful highs and the base coorelates perfectly to the song. The speakers are small enough that they fit anywhere you want them.  If there is one thing that these speakers wont do. its blow you away with bass.  The bass is good. but you have to remember that the sub is only 18 watts.  Overall though. I would recommend these speakers to anyone looking for a good pair at a great price,4,1,631

A11DJX3UKJD737,12,I purchased this through Amazon. The first one was late and determined lost in shipping. Amazon immediately sent another one overnight one day delivery.It worked great accept for the rechargeable battery transceiver and plug. The plug didnt seem to fit completely into the transceiver. so Amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out 2 day post.That unit has the exact same issue. It will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose. I even went out and bought eight new Radioshack rechargeable AA. cost USD38. to make sure it wasnt the batteries. It wasnt.This unit gets NOA crystal clear in my truck as well. but no CB channels get any reception.Instead of shipping this one back to Amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another CB maker. I called Midland Radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug. If that doesnt work it goes back and I will buy elsewhere.,2,0,939
A11E2USO989A37,0,A wonderful opportunity to obtain a copy of the complete Arp Atlas together with additional supporting data. This work provides a fine opportunity for insight into the outstanding work of a premier American observational astronomer who unfortunately has been forced to continue his outstanding research in Europe.

A11H5YU6EZAAA8,44,This is a great little radio.  I use it in an automobile with a midland magnetic mount external antenna.  You have to be sure and tune the antenna.  This will require a SWR meter and a short coax cable.  Amazon sells all the stuff you need.  You can google how to do it. Before I tuned my antenna. I wasnt getting very good performance. but after tuning it. I can sometimes get a range of 20 miles.  Usually its in the 10 to 15 mile range.  The radio also comes with a battery pack and a flip antenna so you can use it as a handheld.  Very versatile radio with a lot of equipment standard.  Ive been commuting long distances to work for years and have heard hundreds of books on tape and then CD.  I know all the songs on the radio.  I got this for entertainment. but it is useful as well.  Several times I was warned of traffic conditions that let me take and alternate route and not get stuck in traffic.  Ive had the unit about for several months now and it has worked flawlessly.,5,1,983

A11HYG0TO8RQLD,2224,Considering the outrageous prices for speakers these days. I decided to go with these and am not disapointed. The sound quality is excellent. and the set up was harmless. I currently have it hooked up to my computer. but have  also used it with my TV and CD player.The only quabble I have is the  volume control. Its placed in the far back of the right speaker. which is  hard to reach sometimes. Its also a knob. which is awkward to control  horizontally .knobs are meant to be on a vertical plane.. Personally I  wouldve preferred a thumb control.Otherwise. these are excellent  speakers for the price.,4,1,604
A11I82LD703DR2,0,The unit was very clean and looked unused.

A11IJ1DUN5DGMH,1251,I bought this wet cleaning system about 20 years ago. and it still works.  I hadnt used it in many years. but a friend asked me to copy his VHS tapes to DVDs. since I have a Panasonic DVDVCR recorder. that records to both DVDs and VCR tapes.  Since his tapes were old. they werent the best quality.  I wanted to make sure that I got the most out of his tapes. so I dug around and found this cleaner.  The bottle of solution had dried up. but its only alcohol. so I just used a bottle of regular rubbing alcohol .Isopropyl alcohol..The Maxell unit still works. and I noticed improvement when I played his tapes. so I know it still works.  The only thing that is better than using this cleaner is to open the DVDVCR. and wipe the recording head with alcohol.  Its a quick and easy job. but this Maxell unit does a decent job.  If the head was really dirty. Id have cleaned the head by hand.If you want to clean the head by hand. just take out the screws that hold the cover on the VCR. and remove the cover.  That big. silver looking thing that is tilted on an angle. is the recording head.  Just wet a cotton ball with alcohol. and wipe it all over the head.  Make sure you wipe the entire head several times. using several clean cotton balls that are wet with alcohol.  You can also wipe the rubber rollers that move the tape along to clean the tape residue that is on them.  By the time you get the cover back on the VCR. the heads will be dry and ready to use.,4,1,1462
A11J6QQBJU1L89,2,I purchased my Rio 500 a few months ago and have been amazingly happy with this product!  I must have it running 24 hoursday!  I love it that much.  Recently. it stopped working.

A11K16GM7AZ4S9,2728,Im a long time Palm user. After two days with the 5mx. Im a convert.The bad news about the 5mx. It is larger than a Palm III. Palm V. Visor. etc. The screen contrast isnt great.The good news.1. It has a keyboard. I find input of text much faster and easier than the Palm even though I am fairly experienced with Graffiti.2. It has 16MB of RAM and is expandable with off the shelf CompactFlash cards. One of the first things I did was purchase a 48MB CompactFlash card.3. You can program in perl. java. or python on the 5mx.4. There is a lot of freewareshareware available. Not as much as for the Palm. but still I find that software is available to duplicate almost all the functions that I used on the Palm.5. The 5mx can multitask.6. The builtin Email client can use POPIMAPSMTP to fetch and deliver mail to an ISPs mail server.7. The screen is big enough that web browsing on the 5mx is actually fairly practical.8.

A11KPB9VZP8LIG,77,I bought this player about a year ago.  I have always respected the JVC name.  Not any more!  I too have experienced the same u0026quotlockupu0026quot problems.... u0026quotArlington Roadu0026quot messed up my player so bad that I had to call JVC for advice.  They gave me a reset  procedure that worked. but only temporarily.  My player continued to have  this same problem on other disks as well. I also encountered some MAJOR  audio and video distortion while watching u0026quotNotting Hillu0026quot.  I took  that disk to a friends house and it played perfectly with no prblems  whatsoever on his RCA player.  I have also had problems with accessing  certain special features .cast biographies. trailers. etc.... on some  disks.  Once again. these DVDs played fine on other players.The features  on this player are very nice. but they dont do any good when the player  wont play DVDs....,1,0,891

A11MI681ISNGZW,33,This is possibly the best USD5 speaker system ever!  The sound is just like a normal computers sound. there is no metallic sound that you can sometimes get with these kind of speakers.  I plug this into my laptop because it is better than my normal speakers.  The only real problem is the removable iPod tray needs to be slipped in backwards when you fold the speakers up. blocking the audio cable.  Overall. this is a great product for the little money it costs .of course it is not nearly as good as a USD100 speaker system..,5,1,527
A11N54DYZ6NT3K,1822,I have mixed feelings about this category of laptop locks.  It wouldnt stop someone with a pair of good wire cutters.

It provides a little peace of mind in such situations.Thanks for reading,4,1,501
A11N80Z6MTAYS4,0,I bought this product believing it to be an official HDMI adapter which would work on the Note 2 from .Verizon..

A11NLVWA0MTSGH,1216,This is an exceptional tv wall mount. It is very easy to install. It comes with a variety of screws to match the back of the television. The mounting screws are improved and very adequate. It took longer to decide where to place it than it did to actually install the mount and television.

If you are looking to get great performance. all of your favorite am programs like Rush. Hannity. Dr. Laura. sports. weather. locals. etcthis is the radio for you and you cant beat the price.

A11YO1S0X29W9Y,22,I got this to use on my Honda VT600 motorcycle.  When riding with a group we have CBs so if anything goes wrong for any reason you can let the others know.  I have used ties to secure it to my left mirror. I have power to it from my motorcycle.  I bought Midlands CB thru the glass antenna and attached it to my windshield.  I also purchase Midlands headset made to go with this radio.  I cut the part that goes across my head off so all that was left was the speaker and mic.  The speaker fit inside my helmet with very little pressure against my ear.  Works Great.  Completely happy with it.,5,1,593
A11YUH1WVD236C,0,I purchased 2 mounts a few days apart. They were both VideoSecure and were the same price.  I purchased this one 2nd thinking it was the same as the 1st. but it wasnt.  This isnt a bad mount and was easy to attach to the wall.  However. most Wall Mounts let you detach the plate that screws into the back of the TV.  This one doesnt so once you attach to the wall you have to hold up the TV and have a 2nd person screw it on from the back. Not a  big deal. but most others including the 1st one I bought let you do this.Heres the other model.  Buy it instead!!VideoSecu LCD LED TV Wall Mount Full Motion with Swivel Articulating Arm for 2337. up to 42 in TV Flat Panel Screen With VESA 200 100. 20 in extension and Postinstallation Leveling System A35by VideoSecu,3,0,763
A11ZP93TJED4T6,18,The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it. so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall. or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.to its benefit though. it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install.,2,0,386

A121EXCANKL7MZ,11,This cable. along with any other cable you try to connect to the Sanyo 2700.  will not help you transfer photos from the phone to the computer.

A12260EDCTLAB,22,When I won a PalmVIx in a raffle. I was determined to make the most of it. As an author. I had been frustrated with my lack of mobile computing capability and this seemed to be a godsend. However. for any extensive writing. the stylus soon made my hand cramp and reduced the usefulness of the handheld.All this changed after I bought the keyboard. Its large enough to touchtype at a speed almost matching that of my desktop machine. so Im now able to write whole chapters on the Palm while Im on the go. and come home to put them on my desktop machine.,5,1,552
A122V6088ZROIN,1617,I was very hesitant about this headset as it was only 10 bucks but I have had great luck with it.  I can hear well and the people I am talking to say I come across very clearly as well.  I think it is a good deal and a good  product.  I love being productive and being able to talk on the phone at  the same time.,4,1,313

A1239Z4A1E1LPY,2729,Now of coarse your thinking well for 5 dollars how good can this thing be?  Well I bought it.due to lack of funds. but amazingly I love it!  For 5 dollars this is one deal you cant beat especially with the portable volume  control feature.  It isnt a perfect fit but the deep bass and clear music  make up for that by far.  So if you are not sure to buy an expensive set of  headphones or a cheap brand. this time I think cheap is the way to go.,5,1,445

A123JZDWHMYH5Q,1515,I got my 950 a couple of months ago after owning a cheap digicam. The difference in the photos is astronomical.  I decided to purchase it because of so many positive reviews.  Yes. it isnt easy to figure out the controls. but its worth it when you do. The camera is capable of some pretty incredible photos.  I got a couple sets of nimh recharge batteries. and a usb card reader and a 48 mb flash card.  I print out photos on glossy paper on my fine Epson printer. and nobody can tell that it was from a digicam.  I would like to eventually get an external flash and a telephoto lens.  It is nice to be able to add these options.  I havent even used the high res setting yet. and have gotten some great 8x10 prints on the default medium res setting.  Any problems so far that Ive had with it have been only because I hadnt figured out the right way to use it.  No camera is perfect. but this baby comes pretty close.  I dont think that I will ever pick up my film camera again!,5,1,977
A123WML9K2WDX4,33,I bought this Keyboard as a replacement for my old. yet reliable and functional Fujitsu 4725. which weighs ~4lbs.  It wasnt all that I wanted it to be. but then again. it could have been because I was so used to the  Fujitsu I was using.  Im used to having that heavy keyboard. and those  Keys which give me a bit more tactile feedback than the Logitechs do.  Also. the heavier base tends to turn me on more.Some points to note.  The Wristrest. while detachable. is hard to remove wo the help of a small  flathead screwdriver. But w the aid of a tool. its fairly easy.  Logitech  has fixed this problem on its later models of keyboards .the iTouch ones.  by using a screw to hold a piece of plastic in place. holding the wristrest  there. The Keyboard is fairly light... so if lightness doesnt turn you on.  dont get it.As mentioned before. the tactile feedback is not as much as  some other keyboards  but this is all a matter of personal  preference.Overall. this is a good keyboard. made by a quality company.  If you dont want to spend a lot. at least spend this much for a quality  keyboard. Pretty much the best for its price. unless you pick up a good  deal on some used stuff.,3,0,1184
A123WML9K2WDX4,0,Bought this keyboard for my other computer... yeah... I guess i have too many computers.Its been an excellent keyboard. and I would have to say that i prefer this one over the Newer Logitech iTouch models. Thats my my personal preference. This one weighs a bit more. and feels a little more  sturdy. Whether that means anything or not. is up to you to decide.  The  cable is of adequete length. as long as your case isnt TOO far away from  your desk. and the responce of the keys is not unlike that of the Deluxe  104Keyboard by logitech.  The extra buttons. I find. arent really THAT  helpful. However. the logitech buttons and Function keys .when used in  conjunction w the included software. allows you to quicklaunch apps  easily. Good for those programs like Winamp. IE. or other ones that you use  frequently.IMHO. this is a great buy for its price. If youre looking  for a functional keyboard w a little more jazz than a regular one  get  this one. Dont get a nonamer.,4,1,975
A1242QJYLRKD39,11,Although this CD changer is slightly bigger than Id expected it works well. the change while playing feature is a vast improvement over my previous player. and it sounds great.  The programming interface seems very complicated. but who uses that anyway? It looks nice.,4,1,268
A124A40NAJDUEM,22,Ordered the memory and was happy with the cost of the product. It was told to me that I would see it on my doorstep in about two weeks. I received the notification that it shipped in two days. and was with me two days after that. Package was new and in a blister pack and undamaged.

A125KJE0RCKGHF,0,Wont be able to retape them either because they were first year episodes. and the other were shows you wont get in their entirety they would cost quite a bit to buy them outright.

Most will credit you or let you return product for a refund.,2,0,394

A127GZ51PD786F,11,This tape works fine for my label printer. The adhesive holds pretty well. It is not very flexible once you have it stuck on  I would not advise using it for labeling cables unless you use the  flag  method.

A127KI9JEAESJ1,22,1 Star because it doesnt work.Apple. 2013 iMac  drive wont even register. just clicks away.Apple. 2009 MacBook Air  same as above.MS Windows 7 on a 2012 Acer laptop.Pulled up directions at mfr. website. FLUDRV model number not found  its under SBTUFDB. Anyway. plugged drive in Windows 7 installed the driver checked to ensure it  mounted .  I even had Windows search for an updated driver. Nope. the current one is good. Then the fun. inserted a 1.44MB floppy disk with data the drive did not activate any Windows  window  like a CDDVD does. I had to bring up Windows Explore to view the drive. Clicked on it. the drive actuated  click. spin. zoom. zing. the green status bar showed progress! But alas. Message Window!

There is no manual on their website for it. There is for the SBTUFDB. though. I took a chance on a product that had 22% negative reviews .39 out of 174 were 2 stars and below..  The SBTUFDB fares no better with 61 out of 197 reviews rated 2 stars and below. Thats 31%!  Guess Ill keep looking.Bottom line  its going back.,1,0,1873
A127MTY4ZEQ16B,3234,The Palm iii is a great product. and the Palm iiix is definately worth the extra money if you run Outlook on your PC  within days youll wonder how you ever lived without it.  But it is fragile  really fragile.  Ive dropped my mobile phone on countless occasions. likewise my calculator. and  even my lap top once or twice.  And they all lived to tell the tale.  Drop  your Palm once. and you can be looking at a cracked screen and  Wham!  USD100 replacement fee.  Whats more. you can be waiting 35 days for a  replacement to arrive.  So if youre anywhere near as clumsy as me  buy a  case. and be very careful when youre taking it out,4,1,634
A127X09WZNT908,33,Ive researched the readers for about two years.I only buy electronics after I can give the item a test drive. Upon that note. I have always been a huge fan of Amazon.For the first time I could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question.The nook was available to be put through anything I wanted to try. First of all the new Nook in stores has the most recent upgrades. No problem with turning the page at all.touch screen worked great. In the store I downdoaded a book in under 1 minute and have downloaded 3 books at home that are nearly 1000 pages long in under 1 minute.The nook can connect to your computer .as does the Sony.. You can also download from other sources other than the dealer.The nook also downloads without any effort wifi . as does the Kindle..The nooks battery you can change at home. It also accepts a memory card. which allows you to expand your book collection.The Nook also has other advantages.but I was only wanted a reliable reader.Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package.,5,1,1114
A128I7HTR8MBQ,88,I bought the 5mx and promptly returned it.  The Good is this little thing is a true computer not just a fancy organizer like the Palm.  Its word program is very good.  The Bad is the screen contrast is quite poor in my opinion.  Without the back light. I had trouble seeing the text even in a well lit room.  Also. the key board is small .as expected.. but the disappointing part with the keyboard was I had to press firmly .kind of like a small calculator. for the key to register. as opposed to a soft touch like a computer.  This really slows down the typing process.  So for me. it just did not work out.  However. if the screen contrast does not bother you and you are a u0026quothunt and pecku0026quot typist anyway. this would be a great buy IMHO.  Like I said above. it really is a little computer!,3,0,806

A12A8LU93A132U,3636,I got a set of 250s for me and a climbing partner after we had an  accident and couldnt hear each other at the belays. Now anytime we think  we might not hear each other. we carry them. They are very sturdy and Ive  banged mine around a lot climbing. The extra weight is reasonable and the  bulk is minimal. Although the 280 is slightly smaller. the weight is just  about the same .heavier NiCd battery.. The extra money for the slightly  improved features isnt worth it. We thought the voice activation feature  would be handy during leading. asking for rope. slack and whatnot. hands  free .important while climbing.. However. we found that the delay in  activation sometimes cut whole sentences and unless you held the microphone  right to your mouth. it sometimes wouldnt activate at all. This kind of  defeated the purpose of the voice activation in the first place. So we just  use them at the belays when a free hand is available. They also came in  handy on a trip to Mexico where we didnt have access to our cell phone  service. Overall. a very useful climbing tool.,4,1,1075
A12BXBRPAODSDN,33,Great device. I have owned a kindle and returned it due to feeling it was not worth the money. The nook has way more features. and with android the possiblities are endless.,5,0,173
A12DH383W6S1NY,1919,I have owned a CX220 for over a year now and Imust say that after taking the trouble ofstoring 200 u0026quotclassicalu0026quot cds in a machine and slippingthe liner notes in 2 provided albums. it haschanged the way I listen to music so much sothat I am planning to add a second CX seriesfor contemporary recordings. It has proved tobe a reliable. very listenable device which haseliminated many shelves of dustcollecting casesin my living room. letting me explore my musicsans fingerprints at the touch of a button. Adding.or subtracting. music is a snap. It is easy tooperate for the technically challenged. but hasimpressive features for those who love to browsethrough owners manuals. I dont plan to jettisonmy CDs the way I did my scratchy vinyl .in mygarage mostly.. so I anticipate years of usefrom this wonderful and clever moderately pricedproduct.,4,1,857
A12DLJESJKM1OQ,22,Pros. Excellent value. great picture quality in SVHS. jogshuttle. SVideo inouts. Easy setup. cables included. quality construction. lots of features. OK tracking. Super VHS ET mode. 400+ lines of resolution. Has 19u Heads For Taping In The Extended Mode. Can Record Super VHS On Standard Tapes. do I need to say more?!?!Cons. Tracking problems in EP mode. flimsy. some color problems. Super VHS tapes may be hard to find and expensive. the menu system is kind of complicated. Clunky remote. traditional programming procedure. Front Display PanelThe Bottom LineThe HR3600U is a bargain u002665533 the picture quality. SVHS ability and features for USD are excellent.Highly Reccommended!!IntroductionMy reason for purchasing this VCR was simple. I wanted an inexpensive VCR with SVideo inputs. For those who may not know. SVideo inputs allow the transfer of 400 lines of resolution. as opposed to the usual 260 or so transmitted via RCA connections. In theory. the higher the resolution is the better the picture looks.FunctionalityIn addition to the VCR. there are a set of RCA cables and an SVideo cable included as well. Overall the unit is a piece of cake to setup. The unit has both RCA and SVideo jacks on the back. and a set of RCA jacks on the front. This makes it easy to hook up an external source .such as a camcorder or something. and record to VHS. I have my unit hooked up to my computer .it has a video card with SVideo out and RCA audio outs.. and I havenu002665533t actually used the input jacks on the front of the VCR. Another feature I really like is the simple 1touch recording button on the unit. The way I have it set up. I can just reach up from my computer and hit it. and off it goes.This unit has a jogshuttle wheel which is used to perform all the rewinds and fast forwards. Iu002665533ll have to say. this is my first experience with a shuttle wheel. I like it! It just seems more cool than a u002665533rewindu002665533 or u002665533fast forwardu002665533 button. Lol The unit rewinds tapes faster than my old Zenith VCR.The clock is easy to set as well. I think this is an area which has been greatly improved upon in recent years. For that matter. all the menu items are laid out in a common sense manner. which makes programming and such even easier.I noticed some were saying they didnu002665533t like the remote control. but I think it is just fine. Grant it. I donu002665533t use it much. but the times I have used it. I havenu002665533t encountered any problems with it.Two other things I really like are .1. Having a time code counter display on the LCD so you know how much youu002665533ve recorded. .2. When you rewind. this little bar pops up on screen and shows you where you are relative to the length of the tape. Itu002665533s not really super useful. but I just like knowing where Iu002665533m at.Picture QualityIu002665533ll have to say that for USD. this unit produces great quality dubs in regular VHS mode. Iu002665533ve been using it for several months now. and the video productions Iu002665533ve produced always come out looking very good. And thatu002665533s the most important thing! I havenu002665533t dubbed anything in SVHS or SVHS ET mode yet because none of my projects have warranted that. I would imagine that the picture quality would be even more outstanding than the regular VHS mode though.Nit PicksWhile the outer enclosure looks nice. the unit u002665533feels cheap. I donu002665533t think it would hold up too well under any kind of rough conditions. Hopefully this VCR will reside either in your home theater or a setup like mine where it stays put and isnu002665533t moved around too much.The cheesy u002665533glow in the darku002665533 keys on the keypad of the remote. I hate it when electronics manufactureru002665533s use these gimmicky things. They never work.ConclusionsFor the money. you just canu002665533t beat this VCR. The ease of setup and great picture quality are this VCRu002665533s strongest points. I highly recommend this VCR to anyone looking for a budget level VCR.,4,1,4053
A12DUUFZ6ECCH2,710,At first I thought the problem was with poor instructions. which is certainly the case. but this product is such poor quality that it simply doesnt work and never should have been marketed.  You cant even load a VHSC cartridge in it.  If you do follow their instructions. you will bend a little lever they dont bother telling you about. thus destroying the device.  Not that it would matter. it doesnt work anyway.,1,0,414

A12HFXYCCAJ7HG,77,Although there are four separate components and plenty of dials. toggles. and buttons. this is not the set for tinkerers who demand control of the sound. Theres a button that gives you enhanced bass and a dial that  supplies fine tuning of the tweeter. and thats it! Not even the ability to  balance the speakers.  The flip side of course is simplicity. and  simplicity is the name of the game from assembly to operation of these  handsome components and speakers. Just link everything  together. plug it  in. and enjoy impressive sound. Impressive. that is. for everyone but those  who want to rattle the walls with amplified rock and loud orchestral  compositions. They should look elsewhere. But for those who. like my wife  and I. live in snug apartments and whose tastes run to smallgroup jazz and  classical chamber music with emphasis on solo piano. violin. guitar. sax.  and trumpet. Technics has put together a terrific audio system. Just  squeeze it in wherever theres room and let it fill your space with warm.  balanced sound.,4,1,1038

We have 60 acers of woods. hills.some are more like cliffs.and thick brush.  We run ATVs and we got closer to 2 12 to 3 mile range on these bad boys.  I droped mine several times while on the 4 wheeler and the radio still works great.  Not even a scratch.  This could have been prevented with the many holders that are made for them.

A12N0PL2CVVB6U,1718,These little speakers are great!  I was just using some extra money on a gift card and decided to order these.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well they sound...

They are great for us to take on vacation to the beach. take out on our deck and by the pool....  we have a lot of fun with them.  The battery life is good. the only draw back is they do not come with an AC Adaptor.  Other than that. I think this is a great product for the price....,4,1,605

It has a adapter tape for your car so if you dont  have a CD player you  can play your CDs. and a connecter so if you run out  of batteries you can plut it into the wall and listen. It has great sound.  small in size so its easy to travel with. an attractive body. nice  headphones and a great price.  If your looking for an excellent player at a  reasonable price youve found it!,5,1,547
A12Q04YZ1OX7QS,2122,After searching this section and reading the reviews of this product. I finally thought I had a 900 mhz speaker set that would work. So I ordered it. Big disappointment. It seems to work fine within about a 10 foot radius  of the small signal station. but beyond that reception is sketchy at  bestnot even as good as my 900 mhz phone. oddly. In particular. the  system seems to have problems when the speakers are not in lineofsight  contact. So while this may be an okay system to create u0026quotsurround  soundu0026quot near your TV. its really not powerful enough to use as a way  to carry signals from your stereo into other rooms.,2,0,636
A12Q38GH8B15F8,22,This is a big radio with very good sound. For the price. it is an absolute bargain. I strongly disagree with the reviewers who give it negative reviews. You should take note that I am not an expert on radio. I listen most often to AM broadcasts. Kansas City Royals baseball games to be exact. .Yes. I am a glutton for punishment..In my first edition of this review I complained that the signal seemed to wander and I had to retune from time to time. After some hours of use. that problem seems to have gone away. Maybe the radio needed some burnin time.There are a couple of problems that could be fixed.First. the controls are clumsy. Do you see those three knobs on the right hand side of the front? Those are. from top to bottom. treble. bass and volume. The radio would be much easier to use if the voulume knob were on top and a bit larger than the other two.Second. a signal strength meter of some kind would help a lot.Finally. if GE would fix these problems and add a TV band. this would really be a super. super radio.,4,1,1027
A12QKB1WM59KRO,22,This CD player lasted about 3 weeks before the antiskip feature broke.  When engaged. the player now inserts random horrific screaming static.  I have relegated the player to a shelf in my workroom where it works fine .as  long as you dont turn on antiskip.!,1,0,258

A12SBVZP1QK9GM,11,Works well! I needed a shorter cable that would not get in the way. but allow me to move away from my desk .7 Foot.. I can enjoy higher speeds with this CAT 5e cable connected vs my wireless connection. I like the snagless design it offers good protection from tab breakage.Belkin International. Inc.. is a American manufacturer of computer hardware that specializes in connectivity devices. headquartered in Los Angeles. California. I feel all warm and fuzzy supporting a American company.I have purchased Belkin cables in the past and i still have a few of their cables laying around they are still working after years of use. I have some missing tabs on a couple of my generic CAT 5e cables. This is the reason for my interest in Belkins snagless design. Without the locking tabs the cables slip out if moved.,4,1,812
A12SCN3V42DINX,34,I didnt buy it on amazon because it was WAY TO EXPENSIVE but I got mine for 140USD at Best Buy or you can get it at Barns and Noble for the same price.

A12UGBVBI2NI7X,1720,Item Description says nothing about this item being a DVDCD RW unit.

A12UM2PCEZ4G0X,11,The item shipped to me has the correct mini USB connector but does not work with my Nuvi 1450. The description in the package says its for a Motorola V3.

A12VM2HHWDK2WA,1718,Great radio with all 14 channels and 38 privacy codes. yet you dont need a license. Unfortunately dont be fooled by the privacy u0026quotcodesu0026quot. Your conversations can still be monitored by other radios. Nice features like a backlit display lets you see the display in the dark and lock alows you to prevent accedental channel changes. Also includes an accessory jack for an optional handsfree .VOX. or pushtotalk headset. Bottom line. great 2way radio with wonderful range and reception .up to 2 miles. except for the cons listed above and a incovieniently located talk button.,5,1,586
A12W4CJSDMKBFS,0,I think these were a bit over priced for what you get. I may be at fault for imagining you could cut these into smaller tags to use on more than one cable. but at that price I think you should receive a bit more.It is reusable and water proof though.,3,0,250

A12XCRHPREC51Y,0,Only gave this four stars because its only supporting a 32  TV. I think I would be scared to mount a 55  TV on it. If you sprang for a 50  or bigger TV. spend a little more on a properly rated mount. As with any TV mount. make sure youre hitting wall studs with the main screws. dont just use anchors in drywall or youre asking for trouble. LOTS of hardware included in the kit. so mounting any style or brand of TV shouldnt be a problem.,4,1,438
A12XGU94N4N42Z,56,I bought this product because Im impressed with the feature it has. and as a customer support engineer I need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to  carry on the street. Most of the time I carry it as a backpack. But its  not tough as it should be. It last only 1 month and the inner side between  the padded computer compartment began to tear. Because it has a lifetime  warranty. I went back to the shop and got a new one. After a month plus the  inner side .I will say it as a weakness. starting to tear again and then I  will go back to the shop to replace it.,2,0,631
A12XMPGNLP63OU,11,My Xbox 360 kept giving me disc error messages. telling me to clean the disc.  I had this cleaner laying around and gave it a try. been playing for hours now and no more messages.  Only downside is instructions are kinda lame. basically put it in and go to track 2. even though it says track 3.  Will use once or twice a year from now on.  Nice!!,4,1,346
A12XVN9SFHS840,22,Overall the case is decent. It doesnt feel cheap. but it certainly doesnt feel as nice as youd expect for this price.More disappointing though was the flawed design. The case says its meant for both right handed and left handed writers. however. fails to mention that its default is for left handed .notepad on the left. iPad on the right.. When you switch the notepad around so its on the right. the iPad Mini faces down .ie. the wrong direction.. It doesnt seem so bad except the camera is then pointed in the wrong direction and the cover as well. Thus you either hold it backwards or open and flip it upside down to be on the proper side.These seems like a trivial problem. but when youre paying for a brand that charges for their design aesthetics. its a bit disappointing. I mean. what percentage of the population writes predominantly with their left hand? I have no issue with it working for both sides but why not have the default option be created for the 80% of the population or make an option that switches back and forth more eloquently. Instead of having your case and iPad face the wrong way for the majority of your customers.Also the paper inside is not lined for those who might be interested to know.,2,0,1220
A12XZAWK0UPP5T,1618,My USD599 PC plus AllinWonder simply made a perfect system for me. I can do video recording. 3D games. and dual monitor on Win98!I would have given five stars for this product if its software is stable enough. The  bundled software suite .6.0. has problem in many corners. Basic TV and  video functions are OK. But things like closed caption are not stable yet.  I hope ATI will fix the software and complete this awesome product.,4,1,430
A12Z4AXEA93WMU,0,I bought these headphones to use with my ipod while I work out and go for walks.  I dont want the volume so loud that it blows my eardrums out but I want enough to hear my music over fitness equipment and average traffic noise.  With the volume all the way up. I still had the music drowned out by outside noises.  I have other earphones and ear plugs that deliver a higher volume so unless youre using these in a fairly quiet enviroment. these headphone wont deliver.They do fit comfortably on my head and ears but I cant hear my music.,2,0,537
A1307OFMNSVKFC,5151,I went to a department store to find a camera bag. unfortunately they didnt stock Targus.  But I did come across the Case Logic DC50 case.  I like it.Layout and size.It has a great accessory pouch .with mesh pockets. not sure how durable they are..  A zip pocket big enough for 2 canon batteries and memory card. + another pocket for memory. and room for AA batteries .if applicable..  There is padding everywhere as far as I could feel. although it is quite thin .all cases I saw had as thinner or thinner padding..  The inner .camera. pocket is approximately 15cm .6in?. high. 8cm .a bit more than 3in. wide and 4.5cm .less than 2 in. deep .these are rough measurements with a ruler..For Canon S30.* It is a little large for the Canon S30 as you can tell from my rough measurements.  However. with the all weather case it might be about right .dont know yet..* To give you a rough idea ... if the camera is still in bubble wrap then it is almost the right size .except for height..If you find a better case for the S30. then let me know ..  Otherwise I will happily use the DC50 case ..If the height is too big you could always put some extra padding down the bottom of the bag.  For example just cut some bubble wrap to size and put it at the bottom of the comparment.,4,1,1271

A132FCKZZYSHBY,4345,ive read all of the reviews here and the consistent messages are that a.the card works well. b.if you have the right kind of PC. c.theres no good way to tell if you have the right PC and d.Pinnacle as a company isnt going to help you if you have problemsBoiled down. the product description and information on the box are severly misleading. resulting in a *lot* of .rightfully. angry customersMy personal experience  im a computer pro with a firewireilink Digital8 camera .sony dcrtrv320. and an average computer .P2400. 160MB memory. 2 Western Digital 40GB hard drives. Windows98. all latest drivers.. i capture via firewire to a dedicated. defragmented hard drive with all background processes shut down. at least 50MB physical .nonvirtual. RAM free. The capture claims to drop about 25% of the frames for a 15s capture .ditto for longer captures.. Playback looks like it stutters between 10fps and 2 seconds per frame .*lots* of hiccups.. Audio is botched as well as being unsynchronized. Resulting AVIs are unwatchableQuestion. what do i change to fix this? Pinnacle wont tell you. and the software and its online help are useless. Should i upgrade the CPU. memory or HD? To what? Theres no way for the average person to know. The software is also confusing. i cant figure out how to turn off Capture Audio. When you pick a project. you have to specify things like MPEGAVI. PALNTSC and 320x240640x480. but those options appear to have no effect on the capture. The captureasMPEG option always fails. Clicking on Add VoiceoverMusic always crashes my PC. Dont expect progress bars. even though simply pressing a button can lock up the application for 120 seconds or moreThis is *not* a good product for beginners. im no film expert. but i know PCs and im frustrated. No way id want someone else in my family to attempt this. i spent a month trying to get it to work. It spent the next year untouchedAssuming the card actually works the way some people here say it does. this product *majorly* needs better support  better help files. system checkcompatibility tools. an upgrade guide. bettermore honest info on the box. dummies guide to PC movies. etc.,2,0,2155
A132P6YSJSI5G2,22,never was loud enough. trying to get rand to repair it now. had to buy a new set of head phones to find out if the problem was in the speaker or elswhere. hole for audio output is 2.5mm. really a bad idea rand! all external speakers have 3.5mm plugs. mp3 players 3.5. pain in the butt. i loved my tom tom but 53 foot trl. and residential areas dont mix. tom tom has 35? different voices .... rand 2. speed limit for trucks in il. is 65 on interstates except for chi. area but rand says 55 everwhere. needs a seperate clock. not just eta or clock. needs both. loved the announcement ... arrive dest. on right or left when i could hear it............ just got it back from rand fast turnaround 4 days speaker now works but still not loud enough for an old man in a screaming truck with the window opened acrack to let the smoke out. mp3 or xm up loud etc. found a speaker at pilot that fits.....for telephones. has to have a seperate power source.... i wouldnt advise buy this gps .too many bugs in it.,2,0,1000
A1335QNEHF8AU6,610,I bought the Advent AW770 for pickup at Circuit City as a Christmas gift for my mom.  She installed it for TV listening and discovered that it would not change channels.  After many tuning attempts by herself and with the help of neighbors she called Advent for assistance and they insisted their equipment was not the problem and were rude to her.  She took the unit to Circuit City and they plugged it in and had the same problem.  She called Advent back to talk to a supervisor who was more insulting than the first guy.She now has a Sony MDR RF975RK.,1,0,554

A13910TC3NZ6LE,44,I won a Polaroid PDC 640 Creative Kit in a contest.  Given its current MSRP. I would not have purchased it due to the limited resolution .640 x 480 pixels..  The market is full of digital cameras with better resolution .11.5 megapixels. for about the same price.As ease of use goes. it doesnt get much better than this.  You simply put in the batteries. install the SmartMedia card. turn it on. and start clicking away.  In order to download the pictures youve taken the software must be installed to your computer.  In response to the one reviewer who complained about the software not being compatible with certain editions of Windows. you need merely to go to Polaroidss website and download the patch for Windows 2000 or in my case. Windows XP.  It took only a few minutes to download and I was soon up and running.This camera is fairly intuitive if you have at least a working knowledge of digital cameras.  I found myself only having to review the users manual once. and it is fairly straightforward. The green flash indicator in the viewfinder makes it difficult to frame your shot as one previous reviewer noted. and aside from the limited resolution this is about the only other negative thing I can say about the camera.  Although it interfaces with the computer via serial cable as opposed to the much faster USB. I havent found this to be a major problem.  I downloaded 14 pictures to my PC in only about 23 minutes just the night before writing this review.  Picture quality is fair in the high resolution mode. good in super high resolution mode.  I dont recommend using either the medium or low resolution settings.Lastly. regarding battery life complaints I havent found the PDC 640 to be any worse than any other digital camera.  The kit includes an AC adapter which I highly recommend be used for downloads. which accounts for considerably more battery drain than actual picture taking.  The resolution mode you use will also make a difference .higher resolution = more battery use..If youre looking for an easy to use digital camera the PDC 640 is a very good choice.  If you want the highest quality that digital photography has to offer. look elsewhere...but youll have a slightly more complicated camera.,3,0,2226

A13BI0C1WFYF52,0,I have had my portable DVD for about a year and a half now without one problem. This is a great product if you are a constant traveller as I am. This is also a terrific product if you have to travel with kids. The only  downside of this product is that the little speakers and even when you use  the headphones the volume just is not there. Other than the sound this is a  great product.,4,1,387
A13BWQDECDDVIZ,0,Id never bought one of these. mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores.  I hadnt looked online much. and hadnt really needed a monitor mounting device until recently.This thing is well built. and it does the job.  Its not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor .TV or PC. on the wall this will do the job.  It comes with a nice bag of heavyduty hardware.  It is primarily designed for mounting TV sets. but you can get it to work with a PC monitor. as long as it has the VESA mounting.It mainly articulates sidetoside and inandout.  Itll pivot a bit up and down. but thats limited.,4,1,627
A13C6S5NH2R0UY,3739,First of all. let me say I had a street pilot before. That was fine. the main drawback being that you have to precompute the route and stick to it.This unit does compute the route. recalculate it whenever you decide or have to leave it. No more problem with route too long to store. no more problem of badly pointed turns .like on the other side of the highway etc.. The computed routes might not be the actual fastest or shortest but in my case the most important point is getting where I want without troubles.Dont know how to get there ? It will find it. Huge traffic jam ahead ? Take first exit and let it recompute a new route.Pricey but really really cool. Also comes with everything you need .unlike the regular Street Pilot where you had to buy the map and memory card on the side..A couple of cons and enhancements .for the measure. . * Id like to be able to rate some road. For example to take me back home it keeps on routing thru the I95 where I take the US1 a couple of exists before. * Id like to be able to store the waypoints on the memory card .right now only the maps go there. the wp are stored in the internal memory so you have to plug the unit to the PC for the waypoints and routes..,5,1,1206
A13CAEL27CJZYI,27,As soon as I found out that Nook is based on Android I was sold. I have been working with Android OS since I got MyTouch in 2009.Once I bought Nook Color I immediately installed upgrade 1.2 and rooted it. After that I tried Cyanogen Mod 7 via sdcard that gives you Bluetooth capabilities and then installed overclocked kernel. Most of my aps from my Samsung Captivate work on Nook and I could not be more happier with it. I can start APN on my phone and have wifi anywhere. With BT activated you can use your Nook as huge GPS navigator using Google Maps. So what if it doesnt have a camera? I dont even use nice camera on my phone. With BT you can even make phone calls over SIP or use your phone as a video camera. This is all besides having Laputa for epub. FBReader for FB2 and Amazon Kindle ap. My Docs to Go allows me to read any doc file with ability to bookmark. For right now I returned it to original Nook OS cause my wife likes it. Highly recommend.Oh. Nook color OS is pretty much is bulletproof. You have to be an idiot to brick it.,5,1,1044
A13CYKLK8U4TKO,0,Ive had at least four of these before I bought this one. All five do not work. Years ago. I had some Zip drives that worked for quite awhile. but then they started to not work wellcould be software is not updated. I have a lot of disks with data on them I need to access. I am not going to buy another until I figure out this problem. I will then download all the files to either CD or solid state. I need those files and I will take my disappointment with the Zip drive company to my grave after telling the large number of friends in the same situation as I am. It will not affect the lousy product because no longer make it. But whatever else they make will suffer sales until I get a satisfactory resolution of this problem,1,0,727
A13EYYKYE6PCTM,0,I love my Micro Innovations keyboard.  My company first gave me one with the touchpad in the middle. by the end of the first day using this my shoulder ached.

Ive had tendonitis repeatedly and if I couldnt use this keypad Im sure Id be crippled by now.My only problem is the touchpad stops working. I bang it a couple times and its fine but it seems to be happening more and more now and I cant find another one to replace it.  I would love to know if anyone sells them.,4,1,632

A13FMAPTJG4UBI,22,The Dazzle Digital Video Creator could have been an excellent product. It is in a reasonable price range for those wishing to capture and edit their original productions or home movies. If you would like to put these back on tape so that everyone can watch them. as the box promises. than your out of luck.The instructions included with the unit are vague and dont really touch on the topic of what to do once your done editing and want to record back to tape. Customer support is nonexistent so dont bother calling or emailing. I have been struggling. with no luck. to put my edited videos back on tape for some time.Given the readings I have done on various news groups and discussion rooms. I am not alone in this problem. The box. marketing. and all related advertising clearly promise that you can record back to tape. but you have to guess how. if at all. that is possible. The total lack of customer support. while annoying and inexcusable. is the icing on the cake for this great idea turned into a shoddy product.A definite DONT BUY.,1,0,1042

A13HUHXEQPX3YI,1617,Pros. eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF .both scanned and standard text. and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. Instore help and extra features from Bu0026N. Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity .this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks..Cons. eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. .Also. Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?.Ive played with an iPad and its a very fun device. But what I dont like is a glowing backlit screen. as I look at a monitor all day. When I read. I want to relax and give my eyes a break. and thats why I prefer eInk displays.The Nooks primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books .scanned or text either works. and buy books from various online ebook stores. including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldnt have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software. a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that Bu0026N does not .a very temporary state of affairs. I suspect.. but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature. free library books. and the ability to take it to a Bu0026N store for bonus features. and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the eInk screen. but once you get used to it. the device seems very smooth. In fact. I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax. and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen. reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience. I now prefer it to reading books in print. to be perfectly honest.,5,1,2132

A13JT0DEF2D25K,56,I have found that the SkipDoctor products can help CDDVDs that really need to be resurfaced. but can hurt CDs that only need to be cleaned. Clean your CDDVDs first and see if that helps.kit includes cleaningbuff cloth.. If that does not help. try to repair u0026quotonlyu0026quot the scrathed area of the disc first. not the entire disc.

This product can help if used properly and appropriately. otherwise it can definitely damage discs.,3,0,549
A13JZ1WIEZMJXX,22,Weve had ours for a year. use it daily .in the shower and all over the house.. and it still looks and works like new. We may have replaced the batteries once. Maybe not. I cant remember.Keep in mind that its not designed or sold as a hifi radio. Its not stereo. and the speaker is not large enough to provide a wide frequency response. But for its size and shape. its as loud and clear as it can possibly be.You will never find a better radio for use in the shower. the reception is outstanding. The speaker is clear and loud enough to hear in the shower. The case is attractive and tough. The controls are easy to operate. even with wet hands. How often do you buy a product thats reasonably affordable and absolutely flawless?Update 11708. My wife still wont just leave this radio in the shower. to my occasional chagrin. She carries it around the house to listen to NPR while she works on stuff and I can never find it when I want it. Today she dropped it on our hardwood floor. The battery door popped off. and and the batteries spilled out. She put them back in and NPR was again heard from the radio. Why havent you bought one of these yet?Update 8312010. Still going strong. This radio is no longer available. but theICFS79Wseems to be an able replacement. What a workhorse this radio has been!,5,1,1301
A13KMFCVVSHO0B,1922,Not a good product if you plan on using the timer when running.  This product wants you to be either in timing mode or radio mode. You CAN listen to the radio while the timer is on. but if you want to change the tuner.  volume. etc... you must stop your watch .. Not very practical and poor  planning on Kosss part. If you just want to use the radio then the product  is fine.,1,0,376

A13KTNVB5IG8SB,22,Defective unit. scan function worked 1 out of 30. Battery trays are very poorly made. The eight battery compartment would not power the unit. If the unit was working as designed I would have great concern for the longevity of the battery holders. As they were not straight in the compartments with slight alignment issues. Audio was acceptable and it did bring in the NOAA clearly.,1,0,381

A13M0YEMOZZKDL,22,I have been using one of these for a few years and just bought another one for my brother. Its more of a theft deterrent than a theft prevention product.

A13N4U3EUHYDZP,0,Weve tried a few shower radios and most did not stick well to the shower wall. This radio gives the option of hanging by short string or just sitting flat on a surface.

A13O1SBU4VHZI8,3031,Recently bought this camera. and although im very happy with it. there are a few remarks id like to make.  Im not getting exactly what i see on the lcd screen. that is. at the moment i press the button the image i get  is different from the one i see on the lcd. This is due to some kind of  auto correction the camera does by itself and cannot be turned off. If you  buy this camera remember to buy at least two packs of rechargeable nimh  .this is of extreme importance .for normal ones wont last 20 min.. you  should also get the ac adaptor for downloading pics. Also keep in mind the  download is through a serial port. this is aprox 115000 bps. this means  its really slow .it can take up to 25 secs per image on fine mode.. I  dont know how good are those USB flash card readers. but im thinking  seriously about buying one. But I have to say the quality of the images is  impecable. i love it. even in jpg. they are just great!,4,1,934
A13PMYKJMG1LI4,33,I recentely bought one of this. and Im very satisfied with the product and its amazing talking properties. Its very simple to install. you can  do it by yourself. and works well. I desagree to the opinion of the please  help me lady. It only says this phrase if its tempted. and you can adjust  the sensor. so it do not occour false alarm. And the voice is intercallated  by a siren. so you dont think its really a woman crying. Her neighbor  must adjust better his alarm sensor. Mine is ok. The alarm can be activated  with or without voices. Its doing a lot of success in my town. THE BEST  VALUE!,5,1,599

A13U99STLDHMXU,33,Waste of time and money. I ordered a Garmin Nuvi 1490 charger. But I received a Motorola RAZR cellphone charger. along with an invoice that stated I received 1 Motorola RAZR charger and 1 Garmin Nuvi 1490 charger. Wait. there was only one item in the box! The charger that I received made the new GPS reboot constantly. so we stopped using it immediately  sadly. the incompatible charger was part of a larger gift that included the aforementioned GPS and we didnt want this bogus charger to break the new toy. No one should have to order a product that is plainly listed as one thing. get something else entirely. and then have to spend time either checking that the two are compatible or filing a complaint. Looks like I was not alone  and Amazon recommended this accessory! Wow! How about that? But if you want to be that guy. this is the Garmin charger for you!,1,0,864
A13UV3HMJ9295J,33,This radio is just what we were looking for. I do agree with some of the other reviews .that I read before I purchased.. If you are looking to get some range out of the signal an external antenna will be necessary. While traveling with this unit the truckers keep us informed on the weather. traffic. late at night keep us awake. Awsome radio.,5,1,343

A13V10PL0AZRAO,22,Good sound  though better sound quality outdoors for sure.  Plugged it in and it worked right away with my current Advent transmitter from indoor wireless speakers.

A13W786BWHV1EW,910,The sound is great. its very attractive. a perfect size. easy to read and the batteries last a very long time. However one thing that isnt good. and I dont know if anyone else has had this  a few of the tops of the push buttons have peeled off. Right now the off button has no top. so theres a hole with the mechanics of that button showing. Prior to today. in order to turn it off. I would push inside the button. However. now that has ceased to work and the only way to turn it off is to remove the batteries. Someone had mentioned to me that the tops should be glossed with colorless nail polish but this suggestion was made to me AFTER the tops came off. I dont think that I was overly harsh with this  just normal use so I really dont understand why this should have happened.  This is more of a cosmetic problem than performance.  I will say that even with this. I intend to buy the radio again because of any small radio Ive had. this is by far so superior in looks and sound and design. Maybe Sony has made improvements to this  I cant believe Im the only one to whom this has happened. Its lasted a very long time  maybe 10 years or so. Although Id rather not have to spend money for another radio. all in all. its really worth it. We dont keep it in the shower. but on a shelf away from water. Maybe thats why its lasted so long.  Next one I get I think Ill try the nail polish trick and see if that helps.,4,1,1416
A13WREJ05GMRA6,0,Fast Ethernet cable built to last.  Bought this as an extra cable in case I needed it.  Works like a charm and is a great asset to have.  You can never have too many cables.,3,0,173
A13Z3US6I8IOS9,1922,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE AN iBOOK!!  It slides in easily. but it is almost impossible to get out.  I had to call their support line and they told me to apply pressure in the upper left corner .lower right corner if the lock is upside down..  Even after doing that. it took me 10 minutes before I finally got it out.  When I called. the guy asked me if I had an ibook before anything else.  He then told me that they are tight in the ibooks and people have trouble getting them out.  It is not worth the struggle if you have an ibook.  I highly do not recommend this product for apple ibooks.,1,0,589

A13ZT5G31M5WJ5,1,UPDATEOK. I received a replacement radio from Midland.It took about 2 weeks for the replacement to arrive. It came in a small brown box. not the retail package that I sent it in. All the parts were piled in the box with packing peanuts. The radio and accessories were all fine. not beat up or scratched. I guess it didnt look expensive enough for UPS to bother trying to smash to pieces. The only thing wrong was the wrist strap was not in the box. I probably wouldnt have used it anyway. I put some rechargeable batteries in the battery holder and turned the radio on....and I was receiving skip. so the problem was fixed with what is probably a .refurbished. radio. Looks new though and it works. I should not have had to pay shipping to have a defective radio replaced but thats life. I like the radio!Received the radio and placed the batteries in the battery holder and turned the unit on. Did not receive any CB signals but not too suprised with the flexible antenna. Checked out the weather channels and received them fine. Took the radio out to the truck and installed the vehicle adapter and connected the radio to a Wilson 1000 antenna and flipped through all 40 CB channels....nothing but background hiss. I backed the squelch all the way off and got the same result. Connected the Cobra 75WXST back to the antenna and received skip on almost all channels. Reconnected the 75822. checked the SWR. all channels below 2. still no CB reception. Packed the radio back in the box. called Midland. sent radio to Midland and now I will wait for a few weeks and think about the extra USD10.00 it cost to own this radio due to shipping to Midland. Customer service at Midland was pleasant and spoke english. I could have sent the radio back to abetterwaytobuy but the turn around time from Midland seems to be shorter than the long wait I had the first time from abetterwaytobuy. Also I think that Midland will probably be sure that I get a working unit when they send one back. So. I cant comment much on the radio itself as far as performance but will update this once I get the radio returned.,4,1,2098

A141IX03H7SGBH,4343,I bought this player 4 months ago when it was first released from Japan while on a trip to Asia. I did extensive researches prior to buying this player and I bought it for its value for money. performance. picturesound  quality and ease of use.Now. Im not a serious audiophille or do I  intend to spend huge amount of dollars to get those top of the range DVD  player .ie. Onkyo. Yamaha. etc.. I want something practical. which I  believe most of you do as well. And guess what?  Surprise. surprise  Ive  got so much more than what I bargained for.The picture is superb.  sharp and crisp on my 30 inch Loewe TV. Colour is bright and does not  u0026quotbleedu0026quot. Sound is excellent when connected to my Yamaha 795a and  no audiosync problems. In addition. the zoom function. builtin DD5.1.  DTS.sounds better than DD!. and HDCD.remarkable audio quality. encoders.  componentcolourstream and Svideo output. dual disc trays and virtual N22  surround sound for those with a 2 speaker setup system made this unit  complete with features. Mine has got two additional mic inputs for Karaoke  and its gold in colour but are of the same parts and build. Its easy to  setup and use as well. Having said this. find me a DVD player that is close  in comparison in regards to price. performance and function.About  compability issues  ZIPPO! Now. do bear in mind that my DVD is Region 5.  and although it has been multizoned. it played Saving Private Ryan .DTS   Region 1.. Haunting. US Marshalls. Deep Blue Sea .all DD  Reg 1..Matrix.  Mummy. Fifth Element. Tomorrow Never Dies.DD  Reg 4.. T2. True Lies .DD   Reg 5. flawlessly without any lockups. freezes. pauses .except for  changing layers for duallayered discs. or audiosync problems.I  guess it is unfortunate that some reviewers have problems with this player.  Maybe you should examine your connections properly and call up Toshiba for  assistance before jumping the gun about this unit?  I have 2 other  relatives who bought this unit from here .Reg 4. upon my recommedation and  they too did not have any problems with it.Maybe I do agree with some  reviewers that the remote is chunky but it serves its purpose very well.  Besides. who buys a unit .VCR. amp. tv for that matter. for its remote  anyway?  Get a Universal remote and that should solve the problem.In  conclusion. I would say this is an awesome purchase. Its definitely worth  every dollar spent on it. Have a read in those DVD magazines and youll  find the SD3109 unit get very good ratings and reviews from professional  audiophilles. I would suggest you visit your local electrical outlet to see  it for yourself. Get it. you wont regret it!Hope my contribution  helps.,5,1,2690

A145G6U4JERNNI,0,As a Kate Spade fan. I was excited to own the Jane Street by Kate Spade cover for my Nook.  I loved the bright pink exterior with orange interior. However. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the product.  Despite the Kate Spade connection. the cover was not leather .it felt more like plastic.  and it was too bulky not allowing it to slip into the tight space in my purse.  Overall. the quality of the product is not worthy of the Kate Spade name which should connote quality.  I exchanged the product for a Nookbrand case  with genuine fine leather and stitching for 50% less.....,1,0,594

I was immediately drawn to it for it  rich feature set .e.g. component video outputs. coaxial and optical  digital audio outputs.. within it price point. Over the months. though.  Ive havent had any of the problems such as lockups and pixellation that  some of the other reviewers have had. and I continue to be pleased with the  units highquality image. outstanding sound. and overall highquality feel.  Given an unlimited budget. the highend .USD1.000 +. Sony model would have  been my choice. but for the money. I feel the Panasonic is one of the best  players available.,4,1,750

A14B02OBDNYL5P,44,I had initially purchased Pioneer DV525 which is also a nicemodel in the sub USD300 range. However I switched to A120 because Ineeded a DVD player which could switch u0026quotblack levelu0026quot. DV525 doesnt have that option. Also 525 is noisy compared to the A120. I have played over 30 Dolby Digital 5.1 DVDs .mostly rented.and did not find a single glitch either in picture or audio. There was no lip sync problem either. The picture quality is great .I have a Sony WEGA. which also makes a difference!.. As far as audio is concerned. it plays regular audio CD perfectly .almost.. However compared to 525. it is slightly behind in u0026quotcrispnessu0026quot of the sound. I have the player hooked to a Yamaha Dolby Digital receiver via an optical cable .Monster.and the SVideo goes straight into the WEGA. The disc loading time is also very small which is nice.You dont have to wait for ages to get the disc loaded. One aspect of A120 which I did not like is that you cannot change the audiovideo settings while you are playing the disc. The Pioneer DV525 does let you change picture modes and audio settings while the disc is being played. Also. I wish the A120 had an amber display instead of white. Oveall an excellent buy for sub USD200 price. I dont think any other player would come even close to this ! If you can get it for even sub USD230. BUY IT.,5,1,1362

A14HELMEIPIVNU,22,Easy to use. bright screen and since its capacity can be expanded up to 32 gb by adding a micro sd card I think it is better than a Kindle. With this ability you are practically able to carry a library worth thousands of books. Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website. I have also purchased a CaseCrown Regal Flip Case from Amazon at a bargain price. It fits the Nook very well and is also a beautifull case.I am thinking to buy more of them in combos as presents to my other family members.,5,1,602

A14IL4PJ2CA96F,1216,My husband has been getting gifts from me for 15 years and finally I got him something he really liked.  He has marked several fishing spots with it and everyone he takes fishing with him to these marked spots is very  impressed with his GPS.  Ive used it to go for walks and monitor distance.  It is a unique. affordable. and user friendly piece of equipment.,5,1,360
A14J537H58XBYV,12,Now that it is installed it is fine.  But installation was a pain.  Unlike other similar low priced mounts. this does not have a separate plate that you mount to the TV then mount to the bracket.  You have to hold the TV up in position. align with bracket holes and start screws.  Try that on ladders 6 feet in the air.  with a 40 or 50 pound TV.  I bought some screws of proper size. cut off the head and used 2 as locating guides to get screw holes aligned.  Started 2 screws then replace my starter studs with screws. Made it easier but NOT easy.  Also adjustment is very difficult with TV installed.  Weight of TV binds the adjusting bracket when you loosen set screw.  I would NOT recommend this mount there are better choices.  I got an OMNIBasics OBFM60 mount for a similar price . on clearance. and it was 5 STARS compared to this.,1,0,839
A14LDYJ9KHAR5W,861,I am very disappointed with this product.  I travel 75 highway miles a day and have passed numerous police vehicles who were obviously using radar.

A14LIGEXV4B2BS,0,Good as described. Works flawlessly. Fast shipping as well. The little red button doesnt work due to unavailable logitech drivers for this mouse in windows 7. Hopefully someone out there can come up with a suitable driver to get this little red button to work.Note. The seller should have clean up the mouse before shipping it out. It was dirty as hell. Sellers should be responsible to keep their products nice and clean even for used items.,4,1,442

A14OCIQKBW4XO3,3535,I purchased this cable a few weeks ago to replace my bidirectional cable for my HP Deskjet 697C.  While I agree that the packaging was poor and left much untold.  What I found was a product which I was more than satisfied with.  Like the others. I am a Computer Tech.  A System Administrator to be  exact.  I was having communication problems with my printer since purchase.  Sometimes the bidirectional communications would worksometimes not.  Print jobs would hang after a couple of pages.  This cable has resolved  that problem.  After reading these reviews. I would like to make mention  that the packaging does not guarentee complete compatibility.  Remember.  this cable is designed to merge two types of communication which were NOT  meant to be used on the same peripheral.  USB is actually a networking  technology.  When your printer is connected using this cable. it is seen as  a networked printer.  If they are not designed to be a network printer.  then the limitation is with your printer.  And. the bidirectional  technology in HP products only serves to provide feedback to the computer  like paper outages.  The printer works just fine without the bidirectional  capability.  Though it was a little depressing to find this. it isnt the  cables fault.  It is just the limitations you get when mixing two types of  communication technologies.  Overall. I am more than satisfied with the  product.  Just be smart and do the research before buying and buy from  someone who has a return policy if it isnt compatible with your particular  printer.,4,1,1560
A14ODY5TCYOXCT,11,First. the good part. These are the second set of Jensen headphones Ive purchased. Theyre a very good value compared to some of the others Ive tried. The downside is that the signal will very slowly drift over the life of the batteries. but usually a slight tap of the tuning knob will bring it back. The newer models like this one appear to have better signal aquisition. so this may solve some of the drift problems I saw in older models. Battery life is pretty good. I usually went through a set every 67 days on the old one. .The old model required 3 AAAs instead of 2 however.Now the bad. The production values are rather poor on the electronics in these headphones. My first pair started going rather glitchy on me. sometimes Id have to lightly hit the side to get them to find the signal again. and the battery life started going down drastically. It also would rapidly lose signal when it had this problem. I took them apart and noticed that the soldering job was quite substandard. and there were several uninsulated speaker wires that were shorting out. After putting some insulation in on the board. the headphones started working perfectly. I took these apart after I recieved them and noticed the same problem. The headphone was also popped loose from its plastic fitting due to substandard glue. Both easily fixable if youre good with electronics.,4,1,1361

A14PTJ17T1GTCE,79,Actually. before i go into the review. let me comment on some of the previous reviews.To u0026quotAn Electronics Fan.u0026quot What Leslie is talking about is not the voice over IP delay. Read her review more carefully it says that the person she is talking to can hear herself. That means Leslies friend is talking. the sound is going to Leslies earpiece. and then the sound coming out of Leslies Earpiece is being picked up through her microphone.To u0026quotLeslie.u0026quot Mine doesnt have that problem. Perhaps you should contact Labtec. because it may be a problem with your unit.As for MY unit. I love it. Besides the fact that it makes me feel like one of those people in ATu0026ampT commercials. the mic picks up what you want to hear and filters out what you dont pretty well. Ive actually used this mic for a quick recording session with me and my guitar. and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. So if youre interested in recording. this could possibly hold you over for quite some time.I also like the ability for the mic to rotate 360 degrees. allowing you to wear the headset any way you please .mic on left OR mic on right.. It gives you a lot more flexibility if youre like me and dont have a lot of space to adjust your body around dangling cords and such.So if youre looking for an inexpensive microphoneheadset. I wholeheartedly recommend the Labtec.,5,1,1379
A14PTJ17T1GTCE,44,You can probably get a floppy drive elsewhere or of a different make. but at least with the TEAC here. youre not going to run into any problems. In my experience. Ive never had a problem with my TEAC drives .and I can actually say that some of my other drives HAVE died on me..Get it for peace of mind.,4,1,302
A14PXT6XGUO0C0,1,I bought this item on accident thinking it was the tablet. I had to return it and had to pay for the shipping and was not reimbursed the full amount.

A14QFQFF3ZX575,210,I need to buy a gift for my mothers birthday and I know she likes to read books while on break at her job. I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her. after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook. I learned a number of things.1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card. even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root .hack. the Nook and thus enable a functional browser. it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldnt have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isnt very computer savvy. and doesnt own a credit card. so I couldnt give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free. it would be an ideal ereader. In its current form. its an overlycomplicated money sinkhole. Now Im out USD70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I dont know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have. is a really despicable thing to do.If you dont mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card. and throwing money at it to read books. then the Barnes u0026 Noble Nook is right for you. If you are looking for an easy to use Ereader for library ebooks. STAY AWAY!,1,0,1553

A14RIB0E0SSHNO,45,I bought these to replace my Sony foldable headphones .MDRA106. because the foam had completely fallen apart on my Sony pair. The sound with these headphones was absolutely terrible. No bass and it sounded like I was listening to my music in a tin can. So I took off the foam and put it around my Sonys right after and the Sony pair put these Maxwells to absolute shame. Dont buy this.,1,0,385
A14TAG3WH240NF,25,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!  I am on my third Glowlight since January. The product has serious software problems KNOWN to Bu0026N. Within a week after receiving the third unit .second replacement. it began to fail. The pages would only turn backwards. sometimes not change either forward or backwards. The reader would not shut off. the screen would blank out. I can use it sometimes if it is plugged in but not for long! There is no Glowlight anymore. It is unconscionable to me that Bu0026N would continue to market this product. Unfortunately. I am stuck with the product since I have several hundred dollars invested in Nook books. Be forewarned. Nearly all of my purchased books were obtained for my Nook Simple .which had no problems.. I had loaned it to a friend take a look at but will take back for my own use,1,0,816

A14U83FD0VOYB7,0,The Good. This is a sturdy. relatively low priced tablet built around reading.The Bad. Its a little slow. What really surprised me. though. is that Barnes and Noble charges for Public Domain books that are free on Kindle .or pretty much any other device.. I got this tablet for my little brother in part because I wanted him to have access to all the great books that Kindle offers for free. not expecting that Bu0026N would charge for them. It also seems as though prices might be slightly higher for Nook than Kindle.,3,0,519

A14UZX840TBC0D,0,I purchased this because I knew I was going to be on an international flight. and I know how they like to shut the fans off during take off.

A14V6R6CC8DZJ6,11,I bought this product recently and I must say for the price. it is fantastic. It reads my music CDs and other CD type disks. but for some reason I cannot play a DVD on it.

A14VA3FF8VBZV0,33,I had been looking for a good pair of headphones for a reasonable price for a long time when I happened to try these headphones in a CD shop.  .The shop was using them to allow customers to listen to used CDs before buying..I have tried every conceivable type of headphones costing less than USD20 around. the Sony stickinyourear style. the original Walkman style. the ear bud style. the Panasonic cliptotheear. etc.  There is something wrong with the sound quality for each of those types.These headphones only cost a little more. but the quality is much better.  I believe that this is due to two factors. the neodymium magnets. resulting in better bass and treble. and the behindthehead style which keeps the speakers closer to your ears. allowing you to hear all the sound.There is one disadvantage to these headphones for me. I wear glasses. and the headphones pinch my ears against the eyeglass frames.  To get around this I just sit the eyeglass earpieces on top of the speakers.Im not associated in any way with EarHugger. Amazon. or anybody else that has anything to do with these headphones.  Im just an ordinary customer.,5,1,1132
A14VM3EAP9RNC6,918,The major limiting factor to an MP3 player is that it. well. has to run MP3s.  The problem with this is that the MP3 is a compressed sound format.  That is. even if you are recording from your CDs to MP3s. you are losing  sound quality. which is very noticable on choral or vocalintense songs.  If what you are looking for is something to listen to while you jog or  rollerblade. this product is for you.  However. if you want to read a book  while listening or just listen to music without distractions. the sound  difference is easy to hear.  The technology has come a long way. but the  MP3 will never be able to rival CD quality sound.,3,0,639

A14X0KX1YPQF1S,37,I have recently bought the Diamond Rio PMP300 player and it was a complete dissapointment right fromt he getgo. As soon as I got home. I was so excited to put my MP3s on to it and begin to listen to it. WRONG!  If you  dont have a computer that was made yesterday. it wont work.  My computer  was made in 96 and already it is too old to support the software. I had to  call Rio and wait 20 mins for a operator who as soon as I talked to him.  said my computer was hopeless and the only way it might work was to go and  download all of this information and purchase new parallel port adaptors.  NO WAY!  no where on the box did it say this. I have finally gotten it to  work. but it is skipping like crazy. something is wrong with it and this  sucker is going back to the store. Its a complete flop. and NO ONE should  buy it. It only has 32MB memory. and the cards cost a fortune. it is always  running. so the battery slowly wears down. I love the earbuds. and the size  and wieght. thats why there are 2 stars. No other reason. Overall. this  product stinks!,2,0,1060

A14YRSRBAWO9UK,25,I would like to have known this product could only be used if you have a WiFi connection to set it up. There is nothing on the box which states this need and you do not find this out until you get home and the Christmas present will not work without it. I understand you should do some research on products before you buy them but reading the users guide may be a stretch. I am now stuck with a USD100 paperweight until I get to a WiFi connection.Books cannot be transferred except by WiFi. save yourself the hassle and buy the Kindle. Much more user friendly and easier to usedownload books transfer books. Thought to give Barnes and Noble a try. wont do that again will be returning the Nook for a Kindle.,2,0,707

A153QEMFRDWKWM,99,do not waste your time or money on this peice of crap gamepad. it looks alright for its price. but when it is actually being used it will act as if you pressed a button that you havent pressed . and the Dpad seems to stick on the left. which results in no action whatsoever when you press the  right button and it will cause your character to turn or move to the left  when you arent pressing anything....I thought it was just a defective pad.  so I took it back and tried another one. it did the same thing. so I took  the new one back and shelled out an extra USDs and bought a Microsoft  Sidewinder Gamepad. I have been happy ever since....... The moral of this  review. dont buy the PC Propad 6 there are much better controllers on  the market. if you are a serious gamer wanting results I recommend the  Microsoft Sidewinder Gamepad.it is a little more expensive but you get a  lot more for the buck!,1,0,905

A155OVWKZ310I,8990,Its a shame they dont show pictures of the inside of this bag.  The top opens up and then the front zips down to reveal 3 mesh pockets meant for flashcards. floppy disks. and cables.  Actually. I use mine for a camerabinocular set I was given.  The pointandshoot camera and compact binoculars fit in the main compartment easily together with the divider.  The mesh pockets dont hold bulky items. but its good enough for a roll of file and a simple camera cleaning kit.  So I have the basics ready for travel in one small bag.I even bought another one for a personal 2u0026quot TV.  The TV and its AC adapter are in the main compartment with a small pair of headphones in the front.  I initially wanted to get this bag for my digital camera and accessories.  But with a camera. battery charger. AC adapter. and three cables. it was just too much to fit inside this bag I got a small camcorder bag instead.So this camera bag is great. but dont expect the pockets up front to hold much.,4,1,983
A155WK4J425WSQ,1013,I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device. especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.Ive had the Nook .3 of them. actually. and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First. the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen. but Id rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They dont seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second. and most importantly. is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page. within words. and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files. or formatting. so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. Its just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem. Im going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. Its too bad I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note. I put this review on the Bu0026N site. and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well. okay then.,1,0,1204

A15C7PFILHQNNO,88,I have been using one of these for about six months and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive solution that allows carrying around of a Palm III.This is not a perfect item it took me a couple of weeks to get used to pulling the Palm out of it. I suppose it is possible to push it up from the bottom of the case. but I just felt more comfortable grabbing it from the top.The initial fit was a little tight. but not seriously so. and the case soon loosened up just enough that slipping the Palm in and out of it became quite easy. I have never had a problem leaving the fliptop case of the Palm itself attached.In my experience. this may not be the best solution. but it is cheaper than many and. with a little care. holds up well under use. The only significant problem I have found is that it has a slight tendency to slip off of a pant waist with a belt. however. the loop in the clasp has always kept it firmly attached. Obviously. this case was designed for use with a belt. rather than not.Also. there may be initial problems with the inside lip of the case tending to catch and fold inward while inserting a Palm this is unfortunate. but is easily overcome with practice.,4,1,1197
A15DIP9QPUR6IR,0,could not get my Acer netbook to accept this device.returned it .Eventually got a true plug and play LG  onehad much more luck,1,0,126
A15EX94H522EAF,11,I must have gotten a bad one. It will not pick up stations as easily as my other analog radios so i dont quite understand how the other reviewers are giving it such high marks. I have a feeling the older models were much better probably a different mfr. The sound is decent when it does but i could have spent and have spent much less for a better radio. I travel alot and most hotel alarm clock radios have better reception. One of my coworkers has one in his office and he must have gotten a bad one too.,1,0,506
A15FPN5N8TI3Q8,0,This is probably a good mount for lighter. smaller TVs. I just didnt trust the weight rating it noted.  My LCD is 60 lbs. and I didnt even finish unboxing this before I starting searching for another one.  Very thin. light metal that ended up costing me USD11 in return shipping.  Spend a few bucks more and get a heavier mount like http.www.amazon.comgpproductB001TICH08ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_1,3,0,398

A15HK2IMO8K6V1,1,One recharged battery only lasts for 12 continous hours of use. Now I understand why they have provided 4 batteries in a pack. However for the price that I paid. it is really worth it. I have been reusing the batteries for approximately 2 mos. now.,3,0,248
A15HNVJRCUBGGJ,33,I really liked the radio but in my new office I get poor reception because of our wireless network.,4,0,99
A15HNVJRCUBGGJ,0,I bought this radio for my desk at work. I have not had a single problem. It picks up every station I have looked for. I listen to am radio more than fm and it is clear on the three stations I listen to. I hooked up a pair of computer speakers I had and it allows me to have the radio on the far side of my desk and control the volume by the speaker. Great value!,5,1,363
A15IA5FZBO3JIK,0,Ive had mine for 2 years or more. Its been great but the software hasnt worked for over 2 years.  Theres some great freeware stuff you can download that works well and even some Linux loaders for it.  The company is worthless. no help. no support. etc.  While trying to upload the firmware upgrade mine died and I havent been able to recover it. No help from the manufacturer and of course the warranty is well past  Its a shame such a good product has such terrible support.,1,0,475
A15IMQGPO3BWY8,0,Heres a tip for all the gamers who are missing the full size arrow keys. leave your fingers on the home keys the way God intended and configure those keys within the game for movement.  Its a much more natural possition. and it allows your hand access to the optimal number of keys for other functions in the game.Arrow keys are almost obsolete with a scrolling mouse. and I dont miss the big space hogs at all.  This is a good product overall. but I dock it one star for a mushy space bar.,4,1,490

A15J2BVVOIFCPI,33,Even though I didnt realize that my mPCIe port was internally hooked up to a SATA2 port .rather than a PCIe bus as the name would seem to imply. until after I installed it. this part is still plenty fast.  I use it to boot Windows 7 into Windows Media Player for my HTPC. on an Intel DH77DFi33225 platform. and it takes mere seconds.  If I ever upgrade this HTPC to a platform that actually does SATA3. Id expect an even faster experience. as this part is basically a Samsung 840 Pro.  And yes. I know I can buy an adapter that lets me use this with one of the internal SATA3 ports on the motherboard. but I opted for a robust. clean install that minimized the installation footprint.,4,1,684
A15JV1H0CPTE40,0,It does what it was made to do. nothing spectacular.I should have probably opted for the 32gb instead because of the Su0026H charge.,4,1,132
A15K7R0AF49BZT,9292,I recently purchased an Olympus digital camera and  took the suggestion from one of the reviews and purchased a floppy adapter. Im very happy with it! It makes downloading pictures much easier. and can also be used as a  general purpose. large floppy disk. In fact. I use it much more to transfer  files between PCs than as a camera accessory.My recommendation is to buy  one. but NOT this one!  Again from one of the Olympus reviews. I found the  real manufacturer of these adaptersa company called SmartDisk. You get the same thing for USD20 less. plus if you use  SmartMedia cards. you get an 8MB card included free .at least as of 220  stated as a u0026quotLimited Time Offeru0026quot.. I suggest you check it out!,5,1,718
A15KCEKCUCYF0O,3,The price of this tablet I do love.Thats about it.First of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheap.Almost the whole shell of the nook is plastic.Since also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to push.The format of the homepage I do not like.If you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and video.You do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limited.Whats also very limited is the app store.What a joke.The apps are all very boring and overpriced.The book are usually never free.The only Up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junk.Either save up your money for an ipad or or kindle fire.I will be returing my nook!!!!,2,0,796

A15NRW2WONPHI8,11,Please read all the reviews on this item and do not buy unless you want a mountain of headaches after.This gadget is so cheap I would estimate it has about .75 in materials at most and .10 in labor.Its made somewhere in Asia and sold by Targus in the U.S.There is another product thats exactly the same with just a shorter cable and has exactly the same crap materials and labor.The main points of interest is the problem is with the locking combination that locks you out after you change it. Thats actually not that big a problem because this item is so cheap I guarantee you the lock part will come off with the slightest tug .so much for security..Go to Staples or another reputable Office Supply store and get a GOOD LOCK and avoid this thing at all costs.,1,0,761
A15OAYKEGZ9LNB,1518,While reading the description of this item. I came to the conclusion that this was a bandpass subwoofer.  I even called my friend to describe it to him and he had the same one. or so I thought.  When I got the product. the  picutre on the side of the box had legs on the bottom...meaning that is was  a downfiring subwoofer.  This was completely different from what I had in  mind.  No where in the description did it have anything about a  downfiring subwoofer. nor did the pictures show any legs on the unit to  indicate this.Please be more precise in the descriptions.  Thank  you for your prompt service,3,0,607
A15PCZV9BTLIYK,11,Fortunately. the price didnt break the bank. but this is NOT a data cable as the product name says.  It can be used to charge the LG 420G. but not to transfer data.

A15U5NUS1EY7IQ,23,Im getting listening stations going in several elementary classrooms. These have proved reliable. kidproof  and they are reasonably priced. They do limit quantities on some of these which is why Im getting more than one brand. All the brands Ive gotten have worked.,5,1,265
A15U64MFY78K6P,0,I found this product to be exactly what I wanted and all two chargers work perfectly. my only issue was that there is only one interchangeable cable.,4,1,149
A15UFRMS87SIEI,22,Overall the RCA VH920 Video Switcher works well for general video switching.  Id expect this until to be a good seller as its reasonably simple to operate and inexpensive with 6 ports.  Both audio and video are acceptable. and the programming directions are conveniently silk screened on the bottom.As already mentioned. the big downfall is it loses your programmed in remote codes upon power failure.  Also. programming the device codes takes a bit to figure out.  I did eventually program every device .including DiSH. Panasonic DVD player. TiVo. Panasonic StereoAmp. Sony VCR. on any remote key I choose.  I had some initial problems until I realized it usually accepted them if I continued to depress the remote key for 4 seconds or so during programming.  Plus. this way I can activate any device without activating the VH920 Video Selector by depressing the remote key only long enough to activate the device .usually about 1 second..  Or activate the device and the VH920 Video Selector if I depress longer .usually about 4 seconds..  Just wish I didnt have to reenter remote codes on power failure.,4,1,1106
A15UZOKTY80AJF,2025,I am a more experienced photographer and needed to find a good a megapixel camera for Internet work. This model Olympus gave sharp pictures with good print .8x10. quality on my Epsom 740 printer. Alkaline batteries do not  last every long especially if you use the LCD often. The software worked  well to transfer the images into my PC. The only reason I am still looking  is that I needed a camera that had manual settings like the Nikon Cool Pix.  so I could set the focus rather than being restricted to auto focus.  Olympus is known for their better quality lenses. a good reason to consider  this camera.,4,1,609
A15UZOKTY80AJF,33,I use these batteries with my digital camera and find them very reliable When the batteries are exhausted .used in my Nikon Coolpix 950. the charge takes about 4 to 6 hours to bring them back to 1.35V.Digital cameras  will exhaust alkaline batteries and the use of the camera becomes too  expensive if used allot. therefore the use of rechargeable bateries.  .cheaper and best for the enviornment.Now I am using these batteries in  my flash but not my camera since they discarge faster then alkaline  batteries and I always need reliable batteries in my camera.,5,1,561

My son cant use it and I have wasted 3 rolls of film trying to work on this. NOT HAPPY!,1,0,344
A15WPUCV9OZXMS,12,This surge protector design works wonderfully with my classic HP 110+ laptop computer. ThinkJet printer and HP 9114B disk drive.  All these devices require a 110 to milliamp cord adapter.  The neat layout of the Smartsockets on the Kensington surge protector permits the side by side plug in of the HP adapter plugs.  Goodbye to the old linear surge protectors that restricted the number of adapters that could be powered.  I love the 16 foot cord that allows me great freedom to locate conveniently my classic computer system wherever I choose.Thank you. Kensington.  DOS commands still LIVE.  I love my classic HP system.,5,1,623

A165JF56RX2G8G,22,These phone jacks are great! You can put them anywhere in the home with just a basic pug in. no installation. The cost was just under USD40. My cable company charged over USD10 more than that to come out to install 1 jack. Not to mention I would have to be available at the times that they gave me. With this there was no wait other than the wait time to receive it in the mail. They are great!,5,1,394

A166MY7C92U957,34,These really suck as a cable tie if you are constantly using them or expect them to hold cables being moved a lot .Ex. Work Travel.. Only the very end of the cable tie has velcro on it. there is no way to attach the wrapped under end to the cable. thus it constantly slips out of its wrap. I took a chance on these to replace my monoprice hook and loop ties and regret it. Dont make the same mistake.Do no buy these. Go with Monoprices hook and loop cable ties. They are a lot better quality and firmly grasp the cable and have velcro along the entire strap.B003L14YQQ,1,0,568

A16D8SHICGQLDC,0,I purchased this handheld CB for a trip from Florida to New Jersey and it came in handy.  The portability was nice and so was the price.  I would recommend purchasing a portable antenna for the car if you want a much  better signal.  This is a must if you are going on a long trip.  I was  especially pleased when we encountered an accident along 95 and we knew  what the situation was.  The truckers really alert you to all the highway  patrol in all the states.  Better than a radar!,4,1,485
A16DISUEZB83W6,77,This tripod is too short .I virtually always use it extended to full height. including the head.. too flimsy .it struggles to hold my Canon 400D still. even with a small lens.. and difficult to adjust .the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle..

A16FK39DKYY5GZ,11,I would rate this a 4 out of 5.Ive been very pleased with the sturdiness of the unit and its ability to pick up radio and TV stations despite just having a thin wire antenna. Weather stations are nonexistent. but Ive yet to find a weather band radio that actually brings in the weather broadcasts without a lot of waving of the antenna and dancing around. I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because its a water RESISTANT. not water PROOF. It seems to me that if a company is going to sell a radio for use in the shower. they should take the extra engineering step of sealing it up so it can be used in the water. Still. with some careful placement. this seems to be a good radio that should provide plenty of entertainment for the money.,4,1,730
A16FLRBMOE2JL3,12,Even though this is the standard style of labels. the labels are heat and water proof because they are laminated.

A16GS0KNO4SFUQ,1011,Okay. Im a cheap Charlie and I tried to save a buck by purchasing an offbrand wall charger instead of the official Garmin factory AC charger.  I gambled and I lost.The charger arrived in a timely manner and I plugged it into my nuvi 765t.  Once plugged in. the display screen emulated the screen viewed when the usb cable is connected to a computer.  Okay. not a problem and could be normal for all I know. but what was unusual was that the GPS unit seemed to boot and reboot. over and over again.  A green loading bar. which I had never previously noted. was displayed and moved from left to right indicating the GPS was apparently booting up.  The problem is that once it booted. it rebooted. and rebooted in an ongoing cycle.  I disconnected the charger before something serious happened  like a permenant crash of my GPS.Im out about Thirteen bucks with shipping. not a tradgedy for me. but caveat emptor.,1,0,909
A16HN3GFLXX7JI,0,The seller was great on getting back to me on the product problems. but could offer no help due to the 30 day policy.This is the second Maxell tape I have purchased and both worked once and then stopped cleaning.

A16HUZR41EWLNF,514,uh oh.  I fell for the hype.  I thought that this device was comparable to the Kindle Fire and it is just a simple eReader that you can also use to go on the web.

The second is that mine  does not recharge the battery...  I was deeply mislead into buying this  because I thought the u0026quotSonyu0026quot name would guarantee some level of  quality.  NOT a good buy.,1,0,405
A16IZ8FLLABKMZ,1313,Bought this product to complete a project of converting family tapes to DVD.  Other reviewers complain of delicate parts and difficulty in getting the tapes into the converter.  I experienced none of these problems.  The product worked as advertised.Would have been great to pay less. but that is life.  5 stars for doing that job as advertised.,5,1,345
A16JMK7V2IWZ10,23,Looks good. I like the locking feature on the display port connection. Quality looks good. Only problem is theres always a random crackling u0026 popping noise. Its from the cable because I used another cable and there was no crackling or popping sounds. Price was good but I did not return because would have paid close to purchase price for return shipping. I rated it a one star because the video worked well.,1,0,412
A16K9HO11UWFA9,2121,I recently purchased a Canon Elph 370Z Kit and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new camera.  Although it is a but a tiny pointandshoot device. it is rich in features that much larger models only dream about.  It has all of the wonderful features of the Advanced Photo System. including the midroll changing feature.  The zoom lens is quite capable of telephoto or wide frame pictures.  Also. the cameras intuitive distance sensing and shake warnings ensure clear and crisp photos of any subject or scene. My main reason for purchasing this camera was travel. I bought it with the intention of using it simply when I was travelling. but I find myself using it in place of my clunky SLR.  Highly recommend!,5,1,723
A16LWC9033XR7W,23,I purchased the nook color for its color display and the fact that you can add a micro SD card to store more books on. As a avid reader I had developed a collection of books. I usually only kept books that I really liked and donated the others to the library. With the nook color I can store up to 3.500 books on my nook or I can  store them on the SD card. This is one of the reasons why I decided to purchase the nook instead of the amazon kindle. I was not sure that an SD card could be used on the amazon kindle. Plus with the nook color you can add your own music or pictures onto the SD card and upload onto your nook color. I love the fact that it has wireless internet access. which can also be turned on or off to conserve battery power. Also with the nook color you can download magazines onto it to read. It can also be rotated lengthwise for a better when on the internet. however this feature does not work when reading a book but does work when viewing magazines. It has the pandora app preloaded onto to it so you can listen to music if you already have a pandora account with no commericals and comes with a couple of games. With the recent software up load BN has made more games and apps available for purchase. BN also has free books for downloading and on fridays if you type in free fridays into the BN search bar you can download the free book of the week. However. in mentioning the latest software update the one thing I do not like about it is that it came with a sample copy of the goodhouse keeping cookbook that to my knowledge no one has been able to figure out how to remove. So basically if you buy a nook color when it updates to the latest software version you likely to be stuck with that sample copy. In order to download onto your nook you have to set up a BN account and have a credit card stored to do that or you will have to go through the BN website each time to buy a book. The nook color allows you to customize your wallpaper which is similar to a desktop background. has the library feature which will show your books. magazines. newspapers. the myshelves feature which allows you to sort your books into categories like mystery or author etc... It has a shop feature specifically to fast access to the BN website. a web feature. apps feature with games u0026 music. and then the settings. I have found the nook color very easy to operate and am very pleased with my purchase. In fact I liked it so much that I purchased one for my mom who is not very computer savy but has even agreed that it is very simple to operate.,5,1,2565
A16M7TFU9S05N,22,The extra 10 this cable provides is definitely useful. I use it with a portable projector in a large lecture hall. and its definitely desirable to have this when the speaker wants to use a laptop with the projector while speaking in the front.,5,1,243
A16M85PZ9OVE9R,0,This stand holds up my hefty 40  LCD TV quite well. I bought this mount because the new place I moved into built the studs too far apart for my other mount. This item seemed a little questionable. but I went with it because of the reviews. Im glad I did! It isnt the sturdiest piece of equipment. but the TV doesnt sway around by itself and Im not worrying about it whenever I leave the apartment. I dont know how well it would stand up to being run into or being in an earthquake. but then again if those are potential issues then maybe a wall mount isnt too ideal in the first place! The only thing that is a little inconvenient is the arm length. It will hold the TV out quite a ways from the wall. but it has trouble keeping the TV centered on the mounting stud while its mostly compressed to the wall. Besides that. very good item.,4,1,836
A16N4XL861Q0P3,33,This is a great cover for a great price. Works as shown. stands to watch well.

A16P35YRY7M45W,34,First learn about modifying the nook tablet.  You can buy or create yourself a sd card with a custom ROM on it. Doing this lets you bypass the BN OS because the nook looks at the sd card first when booting up. it also keeps the nook OS stock and BN can do all the firmware updates they want to do without affecting the SD Card ROM.  With a custom ROM you can install apps or read ebooks not offered by BN i. e. kindle books. I love my NT and learned to make it do more than be an ereader. yet still have a stock ereader by swapping to a blank sd card. Let your Nook Tablet be an Android Tablet without the restrictions of BNs poor customer service. Im as computer knowledgeable as a rock and was able to learn how to do this in about 4 hours of reading google.  Just google.  nook tablet xda,3,0,791

A16Q3CV7TCFO4E,0,The product seems to be of high quality.  The only problem I had was it covers some of the TV outputs to mount to the tv.  The problem could lie with the TV manfacturer. The TV Model is VIZIO E260MV 26Inch Class Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTV .  I solved the problem with a metal cutting saw and some bracket modifications.  I am reasonably sure most people do not have this option. so care should be used when purchasing one or the other.,3,0,436
A16QTYVL99QHBL,46,I recently purchased this unit and had a total of 30 glorious seconds of operation before the unit fell on its face HARD. Everything about this product is just plain wrong. It is made of flimsy plastic. the drivers shipped with the unit were inadequate and the upgrade downloaded from the manufacturers site was worthless. Whether you wish to primarily output to the web or high quality video you would be much better off in checking into the Pinnacle Studio DV or DC10 Plus. and the best part is.......those cards sell for literally less then 12 the price of the Dazzle unit.,1,0,576

A16RGMORD80K9V,55,Ive had the Maxell NC II over a couple of years u0026 they are still holding up well.I now use these headphones primarily at home to relax in the recliner while listening to music or taking an undisturbed nap.I originally got them because I was a long haul truck driver u0026 the engine u0026 wind noise was just wearing me out not to mention having to turn the radio up too loud just to hear it.These headphones helped to stop that.The noise canceling feature is effective in reducing the ambient noise around me creating a much more relaxed. stress free environment.At the end of the day I wasnt nearly as tired as when I didnt use the headphones.Im not an audiophile so I cant give you stats u0026 freq s but I enjoy my music. books on tape u0026 movies more using these headphones.I also like the collapsible. over the ear design. They are comfortable u0026 I havent had any problems with them getting hot after wearing them over an extended time.The battery life is very good. the electrical cord is a good length u0026 the onoff switch is sturdy with a small green light when on.Im going to upgrade to the NC IV for home u0026 keep my NC II for in the car.,4,1,1162
A16SEF6AOKXG8Y,0,Unless your head is the size of a football players. stay away from these headphones! Im a normal sized female. and these headphones need to shrink another 2 inches to sit on my head comfortably. If I lean forward. the band falls across my eyes.The sound quality is pretty bad  even with the volume turned way up it still sounds like Im listening to a tinny radio half a block away.Finally. the earbuds hurt my ears after about 5 minutes of use. Although could that be because the headphones dont stay in place. and are always pivoting around? Im not going to wear them long enough to find out.Back to Sony I go!,1,0,611
A16SS7YYA17MIJ,6061,The GE Superadio III used to be a great radio.  I bought my first one seven years ago and it worked so well that I bought another.  I have recently purchased two more as gifts and they are not the same radio.  Sidebyside they look the same .except for the numbers on the tuning dial..  Inside they have dissimilar circuit boards.  The real difference is the two new radios are unable to tune stations nearly as well as the older radios.  I would recommend not purchasing this radio.,1,0,482

A16Y8UR43D463J,910,Cons. In a nut shell. the RIO PMP 300 MP3 was great for the first few months. I purchased it a year ago and have had many problems. As others have commented. the battery lid broke and springs open often. The result is  short piercing sound .not dangerous but extremely annoying. and the lcd  display goes ape. Music Match software was a joke but has progressed a  little  .I still can not get it to download to the Rio device with this  software..Pros. The unit is great to have while working out. The sound  is descent enough. The size is compact but then again I would rather have  some thing a bit larger.I hope that they make a larger one that holds at  least four hours of music. fixes the battery lid problem. includes great  software and has USB .as the 500 does. or FireWire support. Oh yeah. maybe  a flip top lid like the cell phones .even when the unit is in the Hold  postion the player responded to the buttons and started playing or  skipped..,3,0,957

A16ZNEZKMB6NYB,0,I have two. I made one into a clean tissue dispenser by filling a plastic round canister with tissues from a cardboard tissue box. and slipping the plastic canister into the Case Logic bag. It is a bit of effort to refill. and then I discovered that the Kleenex Oval Expressions box fits perfectly though quite snugly. The CaseLogic bag is longer. and the Kleenex box would slip down to the bottom .away from the opening at the top.. so I use a clip to roll the bottom of the CaseLogic bag up to keep the tissues at the top opening of the bag.My only complaint about the bag is about the velcro. The bag comes with a strip of velcro attached to one side. and another strip with a removable glue back that you can stick somewhere in the car to keep the bag from swinging around. I strongly dislike hookandloop because it catches on fine materials. The strip of velcro that is on the bag itself is the side that snags everything. so I have to keep the other matching side of velcro stuck on it. If it werent for the velcro. this bag would get 5 stars.,4,1,1049

A174PKDJOB9TX6,55,My first digital. after my old Canon AE1 gave up the ghost.  I needed heavy macro capability for shooting small objects. mostly for recording my students art projects.  Delighted with the ease of operation and macro really IS great. but color balance can be off sometimes .vivid  but off..  Blow ups are grainy. repetitive detail .such as background vegetation. looks like a bad computergenerated dropin effect.  I bought it on sale well below list. so overall its been a good value for me.Suggested uses. Compiling a virtual student portfolio. closeup photos. teaching beginning photography or visual composition to younger students. documentation for inventory or insurance purposes. pet photos. etc.Suggested tip.

A176509J0LQHR1,12,The 1st time I used the MAXELL VHS Cleaner. it worked great u0026 I had no problems with it.  HOWEVER. because I was still getting a buzzing noise from my VCR again a week later. I tried the MAXELL VHS cleaner again and it was a DISASTER!!!  This time. the MAXELL VHS Cleaner got STUCK in my VCR and I CANNOT remove it from my VCR after repeated attempts.  I consulted my VCR users manual and even called the manufacturer. and was told I would have to take my VCR to a repair facility!!!  I cant afford to have my VCR fixed.  This MAXELL VHS Cleaner RUINED my VCR!!!  It is a DVDVCR player and I cant use either one now!  As another AMAZON.com buyer stated. I should be reimbursed for my DVDVCR player!!!,1,0,704
A176516VE5GWZN,0,Maxell once made one of the best products for taping from a VCR. We have had two of our VCRs for more that ten years.  As soon as we began taping on this newer version. I assume. of the Maxell tape. both VCRs were victims of tapes that we could not eject.  One VCR is completely destroyed.  The other was almost ruined. but I watched a video about removing tapes that were stuck and was able to get it out. I immediately disposed of the new tapes and began taping over some of my older tapes.  I do not trust this newer Maxell product.  My sister lost her VCR as welltape stuck.,1,0,578
A1767YMDJOSZ48,13,I have had a Nook color for about 2 yrs and the charger is so cheaply made that you have to be very careful when plugging it in because it is so fragile. Since I knew how it is I knew how to take care of it before I ordered this one. I used it one time to charge and the light was not a strong light as the original charger I had before. Few weeks later I got the charger out to use again and it did not work at all! It is not bent or anything. have no idea why it stopped working!!

A1786AD3X81RDR,24,I bought these headphones to use with Trisquare eXRS radios. I wanted a headset with a boom mic rather than the earbuds that came with the Trisquare. The description of these headsets did not specify that they would work with eXRS but the price was good so I gave them a try. They work very well with the Trisquare radios. They are comfortable and the boom mic can be positioned at a desired distance from your mouth. They are sensitive enough for the VOX on the Trisquare.,4,1,473
A178RW5ZI68YR3,23,Ive had this player for about six months. About 15% of the DVDs that I own have at least one feature that can crash this player. when that happens  the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button. none of the  other buttons will work. The remote control design is pathetic. half of the  buttons are hidden by a cover. and are virtually inaccessable. The skip and  fast forward functions are combined on a single key. to fastforward you  must hold down the skip button for several seconds. if you dont hold it  down long enough it skips to the next scene. The skip backwards function  doesnt work. it can only return to the start of a scene. not an earlier  one. So if you accidently skip to the next scene you must restart the movie  from the beginning.,2,0,764
A1790D6BM0V5BQ,22,When your allinone HP T65 printer suddenly wont scan you wonder if its the cable or the printer giving the trouble.  Use this Belkin IEEE 1284 cable with its easytofasten connectors and easytotwist posts to eliminate a nonIEEE 1284 cable as the cause.  A 10 foot cable is a good length when your printer is over on a bookcase.  As for my printer problem. it turned out that the parallel port on my Dell Latitude LM had developed a bad pin 1.  Imagine.

A17FS0XVZ5V35L,22,My main reason for buying this drive was to process a few boxes of floppies .Id guess 200+ floppies. and I am about halfway through. After unboxing I was able to attach it to my Windows XP box and it picked it right up without any driver installation or administrative rights required.Using WinImage I was able to image aging floppies with  bad spots  .and ignore them even if I couldnt find a way to do so automatically. in order to retrieve data I wanted.Ive only just started using it so I cant speak to its long term reliability. but if this drive dies before I finish processing the remaining 100+ floppies Ill  modify my review accordingly.,5,1,646
A17G61MVW5IJPZ,69,Ive watched about 20 movies so far.  Most of them played fine.  A few starting glitching.  And now I cant even get a movie to play right.  And it has been only two weeks.  This DVD player also gets very hot.  So hot  that when you pop out the DVD it is warm.  I think this is because of the  AC3 processor?  But this might be the reason it is messing up.  Or it  could mean that I watched a movie that messed it up.  Anyway im returning  the unit and hopfully will get a good one.  Other then that. this unit is  great.  Very easy to use also.  I would recommend it highly.  JVC must have  had a few bad apples out there thats all.,3,0,631

These prepackaged wipes are really nice to have an easy to carry around.First I start with the wet wipe to remove grease and dirt. then I remove the moisture with the dry wipe.  You want to practice with it in order to not leave any streaks but its not too difficult to do. The wet wipes are not only good for screens but they take figure prints off the exterior on my laptop.

A17IMO8O2K84XO,1825,In June 1999. I decided to buy a small computer. The small Casio organizer managed 80% of my information needs. and the remaining 20% comprised of databank. and spreadsheet was to be covered by the new machine. I had heard about Palm handheld. but at that time it was not so common to see Palm handheld advertised aside keyboards. As for me. a keyboard was a must. I  began reading about Psion series 5 which seemed to be the .incarnation. materialization of what I figured out to be a handheld  computer. Those readings showed me some evidences. For example. that Psion had a poor service. That the series 5 had some quality problems. namely with peeling. That Psion was backed up by a crowd of skilled and enthusiastic program developers. In fact just to mention one. Pascal Nicolas. wrote more than 150 useful freewares. including the ubiquitous Macro 5. With the launching of the Psion 5mx. which sports 16 MB of RAM. I thought the quality problems were things of the past and had finally been overcome. So I bought one. The Email synchronization never worked properly. After installation. messages came in double. After the suggested upgrade. I could not get any message into Psion. Reading news groups. I learned that lots of other users had the same problem. I contacted Psion support to solve the problem however. whatever I did never worked. One month after the purchase. I noticed that in the most used keys the inscriptions began to fade and some time later. I had to punch twice or three times the key to get accented letters. One month before the warranty ended. it stopped working. At 21.30. I entered some data. One hour later.  when I turned it on. without any drop nor any misuse. only horizontal lines were shown on the screen. No readable character. Whatever I did to have it back to life. soft reset. hard reset. new batteries.  was in vain. My Psion was there. Dead. I came to know that the same problem.horizontal lines on the screen. appeared in many Psion series 5mx machines in Malaysia. They said that it cost about USD250.00 to fix it and there was no warranty that the problem would not reaper. I was traveling on vacation when all that happened and when I finally got home. with less than a month for the warranty to expire. with all the bureaucracy to send it from Brazil to the US. where I had bought it. I decided to bail out from the Psion platform. Now. I own a Visor Platinum. It is heavier than the 5 oz which .that. I consider the upper limit to carry in my pocket shirt. but now I do not have to carry the Casio Organizer plus the Psion. Only the Visor. Now. with the experience in both worlds. I learned the importance of the shape of a handheld in our daily life. In my point of view. the basic rule for a handheld computer is. it must be with you wherever you are. To fulfill this rule. it must be small and light with long battery life. A handheld computer may be fully featured. have excellent programs. but if it is not with you at the moment you need it. it does not help. If the alarm goes off. it must be near you. not in the next room. or where you probably would not hear its sound.Psion. with its bigger screen and bolder RAM. has better programs than Palm because programmers have more freedom to program considering both space in RAM and space in screen. The 12.5 oz of Psion renders it inadequate to carry in your pocket shirt. The 7.5 inches length makes it impossible to hold  with the left hand and type in with the right hand. If you do so. you will end up dropping it on the floor. Psion requires a horizontal platform for you to type. You can not have a platform in those boring moments while you are waiting in line or waiting for your flight at the airport. or waiting while  somebody else is shopping.  Those moments are perfect for maintenance of scheduled appointments. transfer of subjects from the Memo area to the proper one. What used to be boring moments turn into leisure time. With Psion. this is practically impossible due to size and weight limitations. To close this review I would say that if you do not think that the handheld must be with you all the time. you do not mind the extra weight and size. dependability is not so important to you. specially when the end of the warranty period approaches. the Psion 5 mx is the machine to go for.  If you think as I do. either Visor or Palm is the way to go .plus a keyboard for extensive entries..,3,0,4419

A17LYB7XHH2F8U,66,This is the cheesiest item I have ever been duped into purchasing in retrospect. I should have known better.

A17PNZLJOSR9DC,35,The Diamond Rio 500 is a great product!  I am very happy with it. and am glad that i didnt buy the 300 model.  The 64 bit memory is great. the design is small and compact. it sound GREAT. and it is so easy to use.  There are a few disadvantages to this MP3 player. but they arent big.  There is no AC adaptor. so you are always running off batteries. but it  lasts a long time. and if you really want to. got some rechargable  batteries.  The head phones do suck. but oh well.  They are a good brand  .Koss. but they are uncomfterable and the ear buds are too big for most  people.  Those are the only disadvantages that I have come across.  The  music is great. and it takes 57 seconds to download from your computer to  the player.  It comes with softwear. carrying case. headphones. the UBS  cable. detailed instructions .you wont need them. the softwear is very  easy to use. and one hell of an MP3 player.  I am however looking into a  memory upgrade to store more music.  I can fit about 12 songs on the memory  I have now.

A17PO2S8GAW9BJ,33,Though the V21000 is an old card. it is still very usable. even with fairly recent games.  We have three systems with the V2. an AMD K6450 .dual cards. SLI.. a PII233 .dual cards. SLI.. and a PII233 .single card.. Our favorite online game is Half Life .mainly Team Fortress.. and these antique systems consistently deliver frame rates well over 60fps. Half Life has a 3DFX u0026quotminidriveru0026quot that takes full advantage of these cards in OpenGL mode!  The primary drivers that come with the card work well  in fact. they are the only drivers I have found that consistently work at all.  The textures are very smooth. and much more viewable than the rather grainy performance of many more modern cards in OpenGL or Direct3D.  This card is a great choice for anyone with a slower cpu .or no AGP.. since the card.s. takes the load off your processor.  Im sure I will have to upgrade someday .probably PNY GeForce3 TI200..  but I have yet to see anything that will deliver this sort of performance on an older system. If you want solid performance using PCI on an antique system .like mine!.. and your favorite programs support it. buy this card.  Or better yet. buy two!,5,1,1175

Only major flaw. its CDchanger is very slow as you have to open each CD tray separately .loading 5 CDs can take  more than 1 minute.,4,1,298
A17QVUSU0WZ6K3,0,when i bought this disc drive i thought becuase it being so thin i thought it would break easily. but after awhile i noticed it was extremely tough although that almost isnt a good thing. when i open it to put in a disc when i try to shut it. it wouldnt shut so i have to close it a second time so other than that it works great!,4,1,329
A17RL6XEIP7N51,1919,When I bought my Palm Pilot two years ago...it revolutionized my life!  Okay. maybe thats a little strong.  But I found that the amount of u0026quotstuffu0026quot I needed to carry on the road decreased  considerably.This portable keyboard takes it to the next level.  I find  myself taking notes in meetings using the keyboard.  I can then copy and  paste these notes into email for easy distribution.  Graffitti works but  this keyboard makes input to.and therefore usefulness of. the Palm Pilot  even more efficient.  The carrying case .also available on Amazon.com.  makes toting the keyboard and PDA very easy.Ill never go back to taking  notes on paper again!,5,1,665

A17UHDV2O651YM,1321,I purchased the Color Nook as a Christmas present for my wife. The deciding factors over the Kindle 3G was the Tablet functionality. access to EPUB books. the ability to get books from our library and it looked really cool in the store.Well. its pretty tough to get a book from the library as there are not many books available. It was a lot of work to download EPUB files. But the major factor causing the return is that the LCD monitor has to much glare to use outside of the house. All light reflects harshly. My wife could not use it at the gym because all the lights reflected off the screen. I also learned that when using outside you cant wear sunglasses. My polarized glasses made the screen completely black. Even without the sunglasses it was almost impossible to see the screen.So. I should have went with my gut instinct which was to get a Kindle 3G and use the cell phone for email. Facebook and other Apps. Good thing I bought it at Best Buy because the return was simple and not questioned.,2,0,1005
A17UW6FGLVH6AP,712,I Ordered the Midland Handheld CB radio and received it 24 hrs later. As others have said. its a nice handheld CB but is useless without an external antenna. Ive driven around with it in Philadelphia for 3 days and have only heard people speaking 2 times. The range has to be close to 1200 feet with the attached ducky antenna. I will receive a Wilson Lil Wil external antenna in 2 days and will be able to comment further on its use with an external antenna. One comment however that noone else has mentioned. In order to use an external antenna. you have to use the Dc adapter that comes with the radio. You cannot connect an external antenna and use the radio on either of the 2 supplied battery packs. The mobile adapter that connects to the radio has the connection for an external antenna attached. Therefore. no mobile adapter .dc connector.. no place to connect an external antenna. My reason for purchasing this unit was because I was already running so many things off of dc in my car .radar detector. GPS charger. digital scanner etc.. For the price. this radio operates the same as other radios that run off dc that cost 12 the price. I ordered a Uniden pro520xl that I plan on installing in my other car. If all works out. I may scrap the midland 75822 and just get another uniden since they both require dc connections thereby making them mobile and not portable.,3,0,1377
A17VI5JKD3AQFH,2226,Having this same exact dual tray DVD player now for about 2 months. its the greatest.  No more rewinding tapes. get widescreen when you want it or when you dont. different viewing angles.zoom.. almost crystal clear  picutre reception.haivg a brand new 36u0026quot Toshiba T.V. helps.. it  unbelievable the convience this DVD player offers.  Better sound. graphics.  features. color. basically everything is better than a VCR.

A17WHEQJKD5YQV,46,This is a favorite from my childhood. I saw it in the theatre when it was first released. and I owned the album and the .widescreen. laser disc.I was so disappointed to see that this was a full frame transfer. and a lousy one at that!  One of the biggest thrills of this movie was its wide open vistas of the Mississippi River and the wonderful cinematography. This DVD release from MGMUA is grainy. dark and at times fuzzy.  The sound is terrible too. and it was terrific on the laser disc in 5.1 surround.  Youre missing the wonderful. detailed orchestrations by John Williams of the tuneful Sherman Brothers score.  I would only recommend this DVD to you if you HAVE to own a copy of it. even a bad one.  I suppose its better than nothing at all.  But not by much.My hope is now that Fox owns the MGMUA library they will properly restore and release this movie. with a remastered soundtrack and interviews with Whitaker. Foster and East.  It was a hit. back in the day. Nominated for 3 Oscars. a favorite from my childhood. and Id like to see it given the treatment it richly deserves.,1,0,1088
A17X3WD1DYWTKS,22,Even for people on a low budget this season. this is a great. fun. easytouse gift.I have owned one of these for almost 2 years now. and have found many ways to get exactly the picture I want. With three photo sizes that change in the viewer. one is always guaranteed to know approximately how thier photo will turn out. Though not particularly inexpenxive. the APS film system is reasonable. and the pictures turn out great! For a younger. or older. aspiring photographer. this is the camera to start with!,5,1,506
A17Y3M85GW2NHV,0,These headphones are terrible.  I purchased two sets of headphones and within 2 months both are broken.  After just a few uses. the sound stops working in one of the earpieces.  This happened in both sets of headphones. so I would rate this product as 100% defective.,1,0,267
A17YTARUM8WLHC,1818,Having first used this camera. when a friend bought one. We fell in love with it. We now have one. and have recommended it numerous times as the  best digital out there!We use our primarily for Ebay photos and for  selling. I dont know how or why anyone would not like the floppy disk  storage characteristic. It makes using the digital about as cheap and easy  as taking pictures has ever been!For better clarity and resolution. we  resize almost all of our photos down by 50 %. .then use the sharpen tool.  Adjusting the brightness and contrast also helps immensely!,5,1,568

A1824512R93ICL,23,As with most products. the efficacy of the Skipdr depends on how well the instructions are followed.  Go to ..... and read all the instructions before you proceed.  This is a great device if used correctly.  I have repaired playstation 2 games that were not even being recognized by the system because of damage now they work perfectly well.  My only complaint is the quality of the resurfacing wheel.  Mine was glued unevenly and fell apart after about twenty uses.  So. I bought a new resurfacing wheel  no big deal!  Note to the reviewer who complained about the residue on the CD.  this is residue that the skipdr is removing from the CD and indicates it is being repaired .as you would have found out had you read the instructions!..,4,1,738
A182GCZ1JR1TWH,0,The sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction. The wireless system.  however is pretty bad.

A182U5XEA20G3G,111,I bought this from B u0026 N and had to return it back in June and they have still not credited me for the return.  I have called them at least ten times over the past two months and have been on the phone at least two to thee hours each time and they have still not credited me yet for the nook touch.  I am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them.  Buyer beware where you buy your Nook touch.,3,0,452
A18349V9GPP9OA,1515,This card is great for watching TV. but unless you have a fairly nice computer. the video capture program stinks.  I had a 233MHz computer with 96MB of RAM when I bought it. and it was constantly crashing my computer. and the video quality wasnt very good.  I just bought a 566MHz computer which has 64MB of RAM. and its working pretty well.  Its running well .it doesnt crash the computer anymore.. and its capturing great video.  The only problem now is that its still a little bit slow .it makes you think the computer has frozen. and then just when you get ready to hit the power switch... it starts working again.. and it doesnt have an output. so you cant put your edited video back onto a VHS tape.,4,1,705

A187F742JS8F6Y,3942,I got my Rio 500 a few days ago. and so far. Im pretty satisfied with it.  Its a really cool. well designed piece of technology.  It has a nice back lit display that shows the artist and song name. something the 300 didnt  have .although the display didnt include the bitrate info. which the 300  DID have..  Also. the unit has a menu which you can customize your playlist  and adjust the equalizer .including custom bass and treble settings. among  other things.  The 500 sounded excellent using my own headphones although  the bass was extremely lacking.On the negative. the documentation  included with the Rio was terrible. if you are new to MP3s. it could be  frustrating.  The software was decent. but not that fast at encoding songs.  Ive heard complaints that theres no FM tune .but if you have your MP3s.  why on earth would you listen to the radio?..  And I still think the it  drains batteries WAY too fast it says 12 hours  thats your whole one  hour playlist 12 times in a row but Ive yet to have a battery last over 4  .maybe they meant at a below 128 bitrate..Overall. I think that USD250+  might be a tad overpriced.  If it gets down to 150. then it would  DEFINITELY be worth it.,4,1,1196
A187S6RMLW86N,35,This product Im sure works in some cases but in the case of my VHS cleaning job. it did not work. It did improve the picture but did not completely fix the picture. I gave it 3 stars rather than one star because I dont know if a wet VHS head cleaner would have done the job better and I made a poor selection or if the VHS is failing in a different way.,3,0,353

A18AGK1AF8AUP7,0,I really liked the movie u0026 watched it with my reading class once we got finished with that story in our reading books.  It was a little disappointing because the movie didnt focus more on the cave scenes .was actually different than what we read. or finding the treasures.

A18D490T2ANGMF,0,This universal charger is priced at over USD25 on other websites.  Therefore. this is a great buy in terms of price.  You cannot beat this value if you are traveling abroad and need a universal charger.  I am giving it a 4 star because. the USB charger port charges my cell phone a little slower than a regular charger.  To make this product perfect. buy a three plug adapter .very inexpensive.. so you can charge your laptop. cell phone. and digital camera at the same time.  Otherwise. you can only charge one product at a time.  In some countries. the hotel room may have only one plug in which means you can only use one adapter.,4,1,633
A18DPJIG3K93QE,4,...I finally got the card. and installed it with ease! Unfortunately nothing worked.

A18DTRU4YEXJWA,3133,This book is full of a lot of really good information. It is actually more like a digital photography encyclopedia. It is both a primer on digital photography and on processing digital images. I really like it except for these significant flaws.1. The images used for the examples in Photoshop are not available for download. Ive bought many books on Photoshop. but they have always included image files. either by download or on a CD. so you could work through the examples.2. The information appears in a 600x800 resolution window. Theres no way to resize it. making it difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.3. Although Photoshop Elements 4.0 has been out for a while. this product only goes as far as version 3.4. Fifty bucks. I think. is way high for an ebook.As a source of good information on digital imaging and processing. this product is top notch. If they were to lower the price to USD30. provide support for higher resolution monitors. update it to the current Photoshop software. and include images for the tutorials. I would give it a 5 star rating without hesitation. Until that happens. it only deserves 2 stars.,2,0,1137
A18F4TZONKVB6Q,1414,A very well designed GPS unit. Locks on quickly. LCD is easy to read in most conditions. User interface is well laid out. but cant be modified very much by the end user. Sun and moon position indicator is great for times when your direction of travel is difficult to determine from GPS data. There are tricks for creating simple maps using the inernal icons. Safe for use around water. Will float. but battery compartment is not sealed and the batteries will get wet. Overall battery life is good at right around 15 hours on a new set of AAs. Back light is a battery killer. but very useful when trying to find your way in the dark. Of the three different GPS units I own. this is my favorite and best performing. Well worth the money.,5,1,735
A18G22TSZ58V1I,23,Bought it for my wife to use primarily as a reader but also to occasionally access the net and read email when not at her computer.  She absolutely loves it.

A18HHON17J3LH0,22,This is a great and simple eBook reader. Its light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading. its small enough that its easy to take with me. the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger. and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain.

A18HHR4U2NPU1B,1415,I got my first one when Vista Imaging .viCAM. was selling them. Now 3Com is using the viCAM technology. It is the BEST webcam on the market. I own two of them and the Lens Pack.

NetMeeting etc.. I ran one of the first webcams on the Internet and have used many cameras over the years. The 3COM is the best camera. it is a USB camera by the way. It works excellent in low light.

A18K5F83ARF1CF,2222,I bought this product despite so many negative reviews. I have this product with me for about 3 months now. Its been great. If you are looking for simple and normal wireless headphones witout any advanced features or top of the line sound quality. this will be more than sufficient for you. I have a JVC home theater. DVD player and VCR. Having bought all of these from JVC. I decided to go with this headphone and it turned out to be a good one. I did experience little static couple of times. but it was not as scary as others explain. I would definetly recommend it.,4,1,569
A18MN3B52HHBH1,11,I purchased the Kensington 64068F computer cable and lock because I was familiar with the Kensington Brand. I have been very disappointed with this product. and its use with my HP Pavilion dv6 laptop. The manner in which the key fit into the lock has always been a problem it has always been difficult to fit in and turn to lock it. I have used it about twentyfive times until an internal part broke off rendering it inoperable. This means a product failure in less than a month. I am concluding that the design of the locking mechanism is faulty. It was not a good buy.,1,0,570

A18NLG35HLRE41,24,We bought one of these for my motherinlaw hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use. It has been nothing but a pain. Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library. This requires a process that involves going through hoops. a computer. and an Adobe ID and software. Having experience with an Amazon Kindle .the very basic one. and iPads with library books. this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my inlaws. What should be a twofive step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook. There have been several occasions where my fatherinlaw .who is ok with technology. has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself. Otherwise. it is nothing but frustrating.,1,0,925

A18PKOP4YV216U,1218,I bought this camera about 6 months ago. so the price has dropped considerably.  I have yet to test its waterproof capabilities. but so far the pictures have turned out to be average.  There are two reasons why I  would not recommend buying this camera.  1.  The square viewfinder is  difficult to see.  Many of the pictures I took were off center in the  beginning.  .If you have a lot of people taking pictures of you with it. I  guarantee most of the pictures will have some part of you cut off.. 2.  The  free u0026quotcarrying caseu0026quot is really cheap.  I plan to buy some other  type of case because Im afraid that the lens will get damaged through the  cheap material.  Overall. this camera isnt too bad for a point and click.  but Id look around and see what you can find.  Dont buy this camera just  because its weatherproof.  The other features wont justify its price.,3,0,883
A18PSYIYVGOU54,23,I bought this unit with some trepidation because of some other reviews.  but I have not had the 1st problem with the Panasonic.  No freezing. pixelating...

I cant drop  this DVD player down a whole star because of the buttons on the remote.,5,1,355
A18Q0GISPTKJHS,6574,Hard to learn . Better well witten manual is in order.  My main problem is with the retailer.Ordered 6 wks ago. Rcd what was probably a refurbished.  After great harangue. replaced but with PAL model. Works only  with Euro TV. No warranty or registration card. After much more harangue.  3rd one u0026quotwill be shipped soonu0026quot.

A18Q5L8RHXZEDR,11,For the price. to me this was a really great DVD player. accept for the same lipsynch problem other people are getting at some times.  It is fairy easy to fix so it doesnt bother me that much for what the machine can do.,4,1,220
A18QVKW05ZZA1E,33,i bought this as a small part of a birthday present for my girlfriend who loves disney. Appearances is fantastic. though with the way it is made Im sure long term it will fade some and lose a few gems. But for the price I feel that is expected. It is a full 8 gigs which is awesome for what I needed. I tested it and it seems to hold data fine without corruption. I am putting Disney movies on it to make it a really unique gift. The USB is hidden on the back. it slides out which I knew would be somewhat problematic before I even got to the computer. I found that it was easiest to hold my finger underneath to prevent the USB from sliding back because it doesnt stay in place perfectly without a little help. I would recommend this as a gift or as a nice size novelty drive for your self. It comes on a chain that I would say would leaves green marks on your neck.  Ill be putting it around a stuffed animal to finish this part of my gift.,4,1,942
A18R1L6LGWKFBX,38,There is nothing special about these other than they have colors.  They simply wrap around. there is no loop .like a belt. that keeps the tie from spreading out.

A18S2VGUH9SCV5,12,I have mixed feelings about the tablet.  I really like and dont like features of this tablet.  Im keeping my fingers crossed that later versions improve the potential of the Nook.LIKE.1.  layout and function of touch screen is intuitive  the Kindle Fire requires instruction2.  builtin wifi3.  the hardware is solid4.  the price is competitive5.  Netflix and Hulu are available and app market is expandingDONT LIKE.1.  no bluetooth or GPS2.  do not have access to the full Android Market3.  no video rental option  apple and Amazon tablet have better market places4.  only 8 GB memory and although it can be expanded with microSD. less convenient than other tablets5.  the ereader is not as good as a Kindle but then what is?  at least the iPad allows for the Kindle appFor now. Im sticking with my Kindle Fire over this Nook but Im keeping my options open for future purchases.,4,1,878

A18SGGRTJKKHR3,0,The only thing going for this item is the price.  Three of the hinge bolts had rust in it.  The arm comes apart at one of the hinges so you mount the bracket to the wall and the other bracket to the TV and then hang the TV back onto the hinge.  I had to struggle a bit to get the TV angle just right since there was quite a bit of binding between the hinge pin and the sleeve.  I couldnt free the TV either and reposition myself due to the binding.  Eventually. I powered through it and got the sleeve seated on the pin.  For a little of USD20 for the mount. Im not complaining too much though so I give it an average rating.,3,0,625
A18SHK5HLUCFK0,3639,I ski .or board. all day with this earbud and a 280SLK on a NiMH battery.  I have used TalkAbouts while skiing for a few years  but just got the 280 and the earbud. and it makes a WORLD of difference!  The 280s lock feature  lets me pack it down under layers.  The earbud and wires stay well under  layers .hat. shirt. etc. as well.  Only the mic sticks out from the side.  which I can click to talk at any time.  It has been over a foot under the  snow with my head when I blow a 360  and still works perfectly.  This  earbud is a *must* for skiiers .or boarders!  I do both..,5,1,577
A18SHK5HLUCFK0,1919,I charge up the battery in the cabin overnight.  I turn the radio on during the caravan drive to the mountain. ski all day with the earbud. and leave it on until we arrive back at the cabin.  I have only seen it get  below half charge once!,5,1,240
A18TBB6FC3973Z,11,I bought these Maxell Ear Buds several months ago and I just wasted my money.  They are painful to wear if you wear them for a long period of time. They are just poorly design and not made for every ear hole.  If you have small ears or even medium size ears. you may find them painful to wear for a period of time.  Dont waste your money and move on and find something else.  Thumbs down from me!,1,0,396
A18TJIULDHRM0Y,22,The drive arrived on time and was a good price. However. it is a noisy drive compared to other floppy drives I have used. It stays on and makes noise when not in use. It is quite irritating. You have to shove the disk hard into the drive or it wont acknowledge it is in the drive. a pain in itself. I had trouble adding files to already in use disks claiming it needed to be formatted again. which would cause me to lose the data already put on the disk. I got tired of the noise. it hit the trash can.,1,0,502
A18U05IGMK1FVV,0,Best buy.  Excellent quality.  Thinest case around.,5,0,51
A18VOL7L3WS2M,1820,Ive bought my garmin about a year ago. It is my first car navigation device. After using it for a year. my results are mixed. First. the good parts. I love its portability. taking it around US is great. and it dazzles airport security. The street coverage in the Bay Area is pretty good. Now for the bad parts. I was hoping that StreetPilot would work like a friend in the passenger seat that knows where you are going. A few drawbacks that Garmin had to make to sell it so cheap make this more like you are driving with an Idiot Savant who knows the city really well. but has no common sense. The biggest complaint is the user interface experience. Entering a destination address is painful. and unforgiving. probably on the order of setting up your VCR for recording. The display is small. and has few colors. The turn directions can be confusing in hairy situations. such as when you are coming off Bay Bridge. and road splits in about 4 highways and two exits. My biggest complaint is that it takes several minutes to calculate a route to a new destination. This means that if you miss a highway turn. it will be several minutes before StreetPilot will give you a new route. By this time. you are 3 miles away from your original destination. If all you have to go by is Garmin. it might take you  710 mins before leaving the driveway. 24 mins to acquire sattelites. 23 to enter an address. 23 for it to compute the route. When getting the address. make sure that you get an exact spelling. Bella Rita is not Dollerita. In conclusion. you can count on Garmin to get you there. but it might be slow. and you still have to use your brain and navigation skills. Cant wait until those nifty DVD navigation systems Ive seen in Tokyo make their way to US.,4,1,1752
A18VP6LYBOEW6X,0,Totally disappointed with this product. Purchased it after reading several positive ratings on Amazon but the disc did not work in my car. The car CD player kept on displaying werror while reading this disc.,1,0,207

A18X0NU4XTNO37,0,Good quality.  Serves it purpose.  Sound quality not as good as direct aux input. but if only option. gets it done.,4,1,115
A18XRDV8GCM7XQ,45,Works great with windows 7 Just plug and it automatically installs drives. Its great as described!Really super easy and even formatted old old Macintosh floppy and erased it for me so I could build new floppy. woot. woopt! Thanx. Robotic Joe,5,1,241
A18YDKJ6MLVYZL,34,I found this to be a good product for the price.  If you need a nice. light weight mount. this is a good way to go.  Easy to install.,4,0,133
A1904MIN3H7Y5G,55,Navigation for the most part works OK. although sometimes when you cross another highway the software gets lost.The real problem is its primitive user interface. Being a software developer myself I was able to install maps but it is not an experience for the faint of heart. Worst. the entry of new address is so bad that on one occasion when we were driving to a medical appointment .15 min drive. we arrived at destination before my wife was able to finish entering the address.One advice to wizzards at Garmin. Pressing u0026quotFindu0026quot button when screen prompts you to select u0026quotFindu0026quot option should not result in loss of entire data laboriously entered. just because software expects you to press u0026quotEnteru0026quot button.,2,0,753
A1906D1SZRVTF9,0,These are good quality. reliable tapes.  Ive used many over the years and I never had a problem. Id recommend these to any remaining Hi8 users.,4,1,143
A1913AA532GG6Y,11,Well for the price it was good considering it came free with my PC. but after a year the magnet fell out .which wasnt hard to fix. but then the wiring started to break so it died.,3,0,179
A191QO429221AA,3,First of all. when I opened the box there was no user guide. and when I installed it to watch a movie there was alot of snow. I tried to adjust the tracking and there was still snow. The sound was terrible. This has been a very disappointing experience for me.,1,0,260
A191T9WBGY925O,34,The speaker adjacent to the cord gives great sound but the speaker opposite side of the cord is horrible. The head set is very bulky. Despite these inconviences this product has great sound.,4,0,190
A19314SP6ZX8AD,11,Very un happy..sent it back and did not get all of my refund back!,1,0,66
A19339C3T69GE7,610,Super this is not. Better than my alarm clock radio. not as good as my car radios. even when I take the Super outside. It cant separate weak NPR stations I want to hear from local community college station. It can separate the stronger 60mileaway NPR station. which isnt as good. better than most radios. So. Im keeping it. But Im disappointed. Good sound.,3,0,356
A193W3E3OBLKKC,2,This battery will only hold a charge for about 34 of a day while on standby.  The original battery would hold a charge for 56 days for the first couple of years.,1,0,161
A194B7I9GVMZ0K,22,My friend bught this model in 1998. I loved it so much that I searched for two years to have one. I found it in Colorado.I paid 220.00 Dollars for this one. And over all sounds even better than the RVB99 Or the RV90 .assault. Mine is the RVB90LTDIt packs 52 watts. My friends envey mind for the doubled impactof sound that theirs have. I love thay way the bass booms and still have the full range as well. It never sounds destorted andIt loves to Eat Batterys! that is my only complaint. I recomend this Loaded Boom Box to every one ! If you cant find theRVB90LTD the RVB99 is almost as good but only has 26 watts per channel. I love this Stereo for cammping and on the Boat And at the cabin. There is one more draw bock With the RVB90LTD it it weighs 29 pounds without batteries And 32 pounds with. Compared to the RVB99 that weighs 24 pounds. It is discontiued But if you find A RVB90LTD Get it you will love the heavy sound and clarity it will give you. And the full function remote will never make you get up to change to music ! unless the Batteries go dead in the remote. This one of the best products That JVC has come out with since 1998. Thanks JVC YOUR THE BEST !!!Feb.21 2003,5,1,1186
A195BG3CUCC4CO,0,decent handheld... it works okay.. not much range. but you get what you pay for.,4,0,80
A195CDIU2OGXT7,11,and these worked great! Memorex has free downloadable templates. so formatting was easy. This was my first CD project and my artwork was full bleed heavy ink coverage. so I had some doubts about quality. The stock .although admittedly lightweight.held up beautifully. If youre looking for highend glossy effects. you wont be happy. I did experience some registration issues .see other reviews. when I didnt monitor my printer closely. That said. Id definitely use these againthey made my project easy. inexpensive and professionallooking.,4,1,538
A195XBK3YKAMDS,0,When I got my graduation money in 99 I was looking for a good system at a cheap price.  When I came across the Panasonic AK17 store model I started fiddling around with it and I liked what I saw.  It was pretty easy to use. I liked the different settings .Live. Soft. Hall. Clear. and others.it had. and the radio sounded pretty good with the *v.bass on so I bought it.  When I got it home I found it pretty easy to setup and you dont really need to look at the manual to set it up.  I first tried out the tape deck since I wasnt able to do that in the store and I didnt have a big problem with it but I notice that that its kinda loud when you click the buttons.  Next I tried out the CD player and right away I noticed something when I went to put the second CD in the player... it was way too loud while switching and it took too long.  u0026ltu0026lt All that just made one star vanish.  I then went on to set my radio stations and I didnt realize that I had more than 12 fm stations that I liked.  When I found out that I could only have 12 stations I had to sacrifice some of my stations and just deal with my ultimate favorite.  u0026ltu0026ltThat whole situation made another star vanish which is why I gave it 3stars.For those looking for that deep bass that vibrates your body... well this is not the system for you so continue browsing.,3,0,1347
A196G25ZD6KOUY,0,Bought this as a replacement for my misplaced Garmin GPS data cable.  Was hoping I could use it to also charge the GPS when in the car when combined with a cigarette lighter USB charger.  For whatever reason. the GPS will not charge with this cord.  Oh Well. for the price I guess I shouldnt complain.,3,0,301

A197BXT9IUTH5E,45,I am a college student and space is at a premium for me. so a trackball was the first option that I though of.  I looked around and the company that I thought of first was Logitech. I knew that they make superior  products.  I love the trackball. it took a little while to get used to. but  now I use it for everything.  It can be a little twitchy and sometimes a  little hard to use.  I find that when I use it during HalfLife and other  games that it can be VERY difficult to use.  Overall the ball is good.  especially when space is at a premium.,5,1,549
A197MNRHT8VT6J,814,I have spent 5 nights on the phone with customer service trying to get a nookbook that was bought and paid for downloaded into my account.  The customer service line that could barely speak english continued to push me off by telling me that I had to wait 24 hours to complete the order.  They said that because the christmas volume was to large for their system to handle.  After 5 nights of this excuse. Im still on hold for a manager.  THIS IS B.S.!!!I wish that I would have bought a Kindle now.  For anyone considering a Nook. I would strongly suggest that you call or try to call Barnes and Nobles customer service to find out how you like dealing with them if you have a problem.  Oh and by the way. the local store cant help you with the Nook book orders. so it doesnt matter that they have a location 5 mins from the house.I plan on writing a review everyday until they resolve my problem.  This should be an easy fix.This was my third book purchased.

A197U77X9DFSCL,0,Bought this so I could use an old AT keyboard with my newer computers. It works great. and is high quality. The picture for this product is wrong. but I received the correct adapter when I ordered.,5,0,197
A198FASAPP8OWH,0,I received this camera last Christmas as a gift.  Ive used it for one full year and have really enjoyed it.  Its so easy to use and not a bother to carry around with me.  The photos have been enjoyed by all the people that I have taken pictures of and they were surprised on how bright and clear the results were.  I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a fuss free camera.,4,1,378
A1993B9XGKKY9P,4647,This is a great camera for the money. Very easy to use. After taking it out of the package. within an hour. I had pictures on my auction pages. I use the 24 images  just what I need for auctions.  I took some great  scenic shots last weekend and viewed them through my television like a  slideshow. The pictures were bright and beautiful. Closeups are a little  blurry. Pics are fine with the other settings. Batteries go dead real fast  if you use without the adaptor. so dont use the lcd screen while you are  taking pictures.  I took about 50 pictures over the weekend with the same  batteries.Other people who have seen my camera. cant believe I paid  less than USD200. They have ones they paid over USD400 for. that arent any  different than this one. In fact. they said they liked mine better and  offered to trade. So far. so good.  If I have any problems at a later date.  I will let you know. I would like to know also how to get extra memory  cards. Thanks for listening. I dont think you will be disappointed in this  camera.,5,1,1036
A1993QHUZGTAIG,22,Why are used items more than new? I see that frequently here on Amazon but dont understand it.Certainly. dont pay USD50 for this. In fact. if you can find something else that works. dont buy this. I have had the NookColor for 4 months and I am on my 4th power cord. Barnes u0026 Noble continues to provide them free. under warranty. for the first year.Go to the Barnes and Noble site. See the discussions there. These are universally trashed because they are trash. Shame on Barnes u0026 Noble. It may be a small thing. but it tarnishes the Nook Color. I have a Kindle Fire and do not have issues with the power cord which is much the same.Alternatives. one person discovered one that works. something from Walmart. Again. see the discussions on Bu0026N. Alternatives are very hard to come by. Power supplies are proprietary. Even when asked point blank what Bu0026N plans to do with this piece of junk. there is no reply.If you can wait out the transit time. go ahead and get the nook color. If you want a device that is available to you everyday. probably not the nook color because inevitably youll be without a power cord.However. Bu0026N and Sony. at least. even Kobo. are introducing new products this spring .2012.. so wait u0026 see.If I could give this thing negative stars. it would get a 5. Simply because there is no excuse. This is not new technology. This is just shoddy crap.,1,0,1390
A1993QHUZGTAIG,12,I started reading on my iPod and loved it. Had tons of books right there to choose from u0026 it was all portable. Decided I wanted a bigger screen and color. Had a difficult time at the outset w Bu0026N who overcharged my credit card. Got that fixed. Got the Nook and immediately loved it. But the color turned out to be not that thrilling and I would forgo that now. Im not reading little kids books. Then. my email quit working about a month later. They fixed it over the phone once. but it didnt stay fixed. Now the power cord has a break in it. a wire showing and cannot fix it with electrical tape. Naturally. their cords are proprietary. So. buying another.I dont NEED more email sources. have a computer. a smart phone. and an iPod Touch. But its on the NookColor. so it turned out to be handy. until it quit. And the power cord. reinforce yours as soon as you get it. I am probably hard on it. reading while the power cord is powering the device. and bending it in ways it probably should not be bent. but its still disappointing for nearly USD250 and after only a month of use. Took me a year to bend my Macs power cord to the point of no repair.Its not perfectly weighed and tends to flop over when holding it from the bottom.I probably would not buy it again. Id buy Sony instead. I have an older Sony and I think their quality is better. And they have a better selection of sic fi in their Readers Store. Bu0026N seems to have a large number of romantic novels of no interest to me. Its a great little gadget when all works well. But Ill probably buy Sonys new reader too to get the books I want. and their device also allows library borrowing on line.  Oftentimes. Bu0026N does not have a sic fi title I want.When Bu0026 N doesnt have the book. I get it from iBooks or Powells which I can get on my iPod. Nook does allow some books to be loaned.If none of these things apply to you. go ahead a buy it and enjoy. Its great when it works and you can find the book you want.  And I will continue using it myself when I get these glitches cleared up. Its an expensive reader. A cheaper one may work for you. provide what you want. and you can save a few bucks. Check around first. I bought on line. Buying in the store may be better. You can check the feel u0026 heft and decide if you need color.,4,1,2307

A19A6A3Q1K59OV,1010,These seem like capable wireless speakers. however I wanted to use them as rear speakers for my home theater.  I discourage you from doing this.  They are equipped with a power saver which only actives the speakers when there is a signal.  So. if there is not a signal to the rear channel. or the volume is too soft. the speakers will cut out .for example  during a quiet conversation between two people..  When this happens. youll hear a loud pop.  Then. when the sound comes back on. theres about a 2 second delay. and you lose the effect.I went ahead and kept them. but not for my home theater.  I hooked them up to the headphone jack and used them outside with the batteries for listening to music. cds. etc when working out back.  They work fine for this .just dont leave them outside or put them anywhere near the pool!..Hope this review helps.,3,0,850
A19AIVXSO40F90,0,Not bad for the price however. the short cord makes it difficult for computer use. since my computer is not too near my monitor.  Furthermore. after a few months of using it. the right earpiece is starting to die.  The sound quality is okay and the fit is surprisingly comfortable for hard plastic earbuds however. you probably will want these out of your ears within an hour!,3,0,376
A19B161OOMFA9E,15,I bought three Viewsonic monitors over the past three years.PS790. GS7902. and E771.. and man. what a huge mistake!

A19B3LR2VGAP88,22,These jewel case inserts worked very well. but what makes this a 5star is the software from Memorex that makes it easy to set the titles and import pictures.  They also supply you with many interesting backgrounds for your labels and jewel case inserts.  This is the same software for the CD labels. so it makes it easy to learn.  I was able to supply our kids with DVDs of them as children. each with their individualized jewel case and DVD label.  Made a great Christmas present.,5,1,481
A19B5DR98JN3WX,3637,Ive had these headphones for about two months.  And theyre a great deal for the price.The sound isnt bad.  The bass slightly drowns out the treble. and could be deeper and more clear.  The treble itself could also  produce clearer midtones.  But again. the sound is decent. and the treble  and bass can be adjusted with an equalizer.  Also. the sound doesnt become  harsh when turning up the volume.The headphones are very comfortable.  although they look a bit strange because they curve outward from the head.  So the head winds up looking like an alien... They also have a long cord  with volume and mute control.  The long cord and volume control are  convenient. but you have to hold the mute button down. as it doesnt behave  like a light switch.  Still. I often dont use the mute button because the  headphones insulate well.  So even if the mute button is on. its hard to  hear others.  At the same time. you wont bother people with loud  music.Overall. in spite of their weird look. these headphones are a good  deal for the price. and provide great comfort. decent sound. and convenient  volume control.,4,1,1113
A19BAUIS81UVJH,11,This thing has not worked right since I received it! You read three or four pages and it will freeze every time. I bought one from my daughter and have not had a problem with that one!,1,0,184
A19CV4KEXXAA1N,55,I got mine from Bu0026N and Im very happy with it! My color ebooks look so great on it. The only problem I have is with playing youtube videos. Im using the link Bu0026N put on my bookmarks.Other than that though. its awesome. It works really well u0026 havent had any trouble with any ebooks....however some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked updown instead of sideways like regular books.UPDATE.After playing with it a little longer. I got things going better. My youtube videos all work fine and I love it even more now.I have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since I was trying to find one I liked .such as Sony Touch. kindle and a few others which are all newest models. and my NookColor is my absolute favorite!A few problems that I hope may be fixed with future updates is when I visit certain pages .ex. google.com. u0026 tap a text box to type something in. my keyboard will dissappear u0026 I have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappear.The other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the way.In any case. I still LOVE it. The color is AMAZING u0026 I can use this for hours! No eye strain trouble here u0026 it is able to read EVERY ebook I load onto it. I havent had to buy any Bu0026N books yet because I already owned so many,5,1,1295
A19D2SBM4FLBT7,1141,The Sony Mavica was my first color digital camera.  Although I took a lot of pictures with it. I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution  640 by 480 just  isnt good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all. the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 8001000  resolution. preferably more.2.  The LCD is too hard to use. especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.3.  The floppys just  dont store enough.  If you go on vacation. you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.On the plus  side. the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesnt make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution  and maybe youll only have to buy one.P.S. I traded up to a Kodak DC260 and like it fine.,3,0,884
A19DADU4OY5BOA,11,Was somewhat hesitant to purchase this product after reading a couple negative reviews on the display.  but after receiving and using this product I am quite pleased with it considering the low price I paid.Easy to use.  which was one of my criteria.  There is little to fault the display. . . .  it is reasonably readable if the unit is not positioned at too much an angle for viewing.  I have no regrets.,4,1,406
A19DB7OTD7XTNF,4445,I reallt like the player itself.  It looks nice and the quality is excellent.  The headphones that come with the unit are rediculous. terrible. and uncomfortable.  If you are willing to spend twenty bucks on  good headphones additional to the diskamn this is a good system.  Another  downside is that it does not read all CDR disks.,4,1,332
A19G537GXYURZC,99,I purchased the Sony DVPS560 which is VERY similar to this model.  Just after having the machine one year. which just happens to be the extent of the warranty it began having problems.  It would sporatically give us a C13 or NO DISC message.  Other times it played fine.  At first we thought it was the disks we rented but the problem got more and more common.  We cleaned disks.  It even started doing this with new disk straight out of the package.  I tried contacting Sony online.  They made me jump through a bunch of hoops. things to try.  None of it worked.  I called them.  After going through the thousand voice menus I finally got a real person.  He told me to take it to a repair place and see if it needed cleaned.  So I did.  I paid for a .USDUSDUSD. estimate only to find out it didnt need cleaned but needed a new part which would cost me nearly .USDUSDUSD. with labor.  I can buy a brand new. nonSony. player for a little more than that and it will play MP3s. CDRRW. DVDRRW. all of which my Sony never could do.I called Sony to see if they would make this right.  I sought out the Sony name believing it to be the best available and thought maybe they would like to keep up this reputation.  But nooo.  My year was up. they had my money and they didnt care.  And from what I see on Amazon there are several other people who have had this same problem.  We have friends who had the exact same problem with their Sony DVD player as well....Sorry but if you dont want to waste your money dont buy Sony.,1,0,1514
A19GGTZMA9WP9J,24,They sent out an identical device with a different model number...SABRENT External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive SBTUFDB .Black.instead of theSabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive .FLUDRV. Blackwe ordered...  The device repeatedly detected floppies as writeprotected.  Could not readwrite to a single disc.  100% fail rate.  The LED display did not even have a bulb behind it.  They put a sticker on it saying it is a FLUDRV when it is clearly labeled otherwise.  The SBTUFDB received much inferior reviews compared to the FLUDRV. I was just curious to see what was actually sold to me so... Oh look whats inside! Its NECs FD3238H.... you can find these for 4 dollars new.  This one looked like it barely made it through the cold war. Be careful and check what they send you!  Its old refurb from dumped laptops.  Waste of time and money.

A19H0T2YLBMSCE,1,This item was not what I needed. I am frustrated with the fact that the picture represents the right cable. yet it is not the right cable. I dont blame the vendor selling it. Sometimes the pictures are from other sellers and Amazon assigns the picture on file for that item description.,1,0,286
A19HA89L528MI2,0,This is a very sturdy and high quality wall mount. The metal is indicative of much higherpriced models than the low price of this item. Once you have it mounted. it works great with a full range of motion and the tv feels very secure.The only problem I have is the installation process itself. You have to loosen all the nuts required for getting the range of motion. and it seems that the nuts were all tightened at the strongestmanintheworld competition. It was VERY difficult to get them to loosen initially.The other installation issue is that the extensions that are included to mount different size TVs did not align properly and the screws provided were the wrong height. The mount comes with a bunch of different screws with varying lengths and thickness. but none of them worked without modification. As a result of those two problems. I had to come up with a juryrig solution to getting the four expansion pieces attached to our 400x400 TV .Sony Bravia.. Its not a bad solution  putting the screw through one of the slats rather than an actual screw hole along with adding a couple washers to create tension with the toolong screws  but Id rather it be truly universal as the description claims.But even with the installation difficulties. Id still buy the product again because its great quality for a low price.,4,1,1323
A19HIX0G8B96KD,22,Product showed up in the mail a day early. everything was exactly as advertised u0026 worked perfectly. I recieved a timely. followup. personal email from the stores managerowner to ensure everything was ok. I would certianly buy something from this company again!,5,1,264

A19ITM4U1L4RL5,1919,There is no better place to turn for a protective case for the Palm V. and this case gets that job done while keeping the palm slim and neat.HotSync? No way... not with the case on. and I find the case gets  in my way when Im working with the unit.Best used for transportation  and protection of the palm. when *NOT* in use  if you want something else.  get something else. because this product wont get things done.,3,0,416
A19KN0DW4P6EM2,0,I had bought this camera model last month and need I say more. its horrible! its blurry. its by no means 2.8 there is a focus and zoom feature which doesnt work. I own 7 of these cameras and for some reason this model camera is the only one that dont work..i advise you to buy something from a different company this companys customer support is very bad.,1,0,355
A19L4D1K8IKB9K,3535,Having read another customers review about the radios usefulness for skiing we purchased two for our most recent outing and we were not let down. Although we never tested the range to the full they provided  excellent communication when in areas .such as the tree line.where the  other members of the party are not always visable. I also found that the  batteries lasted longer than expected. Although i would recommend changing  the batteries when they get down to one bar as the reception became quite  grainy. Other than that an excellent buy. the secure channel was very  useful as is the call feature. Along with the radio we also tried out the  PTT ear bud and talk activated mic boom. See my review of those in their  section.,5,1,733
A19L4D1K8IKB9K,1719,Although this is a good accessory to have i wouldnt recommend it over the Ear BudMic for skiing. especially if you wish to conceal it. I used one for half a day under my ski hat and goggles. While comforatable with just  the hat as soon as the goggles are placed over it the strap squezes the ear  piece against the ear which became increadably painfull after a while.  Another draw back with this is that if another person is talking and you  talklaugh or breath heavily against the boom it cuts out the other person.  Which can be very anoying. It also takes a while to cut in when you talk so  you have to repeat yourself or say something prior to the message you  actually want to give. One reason this accessory would be good to have is  if you needed to use your radio while both your hands were being used .like  riding  Manual LabourClimbing. as with the earbud you need to be able to  press the PTT button.,3,0,915
A19L4D1K8IKB9K,1517,I tried the ear bud while skiing recently and it work excellently. it is far more comfortable than i expected having read other reviews. The PTT mic is easy to use when clipped to the top of the collar of ski jackets  although if it becomes unclipped it is difficult to clip back on while  wearing ski gloves. A very good purchase.,4,1,331
A19LCBNZ2C0LL7,810,This machine has impressed me.  It has a large number of features thatmany other machines of its price range dont have.

For the current market of police radar detection it is above the norm.,4,1,291
A19TBA1WARJS55,0,I bought this product to use primarily for work. I log 3200+ mile a week and thought this would be a good to tool to have. I love the graphics. There were a few times that it routed me thru some residential areas and a couple of times I wondered if a truck was even legal at all. I loved the feature where I could see if there was a truck stop or rest area close by though it does not have them all. My main concern or problem with this device is in the charging port. The unit get to hot at this port. I went thru 3 12vlt chargers and 1 house wall charger. eventually the plug in had got to the point of being brittle and fell apart. I talk to Rand McNally about this they sent me 1 12 volt charger. But I had to pay for the rest and if I wanted them to look at it I would have to pay shipping out of my pocket. I have a problem with that because I paid so much for it to start. I had it about 2 mos. when it started having problems. I had it 10 mos. when it finally became useless and I thrrew it away. I replaced it with the rand Mcnally 510. Its a whole different animal with a whole lot more problems and will be taken back today.,2,0,1135
A19TX16EMZ3LI,0,What came was a 4 foot cable. and then a separate malemale 4 cable which is of absolutely no use to me.  I think they thought they could throw in a 2nd cable no one ever needs to make up for the wrong length of the one I did order.  No explanation. and the slip indicated as if they had actually sent the right item.  It also took a few WEEKS to get to me  came directly from China.  Not what I ordered.,1,0,403
A19TYKHJS7NX5N,1515,I first started out with a Palm V  I loved it. except for two annoyances  first. it would only handle 2 meg of RAM. and second. it would not allow any of the cool accessories you can get for the Palm.So. with much  hesitation I took the Palm V back and bought a Palm IIIx  I am very happy  I did! Now I have 8 meg of RAM on it. and I can hook all those exciting  gizmos like GPS receivers to it.If you are someone who just wants a  Palm device. go for the Palm V  but if you are a power user who wants  everything. do the IIIx  you will not regret it.,5,1,551
A19UZY5T33J0E7,55,I should have read the reviews before I ordered this piece of JUNK!  I followed the directions to the letter and got sound from the unit for about 20 seconds.... then nothing.

Just not sure why a reputable company like amazon.com continues to sell this item.....,1,0,410
A19WAVWO1YD18U,44,I bought this unit from Amazon about 2 months ago. and it still dosnt  work.

So I put on win98 machine same problem it dosnt play  it keeps sayng stop....I called tech support. andthey promied to send RMA  number to my email. they never did....their phone number makes you wait  forever. and nobody answers.....bad company. bad product.....,1,0,577

A19XMHRB3G4DIR,45,I purchased these with the intent of using for bird watching but they literally make me feel dizzy and green. No matter what I try. they just dont seem to provide a clear. distinct view. Seem abnormally darker than others Ive used and never give a crisp clear view. On the other hand. they are by far more ergonomic than the old ones I owned. feel great. solid. nice set...but wish Id kept my 30 year old set instead. Not good for bird watching. Cant begin to imagine for sports. Perhaps its my eyes? Unsure but they dont compare to 30 year old set.,2,0,549

A1A0KR4XZKXZD3,411,I purchased the 980 based on favorable product reviews.  The unit I received had defective suction cups. which seemed like a pretty simple problem to rectify.  When I called the company. they were not open during the stated hours and. when I finally did reach them. I was told that their warranty does not cover the suction cups.  It only covers the actual detector.  So. if you have a problem with mounting hardware. cables. etc.. that is your problem.  After I protested aggressively. they agreed to mail me a replacement suction cup too late to use the unit on my planned trip.  Needless to say. I am returning the unit.,1,0,623
A1A0L9PA8SW29D,719,Drove to a Barnes and Noble today.  The closest one to my house is 1 12 hours away.  I purchased my Nook.  I took it home. charged it for the 4 hours the store clerk suggested.  The problem came when I tried to register it so I can load up some ebooks.  I kept getting the error message that it cant connect. try again or call customer service.  After 5 attempts. I called customer service.  They were not surprised I couldnt register.  It seems that although the Nook is available for purchase in the stores. you cant register them due to serial number issues in their software.  Tech support doesnt feel this is information they need to pass onto the stores. so the stores have no idea.  So you have two choices. you can sit tight and wait for the problem to be rectified .btw  they have no idea when that will be.. or you can return the item to the store and order a new from ...... becuase those units can be registered no problem.  For some people this may be no problem. but I dont know when I will have the 3 hours and extra tank of gas to go to the store to return it.  Oh. but all is not lost. Barnes and Noble did say they were sorry.,1,0,1144

A1A35W25SQWXES,415,The cosmetics of the device are excellent. That is were the awesomeness ends. It is kind of clunky. the touch screen drags and it is a nightmare to interface.

A1A3PR3Z2BO8KH,2,Ive had numerous glitches since I bought this shortly after it came out.

A1A4OZVVUAOJ0Y,2732,First of all. I tried posting this review on bn.com. but they wont post because of inappropriate language!?!  .Or is it because I gave a bad review?.I have never in my life written a review for a product good or bad .even though I do a large amount of shopping online.. but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly. and I would like to warn others shopping for an ereader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision. My complains are. I experienced two major technical problems within 5 months of purchase. Technical support was clueless as to how to fix them. and instead suggested resetting andor replacing the entire unit. The replacement experience has taken over two months and 3 lengthy phone calls to customer service. and yet I still dont have a replacement.When I was shopping for an ereader this past summer. I originally was going to go with a Kindle since they have a better selection of cheap andor free ebooks. but at that time. only the Nook had Touch capabilities. which ultimately won me over.Everything was going great until the button for Settings no longer responded. which meant I could no longer turn on the wireless to download any other books. Technical Service had no idea how to fix it. so they walked me through resetting the entire device. deleting everything I already had on it. Then they suggested updating my software version to avoid problems in the future. Unfortunately. this completely crashed the Nook to the point that even the most drastic steps to do a full reset didnt work. They said that since it was under warranty they would ship me a replacement.It never came. I called back every 23 weeks for the past two months asking for an update. I got excuses like. they warehouse is busy. and you have to send yours back first .even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back..At this point. I dont even want it anymore. And even though the user manual says that you can get your money back if your device is found to be defective. I have been informed that this only happens if you return it during the first 14 days of ownership. Going as high up on the customer service ladder as possible. all they said is that I cannot get a refund. and a replacement should be coming soon.When and if it comes. I probably wont open it. I dont want to be reminded of this experience every time I pick it up. Im going to cut my losses. and go get myself a Kindle. I have dealt with Amazon customer service in the past and have extremely satisfied with them. Lesson learned.,1,0,2587

A1A8WCO6TR280O,0,...but if you have a Samsung Reality like me. this is not the card for you despite the description. It is great quality and works well. as I said. for removing photos from your phone. However. if you were wanting to leave it in your phone for extra memory. it does not stay in like SD cards usually do. I am always having a screen pop up to inform me that a SD has been removed and I have to click ok. I had to remove the photos from the card and store them back in the phone after putting them on the PC because every time it pops up it returns your screens and lock screens to defaults and you manually have to reset them. Since the card pops out several times a day that would not work for me. Simply opening my slider popped the SD card out a few moments ago...,2,0,765

A1AE23LJOTF6CN,3337,One reason I bought this CD was because of the rechareable battery feature.  What they dont tell you is in plain English is that you need special NiCd batteries.  It took me four stores and USD20 dollors later to  find them.  I bought the Radio Shack brand.  I put them in and naturally.  they dont work.  After a call to Panasonic. I find out you have to use  only Panasonic brand NiCD batteries which are available in about 10 stores  nationwide.  You have to order them through Panasonic for an additional  USD13.  Buy another brand that is designed with the consumer in mind and  parts that are widely available.,1,0,616

A1AHL90POX6J9K,33,Its a nice looking rig and it worked OK with a folding HT antenna affixed to the top.  I could barely get 2 miles range no matter what I did or how I configured it.  I used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and I used it in the car with an external roofmount antenna.  Both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles .verified during a test with a regular mobile CB on the other end..As I was tightening the external antenna connection to the radios jack. the radios jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack.  This was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldnt screw on more than 12 turn.  This is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of QC.I sent it back for a refund.  Spend another USD35 to get a fullsize name brand CB that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happier.,2,0,907

A1ANTXANHSLFO5,1414,I was looking for an inexpensive card that would let me play 3D games.  Didnt want to spent major USDUSDUSD for a top of the line card.  Did some research and decided on this one.  Installation was supereasy on my 333mhz  pentium.  I was up and going within 20 minutes.  Even the 2D is an  improvement over my previous 4MB card.  I would recommend this card if you  are in the market for a low cost 3D card and are not a supersuperserious  gamer that is only going to be satisfied with the top of the line.,4,1,506
A1AQ2WEXP2DTOS,1516,When I purchased this product. it was mainly for two reasons. The price combined with the digital tuning feature. I liked that it had the search feature and the preset stations. as opposed to the other cheap armband radios which merely had manual tuning. Well. the digital tuning is great. although somewhat awkward I frequently find myself hitting the wrong buttons as I jogwork out due to the tiny buttons. And whoever put the tiny u0026quotset stationu0026quot button next to the other preset station buttons deserves to be smacked around. I find myself accidentally hitting the u0026quotset stationu0026quot button. then screwing up my other presets. I live in Chicago. so there are dozens of radio stations. but I find the reception with the Koss PP257 is slightly below average. I pick up the megastations easily. but some of the less powerful .yet still local. stations fade in and out as I jog along. And if youre inside. forget about getting any stations unless your gymclub has good reception .It hasnt worked at several of the Bally Total Fitness gyms in Chicago.. I recommend asking people who wear armbands in your gym what kind of reception theyre getting first. My summary. I recommend for outdoor fitness if youre looking for an affordable armband radio. Do more research for indoor gyms or youre throwing your money away.,2,0,1338

It doesnt read any floppys.  to be sure I bought a box of NEW .preformatted. floppys. inserted one then several. but still got the same message. cant read the disk and need to format it. However it keeps on churning for quiet a time and then says it cant format the disk. This was repeated with several floppys. new and old alike and with other pcs. Desktops as well as laptops. All windows 7. Unfortunately was travelling when it arrived. so after 4 weeks when I tried to send it back. the return period had expired. And there seems to be no way to get Amazon to respond for this.,1,0,609
A1ARY4DE7I67BB,914,wont play inside my house and stay on 1 station. tuning knob wont let you set it at 1 station. about 3 come blasting thru. the volume switch is as poorly made too. you cant adjust the volume to the right setting.dont buy this. it looks good. but wont play inside. i have put an antenna on it to the outside. it didnt help. i havent taken the radio outside. the older radios were great radios. this is a cheap knockoff running on the old radios name.AMAZON is a great company. tho. this is just a bad product.shipping was great. packed right. just a bad ripoff from the people that owns the rights to the radio.sign me. displeased.dale maloney,1,0,642
A1ASTVG7VOPEJ4,0,All these are is colored velcro with a small piece of fuzzy on one side. I expected something a little more custom u0026 professional from Belkin.

A1ATYF0L0JNIZV,4343,This cable lets you connect your M315 to a PC and expand its capabilities  10 fold.The cable lets you use the proprietary Magellan DataSend CD to  customize your selection of worldwide builtin city. highway. airport.  tourist or marine database features.You can also link your GPS to PC  software like MS Streets u0026amp Trips etc to get realtime fullscreen  laptop street tracking and routeplanning.You can also hook up your GPS  to shareware software like OziExplorer and GPS Utility to do some serious  offroad trip planning using scanned topographical maps.Having said all  this it might have been wise to separate the power and PC cables which make  cable management a bit of a wrestling match in the car.But the bottom  line is that youre only halfusing your GPS if you cant hook it up to a  computer  and youre missing a lot of fun.,5,1,840
A1AU9W8HJTLOL0,6263,If you are looking for a base receiver which will support the needs of home theater now and in the future. this is it.  This unit has three key features that are an absolute must for home theater.performance and price  go without saying. 1.Dolby Digital u0026amp DTS  ready this is the main  reason to invest in home theater! 2. Full SVideo inputs for all components  Video switching can be cumbersome unless your receiver and all your  components use the same video inputoutputs .SVGA. RCA u0026amp RF..  Buy this  unit with the intention of connecting all your components via SVGA for ease  of operation and superb picture quality.  3. Digital Audio input Mapping  Sounds technical but it simply allows you to address the receiver optical  inputs to your match your equipment.  What all this means is that this  receiver has all the flexibility to support whatever components you have  today and any you decide to upgradeadd tomorrow.  I tried out two other  receivers before zeroing in on this one.The only downside.as also  mentioned by another reviewer.is that the unit is somewhat of a technical  challenge to master. JVC operation manuals tend to be a little brief and  cryptic in their explainations.  This one is better than most but you must  read the manual .probably more than once.when you set this unit up or it  will not function properly.  .e.g.. In addition to all the cabling. Dolby  Digital sound requires proper DVD IO mapping plus the DVD player must be  set to output the proper digital data stream..In all the units Ive  seen. this one is far and away the best equipped. and for the money. its an  obvious top choice.,5,1,1640
A1AULRXIQBC7JO,69,It worked great for the first two hours. but when I tried to open a book Id downloaded it froze up.  I restarted the Nook.  but the library and documents are blank. and it tells me I need to reregister.  When I try to register. it gives me a c7851 error. a customer service number. and then a blank screen.  I cant even view the books I bought.The biggest disappointment is Customer Service.  Ive called three times and they just keep saying theyre sorry. the system is in maintenance. and theres nothing they can do. I should call back later in the day.  Then I should call in back 24 hours.  Now I should call back in 2448 hours.Its going back tomorrow. and Ill get a Kindle.,1,0,677

The V has half the RAM of the IIIx. which. as a  seasoned pilot user. i know you will really want if you get into modems and  telnet shells and mail and realtime web browsing. .not to mention games.

A1AWXFMOX56DWM,12,I cant say enough good things about this tablet i love it. First off the screen is beautiful.Its vivid and the colors are great.The best for the price no doubt. Its even nicer than the nexus 7 screen.Tablet performance is good for a dual core tabletand the gpu is a good one sgx540 same as some of the ipads so games run pretty well.weight ergonomics and screen size are just right.The quality of this tablet is excellent. It also has Bluetooth which Manny tablets dont have in this price range.Personally i love the Ui Barnes and noble put on this table its nice. And now with Google play you have a gazillion apps to choose from.Battery life is also pretty good and WiFi works well.The tablet has 2 speakers and there decent pretty loud which is nice.I got mine on sale for 100.00 is worth every penny. I guess the only minor thing i found was it gets a little warm at times but thats typical of Manny tablets and phones.,5,1,923

A1AZIKNBR66K40,0,My first cover for my first nook. and I was not disappointed. It looks and feels great and the embossed clasp gives it a grownup vibe. The power button on the cover also lines up exact with the one on your nook. and the color coding leaves no doubly that it was made for the simple touch. Only problem I have with it is that the nook is only held on one side. Doesnt make too much sense because the nook has 2 other slots on the other side where theyd easily have had it held as well. This leaves the nook a little wobbly inside. nothing too worrying anyway. Id still recommend it.And. I got it for about USD2.5. so I cant complain at all!,4,1,639
A1B03LV6PO02V3,12,This is a review of the nook wifi. It is best purchased from an authorized dealer .Barnes u0026 Noble or Best Buy.. My nook cost USD150 from BB and the nook wifi3g costs USD200. Why pay more at an unauthorized dealer?Beware. many of the reviews here are out of date. Amazon has come out with the Kindle 3 and there has been another software update on the nook .1.5. so many of the issues here have long been resolved. I have had my nook for one month and read 4 books and listened to one book. So far no problems at all.The Kindle 3 has the latest eink screen technology .pearl. but then the nooks 1.5 software update increased contrast between letter and screen.  When I put a book next to my nook. the nooks screen is whiter and the contrast between text and page greater so the nooks screen is good enough for me. Very easy on the eyes to read but you need the proper reading light.Not that it matters. My decision to choose the nook was based on its ability to read library books something the Kindle cannot do. The experience of going online to my public library is akin to going online to a bookstore. A few minutes download time and its on the nook .first your computer then you sideload it from there to your nook.. They return themselves to the library afterward too. I love romance books but hate paying USD89 to read it once only to never read it again. Even the ebook romance price of USD6 is hard for some of us on a budget.Other benefits of the nook.The nook is cool. Yes. the Kindle was redesigned and is now about the same size as the nook but the nook still looks waaay more elegant.The nook has a smaller color touchscreen for navigation that also shows the covers of your books in color.I can buy books from stores other than Barnes and Noble.I can replace the battery myself.I can expand the memory if I want .nice if you like to listen to music while you read or use the nook to listen to podcasts or audio books..,5,1,1935
A1B0TT323PULKL,0,Didnt do anything. I ended up getting on YouTube to learn how to take the top off my VCR and clean the heads with paperrubbing alcohol.

It claims to be made of aluminium but in fact is very poor plastic with a bit of aluminium stuck on the front and back for decoration. THe allessential hinge is plastic.The description claims that the spring loading keeps the case tightly closed.  What it actually does is keep it slightly open.It claims to be half an inch thick but its more like three quarters of an inch thick. making the Palm in its case a much more bulky item in your pocket....,2,0,500

A1B4C6TN0LGA2V,22,The Maxell VP100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner did a great job in just seconds  less time than it said on the package. The video tape machine stopped running and produced a screen message that said the video heads needed to be cleaned. Knowing Maxell was a wellknown brand name.

A1B58SA5LY22VQ,4444,This little DVD player is the best possible thing one could have.  It fits perfectly anywhere you want it and fits into most overhead storage compartments.  There are several things that make this an excellent buy though.First of all. the quality of the picture is outstounding.  This  is almost as good as HDTV .High Definition Television. because you have a  crystal clear picture projected onto an LCD .Liquid Crystal Display.  screen.  Secondly. when it is output to a TV. the picture is just as good  as any other DVD player. but the bonus there is that this device is  extremely small. comapred to those large and bulky DVD players .sure they  cost less. but you cant take them on a seven hour flight from here to  England...There is also the controls and output.  The controls on this  DVD Player are quite easy to use.  Without looking at the instruction  manual. I was able to determain what a majority of the buttons did.  The  menus are quite accessible and manueverable due to a tiny  u0026quotjoysticku0026quot that allows you to swivel and pick your option.  However. there are also output controls as well.  The device uses  fiberoptic cables which therefore means that it can be connected directly  to a TV using the three wires .two sound. red and white. and video.  yellow..  When this is hooked up to a TV. the picture and sound quality is  unbelievable.Then the ironic question must be asked u0026quotwhy not just  use my DVD player on the computeru0026quot?  Well. of course if you have a  laptop the quality is fine. and of course. you can manage your budget while  watching a movie. put there are some good things to having a DVD player as  well.  If your want to play a DVD movie for your family. wouldnt you  rather have it on a TV screen than on a small LCD screen?  Of course. if  youre on an airplane and want to watch it there. you cant exactly display  it on the TVs there.  Thus. I can only say that one is not better than the  other.In conclusion. I can only say that this DVD player is quite ideal  because it is compact. pictureperfect. and can add whole lots of fun to  your life.,5,1,2115

A1B5Z5OG2NPFDT,23,I purchased two certified nook colors directly from Bu0026N. for my kids to read ebooks on. and for some entertainment on long trips. Drs appts. etc.Things I like about the device.versatility now has netflix great little device for entertainment. as well as reading.user interface.  much improved following the last update. both navigating the device itself and Bu0026Ns store.option for expandable storage handy for music and mp4s.ability to make the device kid friendly the internet can be disabled. and purchases can be made to require your account password.Things I dislike about the device.Read in store feature only for certain books. and virtually no kids books.  The impression I got from Bu0026Ns webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable. and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot. and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable. so not a huge deal. but I expected better quality...  Also. the power adapter is quite bulky.did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update .allowing me to disable internet. and install netflix.. it was relatively easy to do. following directions from Bu0026Ns webpage. but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.no free games u0026 limited games .maybe apple spoiled me....prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle .I have not made direct comparisons. this is just my general impression.I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library this may allow me to use it more for its intended purpose.Overall. the device itself is quite good just not for what I had intended it for .in store reading with the option to purchase the book. in print. from the store..If I had purchased the device for myself. however. it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it. playing angry birds. watching netflix. etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit.The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact Bu0026N .I initially took my nooks into a Bu0026N store for assistance. and was referred to their tech support 1800 number.  So much for the in store tech support....  I was able to recieve two new cables under warranty. though.I am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone. but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable. and the inability of Bu0026N to solve this issue instore.,3,0,2760

A1B8M49XXSULN4,1515,This is one of the best radar detectors Ive ever owned.  The city filtering mode works great. with little false alarms.  Its easy to understand and operate. and best of all it does a great job of letting you  know of any threats.  Personally. the voice alert is so annoying I just  leave if off. because when it detects something and it cuts off and detects  it again. the voice alert message repeats over and over again!

I read all of the other reviews about people  having problems with the battery lid and it freezing up and things like  that. well diamond has fixed all of those problems. The battery lid stays  on fine. and there have been no freezing problems.

My only problem is that after awhile the ear pads start to bother my ears and I have to take them off. It would be nice if there was an adjustment not only for size. but for width. It would also be nice if there was a little padding at the top. Otherwise they are good for the price and they are not big and bulky. which was why I bought them in the first place.,4,1,448

A1BDZE0TP6L492,0,I bought the original nook in Aug. 2010. Initially. I liked it. but I quickly learned that the battery life wasnt nearly the quoted time .it lasts about 2 days for me. 3 max with wireless off and the most powersaving settings.. The einklcd screen mix was nice for navigation. although I understand that the newer touch models will be more batteryefficient. Despite this drawback. it was so much more convenient than paperbacks. As much as I love the feel of books. in a NYC apartment. there just isnt all that much room for them!That nook lived for about 9 months until a part of the screen died  just black pixels. I called customer service and after a long painful process. got it replaced. The unit I got was clearly a refurbished unit. which wouldnt have bothered me. had it been identical to the one I sent it. My original nook had a twopart screen. this new nook had a onepart screen and its buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened. this squeaking. which made the buttons difficult to press. also caused the pageturn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say. I wasnt delighted. Apparently. the pageturn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook. remember this. if the button squeaks and is hard to press. it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this .my old one wasnt.. so I recommend checking it out.Overall  35  its a solid reading device but doesnt really compare to the newgeneration nook simple touchkindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard .which I now also own..,3,0,1642
A1BEL2K2WY2Y0D,6064,I was suprised at the good quality this small camera will produce. It is very easy to use for beginners. Takes excellent still photos.

A1BGNR13XBLP3T,0,When I bought a new computer. of course it did not come with a floppy drive. This fits my need for reading all the floppy disks I have stored information on over the years. Plays nicely with Windows 7 and. thank heavens. the software I have installed on the computer. Overall I am happy with the drive except for the cord is very short so I had to be creative in the placement of the drive since my desktop computer is housed in a small computer desk.  This is the only negative and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. This would work really well with a laptop.,4,1,562

I tried several disks and all sound horrible and never reads a disc. but will read fine in other readers. Read all the bad reviews and you can see getting this drive. you are taking a big gamble. I bought this because of all the good reviews. but beware. it looks like Amazon combines reviews from other brands because if you read one review that got 5 starts it says it is for the Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive .FLUDRV. like what I bought . but in the review the customer wrote  Works as advertised. a Teac drive. one of the best brands around over the years.

A1BLMF5T8U07DZ,1414,I generally listen to music in two ways.1. Turn the volume down low so I could pick every nuance of the music and let my soul blend in with the tune.This set delivers relatively well when you prefer u0026quotquiet musicu0026quot. The bass can still be gently felt even at very low volumes. But the very high frequencies seem to be rather muted.  My solution is to pair a pair of PC Works tweeters in the front and place the two tweeters from this 3piece speaker in the back. The PC Works tweeters seem to render crisper high frequencies compared to this set.The resulting surround sound effect is extremely pleasing. Considering that you can get a set of PC Works for USD50. its worth the extra money.The Yamaha speakers. unlike other PC speakers. has a broad listening range. You could be a fair distance away from your computer doing other stuff and still enjoy the music.2. Turn the volume so high that my liver turns black by the booming bass.The bass for this speaker set wouldnt disappoint even its harshest critics. The subwoofer could fill the entire room with the volume halfway up. I usually turn the volume to half its maximum when I want to listen to loud music. and its LOUD at that level. The sound nevertheless becomes somewhat distorted after you turn it over three quarter to the maximum. Unless you want to die a deaf man. though. you should not try listening music at such a high volume.The sound this set of speakers deliver is sweet given its price point. The rebate also came back to me after a 3 week waiting period. which is fast for PC rebates. I find this to be the best USD100 I spent on PC equipment since the time I purchased my Voodoo 1 card .Yep. I got a deal back then for the real stuff.. You wont be disappointed.,5,1,1747

The  TRV510 is a great way of getting a 640x480 digital camera and a digital  camcorder in one device!The only problem. of course. is that Amazon  doesnt .yet. sell the TRV510...,4,1,683

Those read were placed in created Shelf A or Shelf C. depending on whether I liked it or not. Everything was working fine until they did a recent update and then it was like a tornado was let in. Locked up my Nook until I downloaded the update and then found all my shelves gone and books missing from my library. Called BNshelves gone and will have to create again plus move read books back into and missing books from library have to be downloaded again. One book was not found and after an hour on the phone. BN said the publisher stopped making it available for the Nook .is available for the Kindle. and will issue a refund. Fortunately I kept the email confirmations of all books I ordered so I could give them the order number.Customer service is lacking at BN. I had to make multiple calls until I was finally put in touch with someone who could solve the problem of the missing book.One other thingupdate seems to have changed screen brightness as before I could read it out by the pool and now I no longer can.In fairness. I will also mention that I have a Kindle paperwhite and an update wiped out my created collections. but didnt lose any books and can still read it out by the pool.Both have WiFi and that may be an inherent problem with updating through it as far as shelvescollections go.,3,0,1444
A1BOMQF7QOSEYA,22,It was very difficult to try and make it work. Could not download and purchase books.Product bought 41413 and tried to return 51013. Claim denied because expirationdate passed for return. Wasnt even a month.,1,0,207
A1BPI9PFTU2AK6,1516,For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews. I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.  Turns out I made a great decision! I used to be a strict physical book junkie. but now I enjoy reading both my nook and regular books.  The thing that gets me is that I can bring it practically EVERYWHERE .in the car. doctors office. rather than bringing my huge hardcover books.  Its really a wonderful product.Heres some highlights that won me over .before and after..After I charged my nook for the first time. the battery lasted about a month before dying. which is really great!Light. nice grip to holdLOVE the touch screen! When Im at the gym I just tap on the screen and its so much easier to read than holding pages on a real book .which I dont mind either.Format of the books are awesome. I love how you can see the covers.flashes EVERY SIX PAGES!! this feature made the biggest impact on my decision.  I absolutely hated how the kindle flashed on every page.  Huge turnoff for my reading experience.Things that arent so good.Touch screen freezes randomly .ie. when I accidently highlight something....but it doesnt happen very often.  Im not that upset because all I have to do is reboot it and then it works perfectly again.  Im expecting the system updates will solve that in the near future. Im pretty sure they are working on it right now!ebooks are the same price .sometimes more. than a physical book.UPDATE .21912.nook update fixed the freezing!! my nook has been performing beautifully since my purchase in august!! .. i am a happy reader! GET THIS INSTEAD OF THE KINDLE! my friend has the kindle touch and its way too unorganized.  I love my nook because it still has buttons for those people who cant entirely adjust to an all touch screen device.  For some reason buttons make me feel very comfortable. but I do however use the touch screen every once in a while.  You dont get that luxury with the kindle! I LOVE MY NOOK! After playing around with my friends kindle .she got it last month.. it just reminded me that I made the right decision. yay nook!!some advice..BUY A CASE OFF AMAZON! I got one for like 16 bucks and its the best case Ive ever had.Purchase the nook in best buy. They have extended warranties and they are great on customer service. Or you dont have to. Your choice.So. all I have to say is... I LOVE MY NOOK! It makes me want to read more books because theyre so accesible! At first. I was worried I wasted money. but this is truly a fine product. I really cant wait to grow old with it.hope this helps!  happy reading!,5,1,2665
A1BPJ9ESU7BWR7,11,Yeah. these are just what you expect. cheap. plastic trays for DVDs or CDs. and are suitable for that purpose.One thing. though. They are NOT 7.2 inches in height as specified. Theyre a full 8 inches tall. So. if you planned on stacking them .as I did. in a space just over 15 inches. they wont fit.This seems a simple enough thing for them to get right.,1,0,354
A1BPRRT5QIKU8J,1923,It works clean and prefect. What else can be said but get it.,5,0,61
A1BQD84WXZ2DIQ,0,I really loved how this phone case looked because all of the other phone cases for my phone had hearts and flowers on it. I knew it came with a belt clip .which I do not plan on using. but I didnt think there would be a hole in the back. You couldnt really see it in the picture. But it doesnt stick out too bad. One other thing is that the side of my case doesnt seal all the way so whenever I touch it. it makes a popping noise.,4,1,430
A1BQN95IAGAZGJ,0,I really like this shower radio. the stations come in very clearly. Its easy to use. too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is that the buttons are on top. My shower is in a claw foot tub. with a wrap around curtain. The only place to hang the radio is on the curtain rod. so this means its up high. This makes the buttons a little hard to get to. Luckily. I know which ones are which without looking. but it would have been a better design if the buttons were on the front. If you have a little shelf or something to put it on. youll be better off. and really. my complaint is minor. The sound is worth the trouble.,4,1,625
A1BQO3TF4GXWDN,22,Got this drive for an original iMac back in the winter of 1998.  It worked just fine until 2002 when the eject function stopped working and it wouldnt accept any disks.  It wasnt worth going through the trouble to get fixed. so a new model was purchased.,4,1,254
A1BRMCJGK6CGLF,57,This review is for the Advent AW720. Dont buy it.1. Very weak battery life.According to the manual. it takes 12 hours to completely charge the NiCd battery and a completely charged battery yields 4 hours of playtime. 124 is unacceptable. The weakest of Sony headphones have batteries that charge for 24 hours but yield 30 hours playtime. So if you charge the weakest Sony headphone battery for 12 hours. you get 15 hours. or 3 times the charge! Thats more like it! The Advent battery makes you feel limited and I dont like feeling limited. Second. this may sound silly. it costs you to charge the headphones. If I didnt live in a dorm. Id care! Those nickels can add up!2. Poor clarity for anything except music .no dvd. videos. etc..Really. when Im not using my headphones. I always have them charging! I always start off with 100% charged battery. And I play around with tuning knobs on both the headphone and the base. I do everything yet I cannot get rid of the u0026quotaudio scratchesu0026quot when watching a DVD on tv or watching a video on my computer. True. the careful tuning can get rid of the u0026quothissu0026quot but the u0026quotaudio scratchesu0026quot will be there at least every ten seconds no matter what you do when using the headphones for anything but music.I tried to use the u0026quotspecial connectionu0026quot .for my dvd player.that they give you rather than the typical headphone jack connection. Batteries were 75% charged. As usual. with proper tuning. the hiss was gone. But the u0026quotaudio scratchesu0026quot stayed! Those scratches totally ruin your movie watching experience! Second. I had to crawl down. disconnect the tv audio input nad then connect the headphone input to the dvd. When I finished trying to use the headphone. I had to crawl done again. disconnect and reconnect the tv audio. Who wants to go through that trouble for a u0026quotspecial connectionu0026quot that doesnt really work? And how is it even possible if the battery is so weak that after half way through the movie it is signifcantly uncharged? Pathetic!That being said. the sound quality of this headphone is great for music from my computer. No doubt about it. There are very few u0026quotaudio scratchesu0026quot there and with proper tuning the hiss will go down. Also. contrary to some reports. these headphones can be very. very loud indeed without being harsh!3. Not very durable .then again. how many are?.Close to the ear cup. there is a strip that is very easy to wear and tear. The ear cups themselves are of hollow plastic .although this is OK.. Every time I put on the headphone. I feel afraid to break that part. Even the ear cups are poorly connected to the stem .this doesnt seem to be trouble.. I admit it is easy to reinforce that weak area near the cup with duck tape and it wont trouble you at all. but who wants that! But then again. how many durable headphones are there? I wouldnt put my money on the RCA 160 Whip or whatever. Im sure you can find something better anyway.4. Range is very good!I live in a dorm where there are thick walls. I can get out of my room and up to 30 .not 300. feet in the hallway and I can listen to music with no trouble. Hey. thats not bad is it. considering the fact that some headphones promise only up to 24 .of course. you know what they promise isnt the same as it really is. so factor that in.. I still think 30 feet near thick walls is very impressive. And Ill bet that if it was a more open area. Id get even better range. Impressive for that and probably top notch!Conclusion.Dont buy it. The battery is unacceptable. Very limited play time. And you are limited only to music. You cant watch movies or videos or watch tv with this headphone! Oh no you cant. not without getting an annoying u0026quotaudio scratchu0026quot every the seconds even if the battery if fully charged and you use the optimum connection they tell you on DVD! And that is unacceptable because it ruins your movie experience!I paid 17 dollars for these headphones right here at amazon .I hear the current price is 64!.. Id say you cap your price to 40 dollars .be patient. therell be some merchant selling for a 40 dollars or less. and buy a Sony. I hear that even the Sonys are very poor. but at least you get a stronger battery?Good luck.,2,0,4292
A1BS4FN1OFY85M,1313,This camera certainly lives up to the manufacturers claims of ruggedness! On my recent 2 month trip to Costa Rica it survived numerous soakings and a fall from our rental dirt bike at 30 kmhr with barely a scratch and performs no differently from before. On a day to day basis Ive been carrying it around in the bottom of my rucksack for about 8 months now .minus its case. which I long since lost.and besides some of the writing wearing off. its still as good as ever. People are always remarking about the quality of my pictures too  I am never disappointed with a single set of pictures I get back! Bright colours. accurate framing and I particularly like the fact that it shuts off the flash even if you leave the switch on so you dont kill the batteries. One 3V battery lasted over a year! The only trouble with that is its hard to catch that critical moment when using your flash because it takes a second or two to charge the flash after you press the button. Otherwise Its the absolute perfect camera for anyone who has been chastised their entire lives for not respecting their belongings!,5,1,1098
A1BS7GSINYRK5V,1,Initially. the microphone didnt work. This turned out to be due to my sound card .Sound Blaster. wanting a stereo plug for the microphone. but the headset comes with a mono one. I work around this by plugging in the  mike only part way I should replace the plug eventually. The headset is  very lite. and the mike sensitive.  It seems that the boom should be a bit  longer. but it does pick up my voice well enough.,4,1,415
A1BSGCH0E0RMNC,35,Do not do not do not waste your time.  This product is horrible.  No wonder it is so cheap.  It does not work.  It plugs in fine.  You put a disk in you can hear it spinning and all you get is. insert a disk into drive d.  No matter what type you put in Cd  nope.  DVD  nope.  None of them work.  Dont waste your time.  I immediately threw it into the trash.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE product.,1,0,395
A1BTRL4DEI1HJ2,216,Went to Best Buy and bought the Nook. could not wait to get home with it. After about 3 hours of charging it up. Went to register it and start getting books and it froze up permanently. Not happy at all. so back to the store it went. thinking about trying the Kendle. if I can find one at my local Target. Cant give much of a review. but just wanted you to know.,1,0,362
A1BU254S0LGU9V,0,It does not work well.it does not work me in the car. my BB TORCH 9800 it does not recognize. it says it that she cannot load the battery with that power plant.do not throw your money awey on this produt!,1,0,204
A1BUZQKA4P36Z0,11,It was working quite wonderfully for about 45 days then it just croaked. It started giving errors that EVERY single floppy was  write protected . I attempted to contact Amazon customer support but they only do refunds on it up to 30 days.Im guessing that the write protect sensor on the inside failed.,1,0,301
A1BXD9S3N7K6WE,0,I bought this for my new Nokia C101 which I had ordered from amazon too. But. the cable doesnt work without a memory card whereas the description didnt say that at all. Or I would not have bought it. My system doesnt read the device when I connect the data cable to my cell and plug it in. If at least the product description had said that a memory card was required. I would not have wasted USD 10.00 on this. ..,1,0,413
A1BZ18U2EF4FAI,47,I got one of these for Christmas. and I LOVE it! At first I wasnt all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store. but recently they had an update that added all sorts of Google apps. including Google Playstore. It has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets. It is great to read with. but the books are a little pricey.Now that it has Google Playstore and great graphics. I cant think of a reason for somebody NOT to get it!,5,1,479
A1BZ18U2EF4FAI,33,Purchased the Nook Color over a month ago.  I have been reading alot more since I got it . as its so convenient to take everywhere.  I have not had any issues reading in the car on sunny days.  I also like the ability to read at night in my bed without any lights on. thus minimizing chances of waking up the wife.  The screen is very sharp and easy to read.  Magazines look awesome on the Nook Color and its so much more convenient than having a stack of magazines clutter up the house.  I do not think it would be easy to read on the beach under direct sunlight. but it will be fine if you are under an umbrella .which is what I do when at the beach. as Im cancer phobic.. Wifi connection is automatic . seamless.  The web browser is better than I expected  and I use it often to read online newspapers and check email .way better than the Kindles browser..There is to be a sofware upgrade in the next month or so which will enhance the NC even more.  Or you can root it yourself to turn it into a full blown tablet .at half the price of the Galaxy tablet!.The only drawback is the weight of the NC  it weights about the same as a hard cover book .though easier to hold than a hard cover book..,5,1,1196
A1BZNW65EXP0XW,0,I ordered two speakers one worked the other did for about 30 seconds.  Amazon was quick to process the return and credit. I wouldnt recommend these if you are looking for high end acoustics. but they do the job if you arent picky.,3,0,230

A1C13JC74DX9LN,33,This head cleaner damaged my VCR and did not WORK !!! Would not buy again !! My VCR now has a blurry picture that does not clear up nor goes away.,1,0,146
A1C1SR200MSJUM,0,I recently rigged up a treadmill workstation in my office and wanted to find a mount for my monitor so that I wasnt craning my neck downward toward my laptop when walking and working.  I researched a number of articulating arms and selected this one because of the reviews and the length of the arm itself.As other reviews have noted. the product is constructed of solid materials.  While heavy. it was easily installed by my organizations maintenance staff.  One downside to this product is that while the arm length and location is fairly easy to adjust. I have not been able to easily adjust the pitch of the monitor .angle of the monitor face relative to the ground..  Thankfully when installed it was at an appropriate level for my use and is not a big issue. Another very slight issue is that the arm has the slightest wiggle to it. so that. when the arm is fully extended the monitor is slightly off level.  This may be more an issue of installation than product. however.On the whole. Im very pleased with the product. particularly at the price that I paid for it.,4,1,1072
A1C1T83YTXLLBY,0,I still record things using VHS. and I needed a head cleaner.  I chose this one because it reminded me of something I used years ago.  I like it...I could probably say I love it. but the reason I didnt is because I had to run the cleaner through 34 cycles to ensure the VCR was clean....and that could be because of the length of time in between cleanings.  Overall. good product,4,1,379
A1C2GEDBG86BCS,0,Good device when it was new now so old that my new Dell computer will not accept down load installation. Have returned product to seller. .,1,0,139
A1C2XX97W0L7DY,0,The need was clear...capture those old photos that had never been printed from an old computer and transfer to a newer one. It did the job. although twice it locked up the new computer. Exiting and rebooting those two times made everything work great again.,4,1,257
A1C3GBXTS7GX5T,0,When I decided to buy my first digital camera. my wife and I ordered this one.  We got it home. and the display on the back never worked right. so we ended up packing it up and returning it. Ended up getting an HP PhotoSmart C200 instead. and Ive never regretted the decision.,1,0,276
A1C44IUJIM4ZQW,33,Good tabletereader until..... 1.4.1 upgrade last week. I am returning it and paying a little more for a real tablet and downloading nook app.,1,0,141
A1C4BMQQXOQD80,0,This wall mount is super affordable! I purchased 2. 1 for my room. 1 for the family room. The family room installed with no issues. The one in the bedroom had a small issue. we had to cut 2 in off the bottom legs to make it fit. These mounts are very adjustable and function well.,4,1,280
A1C55HT82Y70AE,0,Great  . easy to install and very solid product good quality. I will recommend this for sure .  Get it !,4,1,104
A1C6C1Q3FVVU6A,12,I actually throw it away and bought a Palm product. Dont bother buying it.,1,0,74
A1C6VL5YD7ISGG,2236,My nook froze within a few days. as the user guide is ON THE NOOK I had to go to the internet to find info on what to do.  I was directed to the online nook user guide .on B+N.com. which told me to remove the back cover and unplug the battery for a hard reboot.  It didnt work and after an hour with a worthless tech support agent Im informed that those directions are for the original nook. and that I will need to get a brand new one.  Best yet.... Removing the cover has now voided my warranty!! Quite simply the worst customer service experience I have ever had. although the nook was fun to use for the ~48 hours it worked.,1,0,628
A1C8RTQ6II59ZK,45,ive had this keyboard for 4 years now. and it is still working perfectly.  i have even spilled a little bit of water. and maybe a little bit of soda on it and it still works great.  ITS SPILL RESISTENT!  dont spend 40 dollars on a keyboard when you can buy the same quality bourd for only 10.,5,1,292
A1C9DXCM6QF5XQ,22,This is a great wall mount.  I have installed three others and I like this the best.  It extends enough with the second arm so that you can mount a large TV so that it fits in the corner of a room.  The TV will hide the actual wall mount and arms mounting to the back of the TV.  This one was installed thru a plaster drywall into cinder block wall.  I used  the 2 wall anchors and bolts provided in the mounting accessory pack.  The 42  TV bolt pattern fit the mounting plate so I did not have to use the adjustable arms provided in the package.  Total installation time was less than 20 minutes.  I like the fact that you can tilt it. rotate it .makes it easy to get the TV level.  and move it in and out a great distance and it will go back pretty flush to the wall.  The instructions are easy to follow.  Overall. I think this is a sturdy mount that will confidently hold a large screen TV and it does not look like a massive mount like some do.,5,1,949
A1CA4MJ6U09EQU,33,Excellent product. A valuable source of weather information for people in rural areas. Alerts are at least 24 minutes ahead of any television or radio announcements.,5,0,165
A1CAGW0HRGS2EZ,0,It shipped out very quickly .2 days or so.. After opening it and plugging it in my Garmin. I realized after 30 minutes or so it wasnt charging at all. My Garmin still charged in my car so I reasoned I had been sent a defective product.,1,0,235
A1CAL36PFWCOC1,810,Its pretty sad when you have over USD5.000 worth of HDTV equipment and Im depending on a USD29 antenna to pick up my local HDTV channels. but it WORKS!I use a satelitte for my reception. but I need an antenna to pick up my local channels in HDTV.  I purchased a TERK TV 50 .USD129. with all kinds of raves and reviews and it was a complete waist of time.  Im now back to the ANT 200.  My only compliants are VHF doesnt come in strong. UHF is OK and it doesnt look that great sitting on top of my 53u0026quot TV.  However. it pulls in 6585% on the HDTV signal and thats more than enough to lock in the signal .with HDTV. you either get the signal or you dont. theres no inbetween like analog. and that was its whole purpose.  I may stick it up in the attack and then the reception for EVERYTHING should be great!,4,1,811
A1CAM461PYJBH1,2327,This kit is worth the money.  It is compact and stores easily in the bag included with the kit. In turn. the bag stores easily in a laptop briefcase.  The instruction booklet leaves a little to be desired.  But the  product itself is much smaller than the cradle. and much easier to store.  It is easy to use.  The charger comes in handy. and the multiple adapters  need be carried only for the countries in which one travels.  Definitely  worth the investment.,5,1,461
A1CAM8B71TKZ85,5,This item looks cool.I really want to buy it BUT... how would i get this onto my computer?Does it have flash or some kind of memory stick? Does it come with an adapter?

A1CB67LM04OIIL,3539,This walkman is awesome!  Its sound is unmatched!  The headphones are really cool!  The only problem with it is that the radio stations do not  play very well.

A1CDSJ18J7QVXZ,44,I read a lot of what other people have been saying about the diamond rio.  For the most part. the reviews have been good. but when they werent good. they were BAD.  I dont understand how someone can complain about the rio  just because they cant install it on their computer. or they didnt look  at the computer requirements.  Or if they mistreated it...  The sound  quality on this is excellent.  For those people who said it is NEVER cd  quality sound could never be more wrong.  The Diamond rio can actually be  above cd quality sound. depending on the speed of your encoder.  I was  almost completely satisfied with the Diamond Rio. but the 30 minutes of  sound it could hold werent quite enough. maybe if it just had 45 minutes.  I didnt want to buy a memory card for it because theyre about USD100. and  it reduces the sound quality by 50%.  I bought this mp3 player last summer.  and i still have it in one piece.  Ive dropped it a few times. and had to  make simple repairs. but ive never had to do anything that actually cost  me money.  There are better mp3 players out there now. like the diamond rio  500. and some nomad ones. but theyre probably considerably more expensive.  The diamond rio is a bit fragile. and if you drop it. then it will skip.  because the battery could be knocked out of place.  But as long as youre  fairly careful. itll stay in one piece.  Ive been biking with mine.  skateboarding. through the airport. etc...  and as i said before. it still  works.  You might want to shoot for the diamond rio 500. but the price on  this baby is killer.  The only thing that beats an mp3 player. sadly. is a  minidisc player. mainly because you can bring your songs with you. and many  other reasons. but im not going to go into that ^_^  the bottom line is.  if you want a VERY small mp3 player which holds FREE downloadable music  from the internet which works on fairly new computer. and is fairly  durable. go for this one!,4,1,1951
A1CE42YCMQ3FEX,1,Good movement options. but VERY tightstiff.  Hoping it will get a little easier with time and be less awkward to adjust.  Good deal for the price it seems so far.,4,1,162
A1CEA1CUR124EF,33,I use it with my allinone printerfaxscanercopier to connect the fax to the phone jack in a different room.  I like it. it works just fine for me.,4,0,145

A1CF0FFI4FRT78,7285,I have been trying to find faults with my IIIX since I bought it three months ago. and still cannot. Every time I think I have found something I dont like I consult the manual and my solution is in black and white. Next  thay need to have voice activation so it will type while you talk and I  dont have to write while driving. As good as this product is it wont be  long.,5,1,372
A1CF0NG978E3MI,0,actually I purchased these as part of a birthday gift. along with a television. The person had a VHS recorder and no DVD.He  as well as I am very HAPPY with the maxell tapes. Infact they were an added bonus to the original gift.VHS tapes are very difficult to purchase now a days anywaythis was very easy. to just check online and order.When we get close to using up all 24 tapes that were ordered. I will reorder once againthank you,5,1,433
A1CG9YZSORJEO9,0,I took one picture and it worked fine. but ceased functioning after that. I downloaded the picture to my desktop.,2,0,113
A1CGJTHXWVD9G0,0,I really liked the looping which meant I did not have to turn the tape and the sound quality was alright too. But eventually the cassette player simple stopped working. It just wouldnt play anymore tapes no matter what batteries I put in... I have yet to find the ultimate cassette player. This is certainly one of the best Ive tried. but none of them seem to last long .,3,0,371
A1CGQYGQUIO626,0,I squashed my first nook in a rucksack and the screen though not cracked was ruined for making coherent text. They ought to be waterproof and strong enough to drive a truck over maybe. I liked the ability to carry a portable library around on a bike to better pursue scholarship outside academia and the political correctness of the ultraestablishment people against liberty. property and internet publishing liberty for differing opinion.,4,1,439
A1CHHXYG1YFQLW,99,Like all sound systems. the value of this system depends on what you want to do.  If you want a to enjoy music on a boat. trip. or on your computer without tinny and pathetic sound. then the PC Works sub+sat is perfect.  it runs on relatively little power. and for that amount of power. pounds.  its bass setting in the back lets you set it to whatever you want and forget about it.  the volume control is easy to use. and lets you set your computers volume to a default and forget it as well.  the super long cords for the satellites allow for a lot of flexibility in placement. for sound itself. the little baby can really pound and sounds very clean.  it can sound tinny at times. and is most definately not going to compete with a pair of Klipschs any time soon.  however. for around thew same price. you WILL be hard pressed to find better.  just dont expect miracles out of it and you will be most pleased. if you can. i would recommend going for the moreexpensive Sound Works Digital. also by CSW.  it features a larger subwoofer and sats. and just sounds sharper and provides more boom in the bass.  it is slightly more expensive. but you pay for what you get. in all. if you keep an open mind. and do not get too excited by the hype on the box. you will enjoy the CSW100s.,4,1,1281
A1CI7ZYFEABEI,0,I have used this Maxell product for yearsmodel VP100. item 290058. and have been very pleased with the performance.  It kept my VCRs all running great. and I use them a lot.Until now.  I looked for it to reorder. noticed it did not look quite the same on the product page. but it was Maxell and the model and item number were the same as those I had purchased in the past.  So. I figured it was an updated packaging.  And when reviewing my past orders with Amazon. to assure that I was getting the same product. this was the link it came up with for my previous purchases.  Oh. and the product info said discontinued by the manufacturer. so I thought Amazon had a surplus still to sell.WRONG WRONG WRONG.This is like a cheap flea market knock off. even though the box says Maxell and all the numbers match.  The older cleaner tape had onscreen instructions. guided you through the process with graphics .you know. the one with the water streaming out of the tv and the fish swimming around. and audio .first. your audio check. etc... and it ran for around 90 seconds.This piece of junk says to run it for 20 seconds.  It does not run for for 20 seconds. maybe 10. then automatically rewinds itself.  And for those fleeting seconds. there is a blank blue screen and no audio.  I bought three of these.  My JVC ran it for 10 seconds. then rewound automatically. ejected the tape and turned itself off. The Panasonic VCR ate the tape and will not give it up.  I have not tried the third tape I bought .based on disgust..DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Look elsewhere.  This is a total rip off!And. yeah. Im POd.,1,0,1600

A1CM0PCB8JLU21,3439,We purchased this camera to replace a Fuji that I had had for years.  The camera seemed comfortable. easy to use. had a longerrange zoom than most in the price range and had the features we wanted.  We are very happy with  the camera overall. however. my only complaint is that it is a little noisy  for the zoom and the camera casing feels a little u0026quotcheapu0026quot. not as  sturdy as the fuji.  Overall. the pictures are wonderful and we are very  happy with our decision  much happier than we were with the Fuji.,4,1,522
A1CM4TU9WCMIH7,66,I got a Jornada for my local group of the Emergency Communations as we can keep track of units by APRS .Automatic Position Reporting System. it allows the Net Control .NC. to keep track of everyone without having to ask over the air. I have the same program on the palm but the screen is so small and I have a greyscale one that the priority messages that arrive in color I cant see. The Jornada has solved all of that. The nice thing about the unit as its color and it has a real keyboard that I can type on whereas the plam did not. Also the keyboard on the palm would cut out if there was new traffic and I was typing a message. another nice plus is that I can run the unit off of 12VDC with a portable printer. the radio. and the GPS all in the car if need be. I have had this unit for about six months now and love it. The possibilities of the rig are unmatched.Cameron SummerhawkN0WRE Emergency Communications,4,1,915

A1CN4OPYWXQP1K,11,Excellent product for travel and other type usage.  It easily fits in my glove box or coat pocket.  I am pleased with this product thus far. It has good sound and clarity. Many different options on the unit are available however. when in a vehicle an adapter should be included to securely hang in the vehicle. The belt clip is good but not when using inside the vehicle. I would recommend this product for purchase.,4,1,416

A1CR2JMX5LDA0M,1418,Hi. I am a media technician in local high school in Silicon Valley.  We have different kind of video editing base from linear to nonlinear.  On nonlinear we have three different level video editing system.  We got IMovies. ReelTime. Studio DC+. and Studio DV.  Each one of them help  students the different need on their video project.  As a media technician.  I have to understand their need in order to help them complete the project.  As a beginer. I tend to teach them on Studio DV because the students are  easlier to understand what is the video edit about.  I dont mean the other  product no a good choice. but Studio DV give student all the need for their  project. From capturing. editing. and make movies. the students tend to  understand very fast.  Also. I did ask the student how they rate this  product.  This is what they told me.1. Friendly user interface 2. Allow  them to see the visual on the timeline 3. Allow them to do as many trim  until it looks the way they  want. 4. Good title creater and overlay. 5.  Good number of transition to add bettween the video and title. 6. Good  sound effect and music selection if you dont have your  own sound effect  and music. 7. Allow them to choice different video format and help them to  share their idea and story to the internet by using  realplayer.  8. It  is a good beginer video editing hardware and software.In conclusion as a  media technician to teach a students or teachers who have no experience  what is video editing. it very hard with limited time they have.  However.  the Studio DV allows me to show them many different ways to get their video  project look outstand which is a good thing for both side.  I will say the  Studio DV is very good for all level user.  Remember what  you pay is what  you get. Beside .it i inexpensive. to get the hardware and the software with this  performent.  I dont see it yet from the market.  I hope this can help all  the newcomer video editing.,5,1,1961
A1CRFGAFSIBC0E,33,Good product for using to record surveillance around the house. 8 hours better than 6 hours. Saves time and money.,4,0,114
A1CS6R7QEF3CSY,2223,In contrast to another reviewer. I found this TV to have far superior reception to any of the Sony and Casio models I looked at in the stores. I bought it and have been extremely happy with it. The screen is a pleasure  to look at. the sound is remarkably good for such a small unit. and it is  very well built. again in contrast to the other manufacturers models.,5,1,364
A1CSL6JUGUR6W8,1115,The rio 300 was great. untill i broke it.......twice!  The first time it broke was for NO apparent reason. which is never a good. I thought it was just a defect. untill 2 weeks of constant jarring and crushing in my  backpack proved otherwise. The front plate was completly torn off. It did  look a little flimsy and weak. So if your a high school student. just  trying to keep up with the ever changing music fads. wait untill one of the  other. stonger Mp3 players drops in price. because it just wont last in  your backpack! For this imperfection. I give the Rio pmp300 TWO STARS.,2,0,583
A1CSP8EXLD27YA,49,I sure wish I had. Ive owned the nook for about 48 hours. I went into the purchase knowing rewiews stated there was latency and the battery life wasnt what was advertised. Barnes and Noble said it would give you 10 days mine doesnt want to get to 100% and from the 90% I could get it to only has 2 days. The reviews did not state that the nook freezes to the point where you have to remove the back and battery and turn it back on. Did I mention the battery is held in with a tiny crew hope you carry a small screwdriver with you. So tomorrow it is going back to Barnes and Noble and I will be getting a Kindle 2. I hope it works better.,2,0,637
A1CU2YXKQHA6XC,0,I gave this to my daughter as a birthday gift...she plays the violin and loves computers so I thought it was perfect. Its beautiful and the small tag was perfect for a small engraving.The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was that I found the small flash drive hard to pull from the slot. Its a struggle to get it to come out each time. Im not sure if this is the same with all of them or just this particular one I ordered.Overall it was a great buy and I was happy with it,4,1,476

A1CUCF36AV4W9L,55,I got my Nook last Sunday. and so far I love it. Before I bought it. I searched the internet for a while and I came to the a conclusion that Nook was the best for me. The touch screen is not as fast as an Iphone  but it is pretty good. Another thing that I like from the nook is that I can download free  ebooks from many sites and even the local library because it supports several formats like PDF.ePub. it is no like others ereaders that do not support epub so cant lent or get free books from library or websites.,5,1,517

A1D01ZPFHKJZTG,22,I purchased this for a three day 4x4 drive on the Kokopelli Trail in UT. I used a Bandi mount and a 4 Firestik antenna with it and picked up a cheap SWR meter here on Amazon. With the antenna tuned in I was able to transmit and receive over several miles in the desert. In the mountainous areas the range diminishes as you lose clear line of site but we still had no problems communicating with everyone in our group of 12 vehicles which were at times quite spread out. I ran the antenna cable into my center console along with an extra 12v power plug and I really like that I can quickly disconnect the unit and lock it away in the glove box when it is not in use.I liked this unit so much in fact that I purchased another one for my father. We used it on a 4wheeling trip. me with an external antenna and him with the battery pack and mobile antenna that comes with the unit. The range on this setup is quite limited. Maybe 100 meters when the radio is inside the vehicle. For a group of two vehicles it was adequate and we were able to talk all day without issue. For a larger group an external antenna is really a must. If you are using the radio outside of the vehicle the range is pretty decent. I have used these two radios on a dirtbiking trip and achieved over a mile of range with the radios in their handheld setups.FYI  I recently switched to a 2 Firestik from the 4 so I could park in my garage without removing the antenna and the range is still more than adequate for my needs and I notice no difference in clarity.,5,1,1530

A1D2RF3X0L3PUV,33,It didnt work for me at all.  Everytime I tried to read a diskette with information that Id copied from another computer. it wanted to reformat.  When I tried to read a diskette that had come preformatted. it didnt even recognize there was a diskette inserted.  Useless all around. so I had to return it.,1,0,304
A1D3MYYUV2U9NS,2830,I bought these with some trepidation due to the wide variation in ratings found here. They worked great in my house.  The tuner is in my basement and now I can listen to music in my living room which is one floor up and about 2530 diagonal feet from the tuner.  I tried them in my back porch which is  another 20 feet away and they worked fine there too. Tuning for me took  less than 3 minutes.  The only negative is I had to use my headphone jack  which worked out fine but when using this jack you have to carefully turn  the tuners volume dial until the wireless transmitters light starts  blinking intermittently .for best signal to speakers..  On my tuner the  dial works best a fairly low volume on the tuner volume knob so if I want  to keep the main wired speakers on it has to stay at that volume. You CAN  turn the wirelesss volume up as loud as you want.,4,1,866
A1D4X814JSEUXC,11,The only reason I am not giving this cable 1 star. is because it did work well to charge my phone. but for the nexus tablet it is garbage.

Seriously. save your money. folks.,2,0,344

A1D71CIRJ1M79I,11,The design is flawed. It the head of the adapter is really flimsy. It doesnt take very much for the plastic that covers the adapter to break and fall off.

A1D71EEMRU7GMD,55,These speakers are very nice.but dont get me wrong. they dont have the power of Yamaha Power Cubes.  For the average user. they will work great and you will have no complaints.  But for the 1 in every 100 they will not have the power and the hissing noise when the volume is cranked will deter them from telling their friends about their new speakers.  So if you are an average user that would like a mighty fine peice of equiptment. then these are they way to go but if you are the super music fan then look elsewhere.,4,1,519
A1D7OMC92BQOQ0,3,I bought mine in Nov 2012 and it lasted until Mar 2014. I called BN to see what they could do for me. they offered a replacement exchange since it was out of warranty for USD55. Pretty horrible deal.That said. the display is nice and easy on the eyes. which is why I gave it 3 stars.Seems like Amazon has more books and with my prime subscription. it only makes sense to go with a kindle now. Farewell BN. Hello Amazon!,3,0,419
A1D7WKS43Y6AVY,11,I bought a new pair of Motorola Talkabout FV300 radios and it simply does not work with them.  When I plug it in. turn it on and press the PTT button. the radio starts transmitting and doesnt stop until I shut the radio off.  I knew the VOX feature wouldnt work. but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the PTT button.  It does not.  However. it does work with my older Talkabout which is a T5000. but not with VOX.  Im giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which dont.,2,0,568

A1DB9VACW58HQQ,55,I did a lot research about different ereaders before purchasing the Nook.  It had really came down to these main criterion for my purchase.1. Is it simple and easy to get books online. does it use a book buying web format I am accustomed to?2. Will I make back some of my investment on the device by deals on ebooks?3. Is it simple and fun to use. comfortable to hold. and do I look cool using it?4. Can I test drive before I buy?Some of the things I was not concerned with were.1. Listening to music. audio books and being read to.2. Name brand of device.The Nook won out for several reasons.  First. at the time I was buying it .February 2010. Barnes and Noble ebooks were actually the same price or slightly cheaper then Amazons.  This was the case for many of the books I was most interested in reading .leisure reading..  I also was already familiar with Barnes and Nobles websites format and functionality .the way the colored touch screen interfaced with their website was really visually pleasing..  I also like to mull around in Barnes and Noble stores. and liked the feature that you can read books for free .for an hour. while in a store.  I also like that you can lend books to other Nook owners.  Second. I have already recooped the cost of my Nook in what I have saved on books.  I like to read classics. and now I can read them for free on my Nook.  Downloading them is very easy.  I also have found websites online for discounted books. some that are mainstream authors. some are not. but all are amusing to read.  The EPub format that the Nook uses is pretty common and it is easy to convert pdfs and other ebook types to EPUB using free programs like Calibre. Third. I liked the software that the Nook uses in comparison to the Kindle.  Although I have not done this myself. apparently you can illegally hack your Nook and get a chat program to work. or a facebook thing etc.  Again. I have not done it .and NO ONE should ever do that because it voids your warrenty and can destroy your device.. but I like the idea that you can do more things with their OS.  To me it means that one day Barnes and Noble may make the device legally capable of doing more then just readingdownloading books. and I think that is great!  Finally. the selling point for me was going to a Barnes and Noble store and being able to hold a Nook and read a few pages and test it out.  It felt so good in my hands. and had a nice weight to it. with sharp text and a smooth modern case.Of course there are some strange things about the Nook. i.e. sometimes a book takes a little long to load etc.  However. the majority of your time is spent reading and turning pages. and I have had hardly any issues with that.  Battery life is all it needs to be. it lasts long enough that charging it is not a hassle.  I have not tried any audio books or music on it.  I have an Ipod for things like that. and honeslty do not understand how someone could read and listen to music at the same time.  Even after all these months. I have not once wanted my Nook to play music or read me a book. reading by itself has just been so great.  Since getting the Nook. I have somehow managed to read much more then I ever have before. Probably that is due to having a library at my fingertips. so I can read whatever I am in the mood for. it is easy to take everywhere. and it is quick to get a book.  As far as quality of a device goes. my friends with other ereaders of a lesser quality say that the Nook has very sharp and dark text in comparison to what they have .older ereaders or cheaper devices..  However. that is because of the quality of the device. not brand name.Update 1182010 I have had my Nook for several months now. and I am still in love with it.  I have about 200 books on it. most of them free from google or other websites.  I am reading more than I have ever read before in my life. and without leaving the trail of hundreds discarded paperbacks in my wake.  The Nook recently did a massive update and now it has games and can surf the internet.  I have not had any hardware issues with it. even loading tons of documents onto it all at once caused no freezing.  The battery life still lasts for several days .with wireless off..  I have no buyers remorse. even after the price dropped and even after they came out with the Nook color. I still feel like my purchase was worth every penny because I got to enjoy it for months before the price went down. and it is still a high quality item.  I highly recommend if you are deciding between the Nook and another device to try it before you buy it.  Go to a Barnes and Noble and try a Nook. AND go to a Target or a Best Buy .they have Kindles... but from what I have seen they are not powered on and usually are beat up. and try holding a Kindle.  Borrow one from a friend for a few hours and make sure the device fits you and what you need it for!,5,1,4885

A1DEXM92ZX18X1,11,Well. this cable is exactly what the description says it is...50 feet of RJ45 cat 5e cable. Item arrived very quickly and well packaged. I do recommend that if you live somewhere cold that you let the cable warm up before attempting to unravel it. but thats just common sense.This cable is a great. inexpensive solution for getting your device connected. The computer we needed this cable for is just as fast as the other one thats directly connected to the internet. No loss of speed that I can tell.Seriously. if you need a cable like this. DO NOT HESITATE!!! The price blows anything youll pay at a regular store right out of the water.Excellent product and does exactly what its supposed to do.,5,1,698

A1DJ5OM2WAWLQG,2,The cable works. I ordered the yellow one. cause yellow is my favorite color and I like everything to be yellow.  The cord came and was actually mustard. not yellow.  Kind of dissapointing.  If I knew it wasnt really yellow. I would have just gotten a grey one.,3,0,261
A1DJUF6CE8TQOW,2122,The Motorola Talkabout 280 2way radio is the nearperfect tool for outdoor enthusiasts with a need to communicate with one another.  Its compact design means it fits well in a pocket. a backpack or clipped onto a  belt.  The controls are easy to use and the darn thing is loud enough to be  heard through 3layers bombing down Mt. Baker on a snowboard.  The  rechargeable battery is a huge feature.  I cant imagine using it with AAs.  It easily lasts all day on the slopes trails and even during an ascent on  the Grand Teton.  Charge time is minimal. but I would recommend charging it  over night before you take off on your destination.A couple of minor  nitpicks now.  The talk button is directly in front of the mouthpiece.  Its not a huge deal. but sometimes you miss the first word of what people  are saying.  Its plastic construction is durable. but dropping it or  falling on it could prove fatal.  Its not really weatherproof either.  A  friend of mine got some mud and rain on his and had to take it apart to let  it dry. but heck it still works great so no big complaint there.If  you participate in any type of outdoor activity with family and friends I  highly recommend you pick up a set of these radios.,4,1,1217
A1DJZKINYPSVAO,6970,I love the great design of Palm V. this is my first palm and now I use it all the time to organize my schedule.MEMORY . Palm V provides only 2 MB of memory. which is one of the major drawbacks.  Installing all the  softwares that I needed took about 1.2MB. left me about 0.8MB for data and  stuffs. .btw there are lots of great freeware available which most I found  are better than the correspondence shareware.BATTERY PROBLEM . 3COM  advertised that one charge will last about 1 months. only true if you dont  use it regularly or  you use your cradle everyday to charge it. .it also  takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour to charge in cradle daily. One charge last  less than 2 or 3 days for me. well I almost use it most the time. organize  my schedule. expense. and playing games while waiting for my  appointment.PC ORIENTED . Palm products are also PC oriented. I use unix  systems most the time. and use my PC just to charge or synchonize with the  palm.  .it will be nice if they can provide a unix compatible cradle.  Anyway inspite of all the drawbacks. I love the Palm V. go get your own and  you will feel becoming a different person.SEVERAL ADVICES. 1. check for  available freeware b4 you buy the shareware version. 2. You will need at  least a slim leather case. .the one coming with Palm V. cause more problems  than the benefits like the never off beeping. 3. Buy Palm Vx if you have  more money. 4. If you decide to buy a Palm or its accesories. always search  the net first. dont buy at the first place you found it.  You might end up  paying 20%50% off in other place.,4,1,1583
A1DJZPJVXAQG09,33,I got the bag a month ago. Its a great looking bag and sturdy.

A1DLUOL9P1VF4A,0,Yep. It gets the job done. Havent had any trouble so far as loading programs and syncing accounts. The interface was surprisingly easy to get used to. I thought I would have a bit of trouble but I would say this is a good tablet to jump in and get using. The only thing I think is weak about this tablet is its struggling to stay connected to wifi. It has to be really close to the router in order to not be booted off...I am pretty sure based on some room testing around mine and another friends house. In the same room as the router was fine. but in the next room over it starts losing connectivity.,4,1,601
A1DLW0ERPD8CU,13,i bought mine one month ago and i love it!...my dreams have been answered and i just cant say enough about this player.  Just the fact that i can watch movies anywhere i go is the biggest plus.  if you are looking for  portability this is it....,5,1,245
A1DMP8WDIN9DF,2829,I searched for this unit on Amazon to see what other owners had to say about it.  I was shocked to see the same exact problems.I too had major  clicking noises .that can only be explained by hearing. and locking up.  etc.  I luckily was within the year warranty .by a week!. and had it fixed.  But certainly. this unit is something to pass on.I wanted a larger  variety in random play other than 5. but not as obnoxious as 100+. So I  felt 25 was just right.  But the annoyance of waiting for it to process  its thoughts and getting to the next cd.. or just plain stopping to change  one cd is unacceptable. With so many of the same problems. these units  should be replaced.Attention Pioneer Company. Feel free to contact me to  offer me a newer improved model.  Otherwise. I am off to any other brand  but Pioneer for any product.,1,0,832
A1DN2H0QBLJ49W,0,I like that I can get colors so I know whos plug is whose. works as it should and looks good,4,0,92
A1DNB9U9ZFOK0M,2020,Ive had this player for close to a year now. and its an absolutly amazing piece of equipment.  Im very picky with things like this. and this was my third DVD player.  Id previously returned an RCA player. and a  Hitachi player before settling on this one.  No disapointment whatsoever.  Great for those of us with a 6ch input receiver. but no built in decoder  in the amp.  It gives you the ability to adjust almost every different  aspect of the picture right on the player.  You can adjust the volume and  delay on every individual speaker. as well as tell it what size your  speakers are.  If you like lots of surround sound effect. just hook up some  decent speakers. and tell the player to crank up the surround sound volume.  Likewise for the subwoffer setting.  The remote is GREAT and gives very  easy to use features.  While Im completly satified with this player.  heres my complaints with it...1. its only a 2x player. so when you  fast forward in double speed. you can see every frame being played. but  beyond that. it must skip frames to advance rapidly.  Computer DVDROMs  come at 12x already. so I think they could have made it faster.  As it is.  the player will advance anywhere from 2x to 100x in fast forward mode  depending on your prefrence.2. The dual layer DVDs give a VERY BRIEF  pause while switching layers.  Almost all players do this. but itd be nice  it the manufacturers would use a buffer to avoid the pause completely.3.  The u0026quotilluminated remoteu0026quot is glow in the dark buttons that you  cant see after the lights been off for more then 3 or 4 mintes.  Itd  have been nice if the remote was backlit with an actual light inside.4.  The 1999 Hitachi and most 1998 Sony DVD players had dual laser pickups.  The picture was read with one laser. and the audio with the other.  This  makes no noticable difference in the quality of viewing movies. but only  players with the dual laser pickup will play CDR discs like the ones you  make in your computers CD writer.  Hitachi. since dropper the dual laser  from its player. and Sony now only has it on their topoftheline  model.5. If you stop the movie and do a picture or audio adjustment in  the configuration menu. you have to manually refind the spot you were at  in the movie.  If you just hit stop and play the player automatically  goes back to where you were when you hit stop.These are just small  complaints. and for what its worth. this is an awesome player.,5,1,2458
A1DNB9U9ZFOK0M,1516,Ok. lets be serious here.  Any player you buy is going to havean amazing picture.  Likewise. the sound on any machine will make VHSseem pathetic.  So what you want is ease of control. and reliablity. This is an OK machine. but after trying both. I settled on the Panasonic DVDA320 over this on for a few reasons.  First. the 6 channel discrete output for Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS that you cant get on this model.  Unless your tuner has a decoder. this feature is worth the extra coin.  On the 320. you can adjust the dB level of every individual speaker output.  u0026ltNICEu0026gt The remote is very intuitive making control an breeze compared to the confusing Hitachi and RCA button butchers.  Ive experienced absolutly no pixilation or skipping as others have on this model.  My only complaint is that they couldnt be bothered to throw in a lousy svideo cable with the package like they used to.  A small loss on a great machine.  Pay the extra and buy the A320 model.,2,0,972
A1DOBFHF7XTYMA,22,This produt is junk. That is why I returned it.WHY HAVNT I RECEIVED THE REFUND?,1,0,79
A1DOFBSJT3SSKZ,44,Its a wall wart.  Its black.  It works.  It looks just like the ones for my pocket camera. iPod amp. cell phone... Im going to have to start labeling these things.,5,0,163
A1DPLVM1XJEYLK,1214,I ordered this card to use as a secondary video card under win 98.  Apparantly even though Microsoft suggests ATI cards for use in dual monitor  configurations. i failed to get this card to work consistantly as a  secondary card.  I did have it working for about a week. after messing with  it for 2 hours trying assorted configurations.  Then when i rebooted today.  it quit again. and locks the machine at boot.  I hear that this card will  work in a secondary configuration under Win 2000 without any problems. and  it did work nicely when i set it up as a primary card to run tests to make  sure it wasnt a defective card.As for my background. Ive been  assembling systems since 286s. and im 1 year from completing a bachelors  degree in computer engineering from The University of Michigan.  Im also  HP Service Authorized for Kayak. Vectra. and Brio PCs. and i repair PCs  for the university.,3,0,898
A1DPTFY0G6P7SY,1,Did not include the arms shown. therefore when i went to use the only mounting option i had. it covered over the plug socket. so i had to rig it up on the top holess and use some 90 degree picture frame angle brackets to make it work,2,0,233
A1DPXT0KOT1UDE,0,I bought this for use with a Motorola Talkabout that I use while airsofting. Its great that I can use it with one hand and that it clips to the front of my vest. My only gripe is that I wish the cord was about three inches longer. as its a bit of a stretch from the walkie on my backpack over my shoulder to the front of my vest. However. Im 64 . so I shouldve expected this a little bit. Nevertheless. a dependable accessory and very much worth the money.,4,1,456
A1DQHGD3T6UO3O,1415,The sound quality is below par. NO base and there is a constant hissing sound. When the volume is increased the sound gets very distorted. The advantage is that it is very easy to set up any where to about 150 away without runnig wires. Good additonal set of speakers to setup in different locations outsideindoor in a small area for parties but not a good set of speakers to listen too as your main speakers.,3,0,409
A1DRHD8HTCRS8,0,gave as gift they state it works well,4,0,37
A1DRS5KUJHMKJG,0,The Brother Black on Clear tape came exactly as described on the web site.  Installed and ready for labeling again.,4,1,115
A1DS0IESVWVVPF,79,This is a good enough VCR. which I bought to replace a Sony in the same price range. The machine just arrived and Im both happy and disappointed. Happy because the machine was a breeze to set up. works fine. and is  blessedly silent in operation. On the other hand. recording quality is not  very good and the construction is cheesy. There is no counter on the unit  itself. which is an annoyance .especially since you cant hear the unit  playing. rewinding. anything.. Im happy enough to keep it and it plays  prerecorded tapes beautifully... but I liked my Sony better.,2,0,571
A1DS0IESVWVVPF,79,I have one of these that has died... I would consider replacing it with another. but Im a bit gunshy. The machine has great features and excellent performance. But mine broke down several times before its untimely death.  And the picture quality on recording was slightly mediocre. The machine DID  stand up to a LOT of use .we recorded endless hours of soaps and Babylon  5.. The onscreen menus were not as good as the could have been. but worked  reliably. But here I am getting another machine... and Im not sold on the  picture quality of this unit. ..sigh.. Its probably perfect for most  people. If you rent a movie or two a week. this is the unit for you.,3,0,662
A1DT42LYGIBI1M,3236,These little radios work GREAT!  Ive used them A lot and theyve worked better than I expected.  The 14 channels are perfect for most users.  If  ones being used up. theres always at least one free.  The range is pretty  good too.  I had one in a school bus talking to my friend. and I was in a  15 passenger van.  We were able to talk clearly for nearly one mile. and  about 14 of a mile later we started to break up.  Not too bad on Los  Angeles freeways if you ask me.,5,1,470
A1DT8GLQLHJ3EW,0,The car charger adapter worked fine and I was able to charge my camera using that method.  However. the AC adapter failed to charge.  I contacted the company and they sent me another AC charger with no success.  Ive tried contacting them again and relayed the details of what is going on and so far they have not provided a resolution.  I would not suggest purchasing this product for the Kodak M340 camera.  Not sure if it would work with any others.,1,0,451
A1DTMC1668FIDQ,11,My husband bought two of these for myself and my daughter for Christmas. Mine wouldnt stay on unless it was plugged in and now it wont even turn on at all. My daughters worked for a day then it also randomly shut off and wont turn back on regardless of whether its plugged in or not. These are being returned and we will never buy another nook tablet.,1,0,351
A1DTW1YNPS5RUV,22,I got this stereo for free after it was given to me. For over 8 years. it sat in a basement. unused and unloved. When I finally cracked the box open. I set it upeasily. It was awesome! Great sound quality. although without HarmanKardon speakers. it doesnt perform as well. Can handle many additions such as CD players. iPods. cassette decks. and more. I use it on a daily basis just about every day. It was made in 1998. and it still is one of the best receivers out there. The power transformer only buzzes when it is hooked up to an extension cord. or non 120V outlet. It may be old. but it still is one of my favorite possessions. If you are looking for a good receiver with a lot of life left. this one is a better option. as opposed to a minisystem. or third party company.,5,1,778
A1DTXZBDSPGM3E,56,No peripheral or software should ever take more than 15 minutes to install and make work. If it does it is an u0026quotantiproductivityu0026quot tool.  Life is too short to waste hours overcoming the deficiencies of poor design and confused ?  market claims.  Example. setup instructions direct user to  power up. put in a CD. and connect the cable.  Well. it came with an  u0026quotinstallation floppyu0026quot that only contained uninstall overlays.  There was no CD!  VEry bad sign.  I tried everyting.  Could not even do  basic trouble shooting because too many possible variables.  Question is. how does one print with a PC that only has USB ports?,1,0,653
A1DV3TKP3YXO7O,22,I have always been a fairly skeptical critic of ereaders.  When I first heard of the Kindle. I thought the idea was pretty absurd. to need an electronic device that mimics something as universally understood as a book.  However. as I grew older and grew more cynical that I will probably never get my 10+ books Ive lent out over the years back. the idea of an ereader started to sound more desirable.  Enter the Nook.Ive read a lot of bad press on this little guy.  Most of the bad press seemed to stem from consumer reviews. which I honestly take to heart moreso than professional critics.  Here is a list of things Ive noticed people dont seem entirely too fond of regarding the Nook. and my experience with these negative aspects. Battery Life.  Although shorter than some ereaders .but not at ALL as short as the Nook color or any tablets you may purchasealready have. I havent yet felt constricted or nervous that my battery will deplete midway through a book.  I would think that considering the era were in of constantly recharging our phones .I have to recharge my Droid Incredible nearly every 8 hours after moderate usage. we would be a little more forgiving if the Nook only lasts a mere week.  I dont mind recharging it oncetwice a week while I sleep... I dont think anyone should to be honest. but thats just me. LCD touch screen. This is one of those gripes I find somewhat warranted.  This is definitely the reason for the shorter battery life .set it to sleep after 10 or 30 seconds. and brightness to about 15%. but my biggest gripe is that it can be unresponsive at times.  I never once. however. found the navigation to be clunky or as unresponsive as some people claim... but I think these gripes found in earlier reviews has been remedied through a major update to the Nook firmware.  Yay!  I found the navigation to be highly intuitive and the built in dictionary highly helpful.I love this thing.  I love being able to read Barnes u0026 Noble classics for free. checking ebooks out from the library. and the prospect of sharing books with others who own a Nook.  This is an excellent piece of technology. and for the price its going for right now... a HUGE steal.  Get one if youre on the fence. you wont regret it.,5,1,2238
A1DV9C6WOFEFNL,22,Im an Englishsecondlanguage instructor. and one of my students bought a reading pen so she could efficiently get word definitions and pronunications.The pen works fine. but in learning to use it. rely on your own experimenting more than by reading the owners manual. One trick I accidentally figured out .that is not described in the manual. gets the pen to read an entire sentence without the need for your prompts between each word. Heres how to do it. 1. have the pen read the sentence from right to left. 2. press ESC. 3. press left arrow key.Its a fun product. and seems to work reliably so far.,4,1,600
A1DVTOSTJ1ZYK7,23,A word of caution. make sure you download the windows 2000patch ...Installing the drivers from the HP CD will cause W2K not to loadagain... .blue stop screen. not even letting to load in safe mode...Thankfully Windows 2000 selfrepairs. as soon as you put in the W2K install CD.,4,1,277
A1DW139TWXVQ9Q,17,This cable truly is professional grade and far exceeds the cheap  HP TouchPad cable.If you are having problems charging your TouchPad get one of these cables and throw the HP cable away. The HP cables dont hold up.,5,1,214
A1DX2AV6K881ZD,2339,I bought HPs 8GB tape drive about 20 months ago.  At the time it shipped with only a Windows 95 version of the backup program. When the Windows 98 version became available 3 months later. I was informed that it would cost  another USD35 to get a u0026quotnewu0026quot version of the software.  The title  for this review says it all.,1,0,333
A1DXJ5M84IOCFV,3737,Ive owned this camera for some time. and I couldnt put it down when I first got my battery charged!The Mavica series is a blessing.  The FD73 is. I recommend. to be used for general purpose shooting.  The absence of a manual focus and poor quality photographs under lowlighting conditions forces me to rate this with only 4 stars instead of 5.  Photos appear too grainy under lowlight.The 10x zoom is great.  The included NPF330 rechargable Lithium battery is a godsend. giving you up to 3 hours of continual use.  Good idea would be to purchase an additional NPF550 which lasts much longer.  I always keep one in use. and the other on charge.  The batteries will last around two years before they need to be replaced.  These batteries can be used with many other Sony digital cameras and camcorders.My biggest gripe with the FD73 is its resolution. JPEGs are only 640x480 in size.  The compression is soso.  However. the picture effects .sepia. Bu0026ampW. solarize. negative. are pretty nifty. although I only used the Bu0026ampW myself.  Similar effects can be achieved using any good graphics program.  The LCD can be very difficult to view while outside under sunny conditions.  Another gripe is the whitebalance. you cant control it.  Taking pictures of family against open scenery is difficult. making photographs appear to be backlit.The controls were easy to manipulate. and the floppy disc can hold anywhere from 1 .if using Bitmap mode. to 20 pictures .depending on image..  Of course. you can fit more images on a disc using Bu0026ampW mode if you prefer to take black and white photographs.I eventually upgraded to the FD91. which isnt available on Amazon.com anymore.  As for the FD73. if youre into quality. go for a better model.,4,1,1745
A1DZ40L4KOXBT7,35,This thing is pretty good for its price. and thats good for me because I dont want to pay USD... for a walkman. It worked until I dropped it the third time on the pavemant. and the radio worked for sometime there after. Im going to buy another one beacuse its .... ..,4,1,267
A1DZC9HFGWFYAM,0,I bought one of these a number of years ago.  The frequency drift and tuning backlash made the receiver almost useless on the shortwave bands .my primary interest.  The sound on AM and FM was good but you can spend a whole lot less and get the same performance.  Wouldnt recommend to anyone. unless youre just looking for an interesting bobble to put on a shelf somewhere.,2,0,372

A1E10GAJBMYVVL,3339,What a joy to use!  It took some time in front of the computer setting up some macros. but how much easier can it get!  I now have ONE button that not only turns on all of my components. but sets all the AV switches  correctly!  I have another button .one button!. that resets all the AV  gear so that I can watch my DVD Movie. Another single button to change  everything again to watch a VCR movie....get the picture?  AND..another  button for when my wife or friends press a wrong button or buttons that  mess everything up..u0026quothoney. why is there picture and no sound..u0026quot  or u0026quothoney. why is there sound and no picture..u0026quot.  I used to have  to buzz through a menu to figure out what whas changed.  Now I have a  button that I labled Fix TV and it does!  No matter what the problem  was!  I have also set up screens to do EVERY function of the 10 remotes  that I use.  It has yet to miss my expectations.  My hat is off to HK and  Microsoft.,5,1,970
A1E12DQULC2GZF,0,This is probably a fine product. but I didnt know anything about them and found that I needed the base unit in order to use this remote.  I couldnt wait another week or more. so I returned the product and purchased another brand locally. This RCA product was outdated so I couldnt find a matching base...thats the reason for purchasing another brand.,2,0,350
A1E29CA4LMODME,33,From a person who earns his living with a mouse.  I work with CADCAM software daily.  In the old days a mouse might last 6 months  this one lasted over three years.  My boss bought a TrackMan Marble one day and soon we all had them due to the comfort. No hand cramping!  In CAD you constantly use your mouse pointer and this was the best of the best.  Too bad they discontinued it.  The replacement design was not made for the pro  its simply a consumer mouse.  Once a person becomes used to this mouse. he or she wants no other.  If you considering this mouse for a try I say buy it!,5,1,584
A1E3L17KTUHUTS,0,These would work great if the battery lasted long and the videos lasted longer than a couple seconds to 15 minutes... The night vision is great. the video is great. the sound is great. its very discrete .I tried using it as a nanny cam... fail.. This would be a win if it lasted a while. or maybe if there was some time of external cord that kept it on at least...,2,0,364
A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ,66,If all you want is a tablet for reading Bu0026N books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game. this is for you.  Otherwise. pass.This is listed as an Android tablet but its not.  Its Android on the surface but it cant access Google Play and instead uses the Bu0026N app store.  This means paying for apps that are free elsewhere.Also. my unit takes an incredibly slow 2 minutes to boot. drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer.Wonder where the camera is?  Its at the factory  there isnt one.  Forget Skype or face to face video chatting.Spend your USD200 on a real tablet.By the way. not a slap at Amazon. just the tablet itself.,1,0,720
A1E4NJ338NJY33,45,I have been having my PALM II for more or less 1 year and am very happy with it.  The handling of directions. appointments. alarms. todos. cocktails. even TVshows is excellent.The memory capacity is something limiting when you begin to use 3rdapps .Irda Remote Control emulation. DocuemntsToGo.etc..  The backlight is very shining. and its consumption of batteries .alkalines. is fair .1 pair every month..I bought this one from a friend that boght it from another friend. im the 3d owner. but even so. keeps totally useful. no scratchs and goodlooking.Its some heavy and big .its not a ZIRE!. but for the beginner that wants to wipe out all the papers and the phone book. its perfect!A point important to consider is the size of the screen. in my opnion. is a bit greater than the rest. so the fonts appear more clear and you read them easier.And finally. the price. Its an old model .its a Classic!. therefore if you can get one of this. just do it!. its very cheap for their services.Come to the Palm world = .,4,1,1013
A1E596DNI14490,2,When I first go the Nook Color for my birthday I was super excited but as time went on I started having problems with it. The touch screen is not so great.it has slowworking internet and last and certainly least it has a horrible tendency to crash.,3,0,248
A1E683MBPCZKL,35,I just got my EigerMan for christmas adn i got it up and running in less than 10 minutes. this was as easy as 123 to set up. I definitely reccomend this to anyone with a computer and an I.Q. higher than a Cabbage.,5,1,213
A1E7KC8UU80ZNF,1717,There are many. many different items I need to configure or load software into doing the job I do....a lot of it via a serial cable to a dock or console port.But not all null modem cables are created equal I found out the hard way a long time ago.Most newer items are fine with a simple 3wire cable that crosses over only pins 23 .xmtrcv. and passes ground.But many things require a full 5wire that passes through the other signals as well....a 3wire fails in these scenarios.This cable here is a full 5wire...with both 25 and 9 pin connectors on EACH side.I also attached 9 and 25 Belkin MaleMale Gender changers....so this cable literally connects to everything and gets my job done without lugging around a bunch of different cables.If you are an unlucky tech like me who has to interface with items the old fashioned serial way on a regular basis....this cable will find a permanent home in your already full laptop case!,5,1,925
A1E84D5349WMDR,0,It works about one quarter of the time.  I have to keep reinstalling the driver and I have not gotten through a complete task without having to unplug the drive and start over.  I have not been able to find a resolution.  Luckily. Ill be through transferring the files soon and I can throw this drive away.,2,0,306
A1E8PWW106DRBE,77,I am not going to repeat all previous reviewers on excellency of AM and FM receiving.  Its all true.  But quality of product is just horrible.  Look. I formerly lived in Ukraine and Soviet Union and to tell you the truth I havent seen such horrible finish and quality in Soviet portable radios.  Quality or a lack of it is just appalling.  The tuning knob will fell off very soon.  Theres no soft material under battery doorso battery rattle .I put some paper inside it cured rattle..  I understand this product made in China. but look you can buy Sony. Grundig. or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in China. as a matter of fact. almost everything nowdays made in China.  Its not a question whether or not something made in China its a matter how good it made there.  This radio is obviously was made in garage in China.  Just tell me why. but why theres no light on tuning scale. how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb.  GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all.  I wouldnt ever buy this product for looks.  It looks awful. but reception on AM is excellent. yes it is.,4,1,1127
A1E9FFQJ8K2FTK,0,This is a good price and its exactly what you would expect. I dont have any complaints about this product.,4,1,106

A1EA08F54PPH4O,11,I have tried several waterproof radios and these Sonys are the only ones that work well. If the volume went a little louder I would have given it 5 stars.,4,1,154
A1EA2THI0H554T,4147,Bought it thru a store in Tyson Corner. Northern VA.  Tried to have repaired. mfg will not support. must return thru retailer.  Its been gone over 30 days. Pd USD250 for it u0026amp Sony version looks easier to use u0026amp  is less USD.  Do not recommend.,1,0,256
A1EAN2SFKYBJ05,0,A simple little product that is a great help in keeping control cords used on a video jib. I like having them in various colors so as to be able to keep track better of several different cords. These are well made.,5,1,214
A1EBC6RP8ZCJ4F,13,... The RIO 500 performs flawlessly. in every aspect.  Itssoftware is great. and the size and sound quality are superb also.  Toanyone contemplating waiting for the new players. I wouldnt recommend it.  They will be just like MiniDisc players... a big joke.  Thank You.,5,1,269
A1EC0TL90E6D9M,58,I have had my MD player for close to a year now and I use it daily and very extrenuously.  Three screws fell out .nothing big though..  After about eight months it starts acting up and doesnt read any disc you put in  it .even new ones..  It frequenly skips. even when sitting untouched on my  desk.  But the sound quality is excellent. especially when I record  digitally live at some concerts.  It just brings a tear to my eye when  listeing to the live recordings. up until the unit skips. and then doesnt  find itself on the disk and turns itself off.  And after all of this use  the unit has become so messed  up that it wont even record.  I took it  in a total of three times where I was lucky enough to have purchased an  extended warranty on it.  And after all three weeks that I waited  MiniDiscless. I found out that three times cannot fix the unit and I get  store credi for a new one.  So I suggest if  you need an MD player  that can take abuse. buy something else.  The 702 cant handle everyday  abuse.,2,0,1016
A1ECI8HL2C790A,1616,I have had nothing but problems with this camera.  The manual focus doesnt add focus to anything. and it is difficult to get the light exactly right for the camera to work well.  The program even caused my computer to  crash due to major incompatibility problems.  Xirlink Tech Support was of  no help whatsoever  they dont even answer their phone .you have to call  long distance and leave a message..,1,0,402
A1ED3KGIW0O7XN,47,the product is good. but if it was smaller and lighter. i would have gone for it.,4,0,81
A1EFQVCRZX5QSU,0,I bought four of these with the idea that if one had problems. Id be able to troubleshoot a little better.  Well. one of the three hasnt even been used.  Of the other three. only one hasnt had an issue.  The other two have had skipping problems on CDs.  With one. I was able to clean the laser .something Ive never had to do on any other CD player Ive owned. and it began working properly.  The other one didnt respond to that.  It simply skips over CDs like it doesnt see them.Ive noticed other RCA models similar to this have been ripped for their CD players.  I also wonder if some of the people posting positive reviews had problems later.  I think Ill head to another brand next time.,2,0,689

A1EG006YRUNWL1,0,A simple cable like this Belkin will run you about USD37 or usually more at computer stores.  Its crazy.  They tried to sell me one. and you do need one to connect with your computer. but you dont need to pay this outrageous amount.  I guess thats where their profit comes in.  This cable is perfect. even with shipping much much cheaper!,5,1,338
A1EGTFAFQ855WA,1225,this product is extremely sad when it comes to the quality of the sound.  I think if you are planning on buying a Portable Mp3 player. buy the Rio...it comes in pretty colors too!,1,0,179
A1EH2S92FHWZRP,0,I cant believe this can still be reviewed.  I dont have much to say. but I have a few old contacts still on my ten year old Palm that I still havent transferred over.  I know.  The point is that my Palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly.  I dont think I have even charged it in a few years.  This thing is amazing in its longevity.,4,1,346
A1EH6H3ZNRYMDV,0,This is exactly what I wanted and it functioned as noted in the add. I would recommend this to anyone.,4,1,102
A1EHAC62QOIKS3,0,Does as described. but the cable shield that connects into my phone already broke and I had to tape it back together. Not sure if it was user area. Or the cable itself. Im very careful with my electronics. Needless to say. A working. very cheap alternative to the OEM cables.,3,0,275
A1EHV1ZY1M67SF,0,Good product and fast delivery.  Item was waiting in my mailbox here in Florida when I arrived.  I think the service from United Integral was amazing.,4,1,150

A1EJ49W17BVIXG,33,I purchased the scak27 as a gift for my wife. and from the moment it played our music. we were hooked.  I read the reviews here. and still decided to go for it.  Yes the Cd changer is slow. but worth it for the  quality of sound that the system puts out.  I would buy it again if the  chance arose.  Panasonic is quality.  buy it. try it. youll like it....,4,1,356
A1EJ8ST8K5PQ9L,22,The setup was pretty easy.  I plugged everything in and it worked  or so I thought.  I use this with my Dish Network reveiver.  It shows that the phone line is connected but will not dial out to order payperview.  That dissapoints me a little.  I guess it is possible that it is user error. but I cant find any other instructions on how to corrrect the problem.,3,0,361
A1EJEJQEVL9OGN,0,BOUGHT THE DISK TO CLEAN MY CAR CD PLAYER. WAS ABLE TO INSERT IN. HOWEVER. THE CD PLAYER DIDNT RECOGNIZE THE DISK. AND DIDNT PLAY IT.  IT DID PLAY ON HOME CD. WASTED USD.,2,0,170
A1EJKPTGO474WN,0,THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACT AS ADVERTISED. RECEIVED IN A GOOD TIME PERIOD. INSTALLED AS INSTRUCTED. WORKED JUST FINE. IT DID NEED SOME TRIMING FROM THE BRACKET THAT ATTACHED TO THE TV.

A1EKSHKY9G1K18,4652,I am very happy with my cable lock. Although it does not make your computer equal to Fort Knox. it will at the very least slow a wouldbe theif down. I can hang my 8lb laptop off of it. and bounce it up and down  with the cable. and it holds firm .trial conducted over my bed. a heavily  padded surface.. I like how the cable swivels around the actual lock to  avoid the cable kinking. and becoming cumbersome. I also like the fact that  it is a key operated system. Although combinations are quicker. they can be  hacked in about 5 minutes of trying. and slipping a key in the lock and  giving a quick turn cant be any simpler. Just remember to keep one key in  a safe place. and write the key serial number down somewhere so a  replacement can be found. For the money. I dont think there is a better  security option for notebook computers. unless you spend the USD40 on a  doberman puppy. and train it to attack computer theifs. But that would be  hard. Buy this lock system. and it could save you USD3000.,5,1,1008
A1EKSHKY9G1K18,2020,I bought these radios. because of the first factor I had. They were inexpensive. I wasnt expecting much for the money I invested. but I was most definately surprised at the quality and value I recieved. I took them  to u0026quotA popular resort park in Orlandou0026quot and experienced my first  problem. FRS is a heavily shared frequency. and it was very hard to  communicate with my party. I did have fun talking to other guests. though.  My next trip was to the mountains. Here. they proved invaluable. Noone else  was apparently using FRS in the area when we were there. and it was  excellent for confirming rendezvous times and places. The range is superb.  Somewhat surprising. My voice. and the person I am talking to can easily be  heard sometimes up to a mile away over hill. dale. and wadi. The features  are easy to use. My 5 year old has no problem using it .no. he dosent go  out alone.. The page feature is good to have. as well. The size of the unit  makes it easy to slip into purse or pocket. or attach to a belt with the  clip. It is a breeze to use. and great fun to have. I will never regret  buying mine. and I dont think you will either.,5,1,1159
A1EKXH4JRECI1W,0,Product works as advertised.  No problems with use. would be nice if the the cord was a little bit longer. Limited in where you can plug it in and set it to charge.,4,1,164
A1ELPJWCHN9UT1,67,Go for the Velcro brand self looping ones and LEAVE THESE ALONE.  The Belkin tag even fell off of two of mine.  Moreso. the ties didnt hold very well.  Id never buy these again.,1,0,177
A1EN0HIRFDGC8T,12,New. does the job and arrived on time. Why would you pay two or three times more at an electonics store? Amozon is the place for all your cable needs.,5,0,150
A1ENXTPUEOOC8Q,66,I got this as a birthday present over a year ago and I love it. This minidisc player is such a great benefit that any music lover or electronics enthusiast .sorry for the spelling. should enjoy. With this gadget I was able to record from everything and it saved me a lot of money. I didnt have to buy cds to listen to one song. I would just borrow from friends or family and record the track or  tracks that I liked and return the cd to them. The sound was incredible. I no longer have to worry about not being able to listen to cds because theyre scratched. because when I put it on minidisc. its impossible for the cd inside to  get scratched. Another plus is it does not skip. There are so many positives about the minidisc player that I can go on forever. Its like having a cd burner in your pocket. However despite the positives. it has its downfalls. The buttons are really small and I jammed my skip search button. It cost 50 dollars to get it fixed. I would definately recommend getting a warranty. Also this one eats batterys fast. It takes only 15 hours on 2 batterys. I think  its definately great and I enjoy this player.,4,1,1133
A1EOB9XLQP49P3,23,This was the first piece of equipment I bought when I started building my surround sound home theatre system and I have been very pleased.  I did a significant amount of research and believe this is one of the best DVD  players on the market.  It is definitely a u0026quotMust Haveu0026quot!,5,1,291
A1EP111JFXB6UJ,35,One thing could be improved on. The information on setup and use must have been created in China. I still do not know how to test the alert lights. for statement. watch and Warning. I can.t find any way to do this in the booklet that came with the unit.The Email address does not respond. I still like the purchase and it seems to be a very nice un it.,5,1,352

A1EPF2YAW4NJ12,0,I was shipped the CD240 instead. so we got off on the wrong foot from the start.  Needed to cut out the plastic outer cover to get to the paper instructions inside.  My cdplayer is still having the same issue after trying the cleaner.  Are the 240 u0026 340 the same...not sure...  Hard to give a good rating for the Maxell CD340 when I didnt get a chance to try it.,1,0,366
A1EPVWFTUO0YDU,1414,This product didnt work at all.  After I plugged my garmin into it. at first. I thought it had ruined my Garmin.  My GPS would no longer power on.  When I used my gardmin in the car. it finally worked. I am afraid to try the charger again.,1,0,239
A1EQMTG8TFGUR5,26,Just some clarity  I bought this since it came up with the search for TZ P Touch tape. but it doesnt fit my machine. Now ordering what I really need.,2,0,149
A1EQW1T4UO306F,1517,The camera is up to NIKONs standard of completeness and has more buttons. nobs. and wheels than you can shake a stick at but also is very effective in auto everything mode.  My wife did well in point and shoot with only 15  seconds of training.  I solved the problem that the wide angle zoom  position is not wide enough by buying the wide angle attachment. the  telephoto position is not long enough by buying the teledoubler.  You also  need a 40 mb flash memory card to hold a lot of shots.  An AC adapter with  a long cord for indoor power works well and a rechargeable battery pack for  out door shooting expeditions is manditory.  SanDisk makes a great  flashcard reader so you can import your pictures through the parallel port  at port speed. MSs Photodraw is sufficient for snap shooting processing  and Adobe PhotoShop for heavey duty photo publication. I use an HP 1120C  with HP photo glossy paper for the prints and the results are spectacular.,5,1,957
A1ER23A7CRR5S5,33,Works great.  It is excellent quality.  I use it for my mp3 player in my car. and the sound quality exceeds the ones Ive used in the past.  I had a couple ones from Radio Shack before this one that didnt hold up for very long. and broke after a short while.  The problem area with other one is where the cord connects to the tape and on the other end of the cord where it connects to your audio player.  This Cassette Adapter uses a much more durable cord. which gives it better reliability and sound quality.  I have had no problems whatsoever with this unit and would recommend it to anyone.  I have a discerning ear for sound quality. and this exceeds all other units Ive tried.UPDATE.  I lost my old one when I got a new car. and liked it so much I got another to replace the old one.  I had the old one for 2years without any issues.,5,1,838
A1ES5KIKXELL4M,12,Yes. the Nook Simple Touch is a lovely little ereader  when it works. I bought one last year while living in the US. and soon after the screen startet freezing on a regular basis. requiring a hard reset to start working again. Then after a while the customer service kindly send me a new one. which soon after had the exact same problem  only even worse. Now I am back in Europe and stuck with a useless device. and there seems to be no repair solution! Bu0026N stop sending people defect products. it would save a lot of effort in the first place.,1,0,548
A1ESEP2IGYJDXN,0,I am a gamer. and I dont use headsets. i use headphones. with a seperate mic. I saw someone on headfi.org who bought one of these and used industrial strength velcro to attach one of these to their AD700s. so i decided to try it with my AKGs. It works pretty well. but the mic is real quiet right out of the box. but after turning the volume all the way up and putting the microphone boost up to 10dB. it is super clear and crisp. If you put the mic boost up to 20dB you can hear large amounts of feedback .buzzinghumming noise.. but that it not too big of a problem. because it works fine with a 10dB boost. I would recommend this to any gamer. but if you can spend a little more money. go for the ANT Lion Mod Mic V2.EDIT 10813. I recently replaced the original cable with a cable that connects both the mic and the headphones in one cable. and has a volume control and mute button. and this seemed to reduce the amount of feedback .buzzinghumming noise..,4,1,957
A1ESHV3WO4Z1XY,22,there are a few am channels in town i enjoy listening to. other radios never pulled them in. as soon as i plugged the GE Superadio in. the sound was beautiful. for the price. amazing. Easy to use and pleasant to the eye also.,5,1,225
A1ESJUHJAUCWT1,1316,After taking thousands of pictures with 340R in a long trip. 340R is reliable. But I found some faults.1. only the high resolutions provide good quality  picutures. Low and Medium resolutions pictures look ok on the monitor but not acceptable when print out using a printer2. This camera  has problem with red eyes reduction. Most of the night picutures result  with red eyes.3. taking pictures become so easy that 8 meg or 16 meg  smart card isnt enough for a day long out door.4. using rechargable  battery.,4,1,509

A1EUCKR1IKTNEA,0,I like these Mini Microphones. Plug it in and use with what ever application needed for the microphone on your Ipod.

A1EWK5M6EE1ZYV,1520,I purchased th psion 5 mx in July 2000 and have never wasted USD500 more effectively. I was unable to back it up on my computer and ot broke and lost all of my data. The customer service for Psion was HORRIBLE I was passed on from person to person until I was told that there was no way they could replace my flawed computer. they would only repair it. After 2 weeks. I received my u0026quotrepairedu0026quot computer. only to have it break again 3 weeks later. Once again. Ive lost all my data. Fortunately. I have been able to back it up. Unfortunately. I dont have a psion on which to back it up and nobody at the Psion company has been of any help. I strongly recommend that anybody considering purchasing this product looks closely at other companies such as Palm and Hewlett Packard where the customer service is significantly better. I do not recommend this product to anyone.,1,0,883
A1EWTH5ITFJDA1,12,great.Got it on time and it works very well.I do not regretIt does not even look like a second hand.Looks like brand new,5,0,120
A1EXLXG45YXNR3,315,The battery charge is very short. Customer service is atrocious! I was on hold for 30 minutes and then disconnected. My email was not returned. I had to call a local Bu0026N for help. A 14 day return policy? Most stores give you 30 days or more. This product I believe came to the market too soon. It shouldve been tested more.,1,0,327
A1EXTEQC0ZFMEY,1,I put the tape in and ran it as the directions said but the tape would not elect. I tried dozens of times but it still would not eject. Finally enough came out and I was able to grab it and pull it out. The tape was caught up in the vcr. I would never order this item again. Worthless and could damage your machine.,1,0,315
A1EYBC8UQ71YOW,2731,I was incredibly pleased with my RCA DVD when i bought it at the end of August. The first problem I noticed was while watching u0026quotA Simple Plan.u0026quot The screen flickered during the really white snow scenes. No  problem . . . just the disk I thought. Then after two months of ownership  the DVD decided to eat DVDs rather than play them. The tray would close  and grind and click away until it was good and ready to let go. Needless to  say. I took it back and bought a different brand.,1,0,496
A1EZ64HEC00Z17,3234,I bought the Sharp MDMS722 minidisc recorderplayer the other day.  I must say that I am very satisifed.  I wanted to download MP3 files from the internet. and transfer them to my minidisc.  The cord provided with the minidisc is RCA type. while my computer output jack was 8 mm.  I bought a 8 mm to RCA converter for a couple bucks and it works great.  I can now  transfer files from my computer to the minidisc and vice versa.  Ive  heard others say the sound reproduction is very good. and I agree.It  took me about an hour and a half to learn how to use all the features of  it. The layout of the front of the player is a little busy. and may be  imposing on someone first trying to use it.  But it looks much harder to  use than it actually is.  You use a u0026quotjog dialu0026quot .a ring that  turns. for a couple different functions.  Its a very convenient feature and  makes naming tracks a breeze.  The use of the other buttons came to me  quickly when I used them a time or two.Another nice thing about this  unit is how compact it is.  It fits right in my pocket. so I dont have to  hold it in my hand if I go for a walk.  The headphones provided with the  unit are extremely basic. If youre used to a pair that is more comfortable  or somewhat nicer. youll need to get different headphones.  A rechargable  battery is included with the unit. and can be recharged 300 times.  according to the manual.  You recharge the battery simply by plugging the  player in an electrical outlet.  You can extend the play time by adding a  AAA battery also.  . .I would highly recommend this unit. END,5,1,1599

A1F0J7IHM0KX5G,0,Was sort of perfect for my needs.  Using an obsolete storage system to take obsolete writing files from an older MAC and copy them to an eMAC.  I then had to convert to a current word processing software. OpenSource.Org and then my intent was to plug this Zip Drive into my iMac and copy all those newly translated files to the iMac. But for some reason my iMac couldnt  see  or read the Iomega Zip Drive .it  saw  it at the USB Hub.. So I had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the eMac. Then I was able to copy to the iMac from the flash drive.  .Their Customer Support said the drive had been tested through MAC OS 10.6 and it worked fine .have 10.7.5. Mountain Lion...  In a round about way. the technology served its purpose!  Thank goodness.  .The Seller was quick in responding to my questions.  Good Customer Service..,3,0,837
A1F0RSM4FEAEE,24,Can not agree more with the previous reviwer. My player got malfunction in less than one year. Worse. it swallowed my five CDs. I dont know how to get them out...

A1F0Z8J5KCDV5S,0,The Sony Discman has its benifits. but is a bad choice for the long run.  I have owned two of them in a 9 month period. the first failed to play within the first three months. and the seconds ESP didnt work after two  months and after 4 more months ceased to play at all.,2,0,271

A1F1ETT6Q22XMR,911,I just finished breaking this lock off my laptop because it somehow jammed.  My laptop was securely locked in my hotel room. keeping even a person with the combination from removing it.  After a couple of quick blows with a ratchet handle. the lock itself broke apart.  Once I took the end off the lock. it popped right off the laptop.  See my photos above of the smashed lock.When I bought this. I joked to my buddy that it would now take a thief 30 seconds longer to steal my laptop.  If only I had realized how right I was.  The only reason I spent half an hour trying to remove it was because I was trying to save the lock.  Ill call the manufacturer to ask for a refund tomorrow.  If they dont give me one. Ill take it back to Staples. where I bought this just six weeks ago.,1,0,780
A1F1F2EFH725LV,67,I have brought several products from Aamzon over the years. and it is the first time I have come across one that is a bad product.  It could be an issue with the specific one I brought.  The cable worked for few seconds and then it started creating output that was flickering.  After wriggling the ends I figured it worked after I hold the end connect to the camcorder bent at an angle that worked for 5 min. and then stopped working altogether.  I guess it was a loose contact at one of the ends.,1,0,497
A1F1JQFZZ4QNF0,22,Ive had a PMP300 for a little over a year now. and the only complaint I  have is with the transfer cable. I had to return the first unit I got as  the cable was defective. and now it seems to be failing again.I have a  32 meg flash card. and at 48k bitrate I can store 43 songs on my Rio. I  mostly listen to celtic and classical music to help me relax and drown out  distracting noises. and prefer a larger variety of music to nearCD  quality. 48k is supposedly AM radio quality. but I quess Im no audiophile  as it works for me.I will probably have to upgrade to a Rio500 or  something similar. but I wont go back to CD or even cassettes. Its small  enough to fit in a shirt or pants pocket. and it is skipfree unless you  bump it fairly hard.,4,1,745
A1F1Z7H5KN49K2,34,I purchased this unit just after Christmas.  I LOVE IT!

A1F3CTI26HFKOY,35,The Nook is great for reading books.  By all means. get the model with wifi and 3g.  Why?  3G is free .no monthly fee.. so you may download books anywhere whether wifi is available or not.  The Nook is not for everyone for example. the web browser is cumbersome. however. I believe that an ereader is not a jackofalltrades.  It should allow you to do one thing READ BOOKS.  I Love the quality of the display. page turn speed. available literature. and free books online.  The thing that got me interested in the Nook is its compatibility with EPUB.  There are so many free EPUB books online and at the library.  With Kindle. that is not an option.I believe that with technology. glitches sometimes occur. and I respect the fact that when problems arise. they have excellent support.  I did have some difficulty with my device.  After about 6 months. the display stopped working properly.  Barnes and Noble quickly rectified the situation at no cost to me.  They gave me a gift card for my trouble.  Every time I have had technical questions regarding downloading books. the customer service representatives have answered all my questions.I must add that the color Nook does not have 3G. so I would definitely recommend the wifi3G model. especially if you read a lot of novels.  I read a lot of novels on my nook and do not miss color at all.  .I read magazines in print or online with a bigger computer screen..  By the way. I read somewhere that eink technology will eventually be able to display  color.....,5,1,1509
A1F3QL13QBLWIV,1012,Very easy to install. this time DO read the manual. First the software then the hardware !  I got rid of a small hub with power supply u0026amp two network cables.

A1F5R62PZX2WZJ,1010,I bought the LandWare GoType! keyboard for my Palm IIIe organizer. and I was pleased with the results.1. The keyboard is small and lightweight. making it easy to carry. It even has a handle that pulls out of the back  which provides support while typing. and can be a carrying utensil also.  2. It has shortcut buttons to certain programs on your Palm that you can  even reprogram. For example. one button can take you right to your Memo  Pad. and another can take you to your address book. etc.3. One thing I  didnt really like was that it was small. and a little bit cramped. After  typing on a normal keyboard. going to the smaller keyboard is a little  hard. The keys are very small. and the shift key is in an inconvenient  place.  4. This is a good keyboard because it has a protective cover that  flips up. and while protecting the keyboard. it also provides support for  the Palm organizer to rest against while youre typing. so the organizer  doesnt fall out.This is a great product. and Id recommend it.,4,1,1013
A1F64GW1Y2MEZ8,0,The inserts work great with my CD packaging program. The SureThing inserts are higher quality paper which prints much brighter. but priced 40% higher. These memorex inserts are adequate.,4,1,186
A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX,44,My mom got me this CD player a couple years ago for Christmas and I have used it ever since.  It doesnt really have the features of the more expensive stereo systems such as bass boost. surround sound. etc... but the sound quality is a lot better than these other reviewers are making it out to be.it seems like the only people who ever review electronics are people who got ones that dont work..  It actually plays some of my CDs that are too scratched up for my expensive 45second ESP portable CD player which is great because otherwise I would have ended up buying a whole bunch of newer CDs.  I have noticed also that if it doesnt play a scratched CD the first time. it gets better with each time you play it.  God knows why that is. but Im not complaining.  Anyway. this CD player has pretty good sound .the part in Led Zeppelins What is and What Shall Never Be where the guitar goes back and forth between the left and right channels comes across great.. it plays scratched CDs. and you should buy it.,4,1,1007
A1F6EVAS8S3UJG,0,These headphones are perfect for teen bus rides or long trips where there is limited space for extras. Their sound quality was great for this type of headphone. Allinall. I gave these phones a four star rating for their  sound quality but somewhat uncomforatble earpieces.,4,1,272
A1F8ABPW3WRF6T,2931,It may not have all the cute features that you could want on a camera. but it makes up for it by being durable and rugged.  I just recently discovered the u0026quotWPu0026quot stands for weatherproof. not waterproof.  Ive been taking mine into the pool and into the ocean for years without a problem. although the camera has never been deeper than a few feet under the water. It is not sufficient if you are a serious scuba person. but for the traveler or outdoor enthusiast. this camera will greatly expand your picture taking abilities.  While I have several expensive. featureladen cameras. I often prefer to use this camera.  I find it has three advantages for me.  First. its ruggedness allows it to go places my expensive cameras cannot.  This includes the beach. on to boats. or into water.  You can throw this camera onto the sand or take it into the ocean for fun vacation shots.  Second. Im not worried about losing this camera. as I would be of losing a more expensive camera.  Not only is it moderately priced. but also you can slip it into a bathing suit pocket and swim with it.  You dont have to leave it on a towel and worry about it as you swim.  Thirdly. its small and lightweight.  Its not burdensome to carryaround.  For those times that you would like to get a snapshot. but you dont want to lug around a camera bag and a bunch of attachments. this camera is perfect.  And while youre carrying it. you dont have to worry about getting caught in the rain.While it may lack some features. its picture quality is surprisingly good.  If you are thinking that a waterproof disposable camera has the same advantages that I listed above .i.e.. waterproof with worryfree portability.. be advised there is a big difference in the quality of the prints.  Ive used both and you get much better pictures from this camera. It may not do everything that a fancier camera can do .zoom. macro. etc... but what it can do it does exceptionally well.  This camera has taken some of my favorite vacation snapshots and family pictures. if for no other reason than it was there with me when the picture opportunity presented itself while my u0026quotgoodu0026quot camera sat safely .and uselessly. packed away and protected.,5,1,2223
A1F8Y5BU9YHTBY,11,I picked this keyboard at random .mostly because its inexpensive. when I first decided to buy one due to tendinitis issues.  I think its great as far as comfort and ease of use .after the normal learning curve going from a normal keyboard to a splitergonomic board..  The only thing I dont like .and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.. as other reviewers mentioned. is the Power and Sleep keys at the upper right corner of the keyboard.  The Power key was the worst  its easy to bump. and if you do. the computer shuts down and theres nothing you can do about it.  My solution.  I just popped those keys off .all three at the upper right corner..  I made a little cover too. but thats probably overkill for most people.,4,1,721
A1F99HRYTA68CR,1,The only thing That upsets me is that there wasnt accurate information about this product before i purchased it .

A1F9YNY2KTBO5H,44,I use this card for my home network. and it has never given me trouble. I reccomend it for people wanting to quickly get a home network up and running. Provided you pay attention to the network configuration requirements for your particular OS. this card is most unlikely to give you trouble. If you think you have a card problem carefully recheck your config work a few times first before blaming the card.This card works great in Red Hat Linux AND Windows. It is the only Netgear card certified for Red Hat Linux 7. As a matter of fact Im ordering a 4th FA310TX card to replace a Linksys card right now. Im involved in Linux and am presently converting an Emachines box to a 100% Red Hat Linux 7 machine. I ran into trouble with the Linksys FastEthernet 10100 .Version 2. card in this box. It turns out Red Hat 7 can see that card. but not the Linksys chip. so I need to replace it. End of my use of Linksys cards .but they work just great in Windows networks and I have a complete Linksysbased network running for a client as well.. Ill probably stick to Netgear in the future.,5,1,1080
A1F9Z42CFF9IAY,1415,I cant add too much more to the positive comments other users have already posted on this little gem. Its the best point and shoot camera for the money. The fast f2.8 lens and shutter speed range from 4 seconds to 11000 sec. is something that youd be hard pressed to find in any other point and shoot camera. especially in this price range.Now for the tips.Turn off the flash while indoors. Your people pictures will look very colorful and nice.Force the flash on when outdoors. This will provide some nice fill flash and your people pictures will have their faces exposed nicely.Use the spot metering and focusing mode. Point the center crosshairs at what you want to focus and meter upon and then recompose your shot while holding the shutter button down halfway.When shooting at an event. keep the clam shell case open. The camera resets to full auto mode every time you close it. So. set it once and then just leave it open. sliding it into a shirt pocket or something. This way. it remains set and ready all night.,5,1,1019
A1FA1MRPUT8K6G,2626,I read alot of the reviews for this camera before I purchased it. Mostly I was concerned about the pic quality. but decided to get it anyway. It has two main modes. standard and email. Both modes produce fairly good quality  pics. perhaps not suitable for editing. but great for standard utility  shots to send to friends or use in online auctions. It takes the best pics  when the object is well lit pics are sometimes grainy when taken indoors  with low light. Overall. Id say that this camera offers what most people  need in a digital camera and I am glad that I didnt spend more. The pics  are high quality. the camera is easy to use. has very high battery life and  lots of functionality. Tip. buy a camera case right away.,4,1,729
A1FB9AE3CJE7QD,33,Havent gotten to use these yet. Kit seems good enough. But I bought this battery kit for my Bushnell Bone Collector Edition 200 Lumen HD Torch Flashlight and the batteries dont fit inside the flashlight.The battery tube in the light has very tight tolerances and regular batteries just fit. These rechargeable batteries begin to fit and then become stuck as they slide in. I had to drill into the batteries and extract them. I can see that there are slight differences in the body construction of these batteries when compared to the ones that ship with the light  and others I buy in twopacks from the grocery store. They must be slightly larger.Just a warning. in case this is your intended use for this recharge kit.,2,0,719

A1FFACWRR9ID28,0,My product didnt work. it kept telling me that it was skipping over damaged areas of DVDs that were completely undamaged in other DVD players. and as such it never actually played the movies. It seemed very poorly made. and I got a DVD stuck in it as the button to open it decided not to do anything on the third DVD I tried playing in it. I sent it back the same day I got it.,1,0,377

A1FGQRPA095HUG,4144,We bought this product partially for using vibrating infant seats also.  The reason NiMH batteries dont run as long is that they cannot store as much energy as alkalines.  The Energizer technical data sheets state that  the energy storage capacity is.Alk vs Rech  AAA 1150 vs 650. AA 2850 vs  1200. C 8350 vs 2200. D 18000 vs 2200. 9V 595 vs 150 .units are  milliAmpHours.So. even though alkalines D cells will last about 8  times longer and they cost half as much. if you can get 20 charges out of a  NiMH. it is worth it.  Since NiMHs supposedly have a 5001000 recharge life  cycle. its very much worth it to us to change the D cells 8 times more  often!  For the AAAs and AAs the difference is much less and even more  worth it!,5,1,731

A1FIR4LBQA39YR,0,The Nook preformed perfectly and was easy to set up. I checked lots of ratings before I ordered it. and they were all good.This was my first tablet so I did not realize that it did not have some of the specific features I was looking for. I did return it. I must say though that the camera on the Nook was much better than camera on my new one.,4,1,344
A1FKP3Z9VZQFTV,0,I bought this device to replace the charger that I lost. The original device would power up the Garmin .just as if you had plugged it into a car charger. and then if you turned it off. the screen would tell you that the unit was charging. THIS replacement unit does not do this. Instead. when you plug in this device. the Garmin appears to power on. but then you just see a graphic of a computer connected to the Garmin via a cable. I cant use the Garmin in this mode and I have no reason to believe that the batteries are charging. In other words. this thing is worthless.,1,0,573
A1FL16ZPAULG1O,0,I gave this item a 4 star. it is very colorful and I do like it. but the numbers and letters could be a little better.  But overall they are pretty cool.  Sure does brighten up my keypad.,4,1,187
A1FNHDWSN2KA0G,1115,I knew about the NOOK Color even before it was released and I was really excited about this ereader. because I own a Kindle 3 and Im part of the customers that think that it could offer more things and be more en par with the future. The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen. vivid view technology. brightness adjustments. really nice web browser and mp3 player. etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada. and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at Bu0026N and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didnt care. I just wanted my NC cause honestly Im just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight. Im an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read. mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways. I got the NC promptly. I was super excited. but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didnt recognize the units drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friends house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing. nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly. but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it. but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways. I said I didnt want that unit back. Now here I am. with no Nook Color. nobody else sends it to Canada. Im contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them. buying it straight from Bu0026N and then they can mail it to me. Its just weird that at this day and age we still cant have items shipped internationally. even when were willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now Im again using my Kindle like crazy. since its all I got and it never fails. But Im still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just dont know if Ill sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now. hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars. the NC is the best ereader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong. but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesnt come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen. I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a readers tablet. I would use it instead of using Bu0026Ns. However. that still hasnt happened and Jeff Bezos says he doesnt want that to happen just now. So Ill purchase a Nook Color and be happy with it.,3,0,2989

A1FRNK3L7L1G79,55,I think I could make a huge review. but I will try to keep this short and sweet. What Bu0026N has created here is a true gem. waiting to be uncovered by users.  As an ebook reader. it is just fine but really. it has the hardware to do so much more.  A little unlocking lets you at a fully specced tablet with great features.The best thing about this tablet is the community behind it. The developers at XDA Forums are amazing. and have custom Android builds to use with the system. Soon enough we may see full Gingerbread build. as well as a Honeycomb build. ..

A1FSD6V8Z7K8E9,44,I would not normally have purchased USD99 speakers for my computer. My first  thought was to spend half that. But in using a USD100 gift certificate for  Amazon.com. I only paid for sh. I am glad I ordered this set. The sound is  great. The trebles and midrange are brilliant and the base is robust. The  two sattelite speakers are small with the volume u0026amp power controls as  well as a headphone jack located on the front of the right speaker. I was  able to put the 3rd base unit under my desk. I would recommend this to  anyone who doesnt mind spending the extra money.,5,1,577
A1FTFVM4R9JRN7,0,I waited several months before reviewing these videotapes because I wanted to record on them a few times.  After recording on them and then rerecording on them they have not held up.  I have some videotapes which I have been recording on over and over again for years and the quality is better than these have been after only a few months.  If youre only planning on using them once or twice they are fine.  But for use over and over again they will degrade after 34 uses.,2,0,472

A1FVN80HHHR3RA,22,Well since most reviews have gone into the specifics of this device. I wont delve too deeply into those aspects. However. very rarely did I see any mention of how cheap of a device this is the plastic feels of very low grade. the reset button litterally rattles its so loose. Overall. yes the device works. so I wont knock it for that unfortunately I have no means of testing the actual surgeprotection. but I just have to hope that they used better quality electronic components then they used for the case build.Pros of the device.+Smart circle design obviously the main advantage of this is taht you are no longer limited by annoying power bricks taking upblocking outlets. For that it works great.+Cute design it looks slightly better than a normal surge protector with its circle form factor and brightly color coded outlets however. the design is slightly hindered by how cheap the materials are. and looks less cute in person.+Long cord 16ft is pretty long. so make sure you need that long of a cord. since the average cord length is around 68ft for a surge protector. Still for my application. a long cord is a plus .since I needed at least a 12ft cord..Cons.Really bad build quality again. just super cheap plastic. and the reset button is really wobbly. barely feels like its held on. The cord seems of decent gaugeinsulation at least. and the device has some heft so it may just be cheap on the exterior.No swivel outlet for the cost of this device. it really should come with a swivel outlet connection. so if your outlet is upsidedown .connected to a light switch. or you need it to go to the right of the socket. the cord will be tweaked in the wrong direction. I have no problems with cheap protectors not having a rotating outlet. but on something that costs almost USD40 it really should have included it.Summary.Look. if were rating the device on whether it provides power or not. of course it works. and should get 5 stars. The circle design is also very nice. and again worthy of some stars. But with how poor the build quality is on this .and this was ordered from Amazon directly. not 3rd party.. and the fact that they didnt even throw in nicer features like a swivel socket for how pricey this retails for. I cant give this a fantastic rating .but will still give it an OK rating as it does in fact work. but that alone doesnt deserve 5 stars.. I purchased the device on a CyberMonday sale. and even at the significantlyreducted price Im still debating on if I should keep it or not. I have several surge protectors from all sorts of brands. and as such Im somewhat disappointed with what should have been a nicer protector feeling and looking so cheap. Id say for a sale price it might be worth it. or if youre really looking for a longer cord surge protector it might be worth it .although I have several longercord protectors that didnt cost near this much.. but Ive purchased much better protectors at even better prices when they go on sale.,3,0,2970
A1FW2MI26QT01R,77,My Allsop 60000 3in1 .wet. Video Cleaner came with a dryempty squeeze bottle of cleaning solution. Without the cleaning solution the cassette with a cleaning ribbon cannot be used. This is the 2nd time this has happen. First one I returned for a replacement. The replacement I received also came with a dryempty squeeze bottle of cleaning solution. which I am returning for a refund.I think I was sold an old Allsop 60000 3in1 .wet. Video Cleaner that was storied in a warehouse for years and the cleaning solution in the package evaporated. I doubt if Allsop is still manufacturing this product. Amazon should check their stock of Allsop 60000 3in1 .wet. Video Cleaner before selling more of it.,1,0,696

A1G29BYYKXJZVS,22,I have ordered my Nook from Amazon. First problem was the charging. Manuals told me to charge it for three and a half hours maximum. I could not use it for more then two days while it was charging continuously.!. from my computer.It was annoying.In the first two weeks I could not read anything. because of the lack of the wifi access.It is funny in case of an ebook reader.Then I had to add my email address and a valid bank account and other identifications. They needed too many personal data. before using the tool.It is also funny in case of an ebook reader.The PDF files that I copied to Nook  were not readable. I could recognise the titles only.That was the third funny experiance.Then after two weeks. while I left the Nook alone. I noticed that I have a new ebook and I could open the files. that I could not before.Next funny thing. After using it normally for a few weeks. once tapping did not work. I charged it and it worked again. I thought that tapping does not work well. when the battery is flat.Funny. but acceptable.It used it for a few hours. and had the same problem at tapping. I even could not reach my files. because tapping needs for opening the tools. No other way. If tapping does not work. you can not reach your ebooks. however there are some phisical buttom on the tool. also.Funny and annoying.Now the situation is . sometimes it does sense the tapping. sometimes doesnt.Final annoying concern. spam mail per almost every day. about how to spend your money on ebooks and related things.Favourites beyond all negatives.Nice .

A1G9L2BT6DTE95,33,After reading the reviews on the page for this page. I decided to see one for myself at a local CompUSA. The design is great. small and trendy. but  it does have several drawbacks.The notebook sleve. as others have  already mentioned. is layered with a thin piece of felt. While it provides  a nice and fuzzy place for the notebook. it is thin and suspect to easy  ripping.Second. the backpack straps on this bag are very unpadded and  make the backpack rest on the upper back. Depending on how you like to wear  backpacks. this may impact your like or dislike of the prodduct.Lastly.  the bag is small. This is not a bag a student can carry wtih all his or her  boosk inside. Its made for a notebook and some accessories. with maybe a  couple files or small books. For something similar to this but with more  space for textbooks. you may want to look at the Amazon.com Messenger Bag.,3,0,885

A1GC9NWZ58650L,11,I bought this mp3 player thinking I was going to be on the cutting edge. What i ended up with was an ok piece of hardware that just wasnt worth the money  only 1 hour of music? What a waste! BUT. the worst part was that it  was so flimsy that it broke within the first week! I dropped it about 1  foot  not on a hard floor. but on a soft carpeted floor. and that tiny  fall completely killed it. It wouldnt turn on. So i had amazon.com send me  another one. Guess what happened after i got a new one. The exact same  thing. 2 weeks later. So i returned it for a refund and am now going to  wait for portable mp3 players to get better and cheaper.,2,0,646
A1GD66BG1VKW7X,0,I put my Kindle in my work backpack so a cover must be strong.  The cover does the trick.  Looks nice too.  Its not particularly light. but I need to strength more so that compromise was easy to make.,4,1,200
A1GE6AROZ4IEAJ,79,I used this radio on 2000 mile 4 day trip on my harley and worked good the whole time. keep in mind though it only has a 4 watt output so range is lacking compaired to the other bikes i was with.,4,0,195
A1GEN2ZI0TQW5,0,I liked it for the week we had it lol. Husband didnt tell me he was buying a 55 inch a week after we got this installed! Worked well and great price!,4,1,149
A1GEQY4YAV6Q7P,56,I bought this radio to get AM reception in Britain from Irish RTE radio 1 in Dublin. It works excellently without the need for addon antennas. It is much better than the Sangean CCradio plus for reception in my experience. It is not a particularly sleek or sexylooking radio and with no digital tuning. it is oldfashioned. However. its ability to get good reception at long range makes up for those deficiencies. Quite cheap too for such a powerful and reliable radio.,4,1,468
A1GFMTK4GVGKXF,6772,This is a great DVD player.  Only one problem really. This DVD player only supports 96khz24bit ANALOG output.  It downsamples on the DIGITAL output.  Sony did this to prevent piracy.,4,0,182

A1GI10W19I11ZZ,0,Convenient radio. easy to program and use. Reception fairly good in most areas of the house in which it is used. Placing against a wall or window improves reception. The only thing I would of liked to have seen on it is some kind of antenna.,4,1,241
A1GIOGPH03481Z,1421,I cant imagine someone using these little creatures as primary front speakers. but for rear surround speakers they are a perfect fit.  Additionally. you cant beat the price.

A1GIOGPH03481Z,1213,I purchase this item for myself for Christmas.  I will admit  I boutght this gadget because of commercial on TV with the guy walking around the apartment computing distances and travel times to various locations.  A GPS  unit is an absolute must for u0026quotdata geeksu0026quot.  I love being able to  utilize all of the useful .useless. information that this little unit  provides.

A1GJ0LO7VR2B0L,4141,This product is without a doubt a great buy. The hardware is of great quality. and can capture at respectale resolutions and frame rates with very little signal loss. The installation is a snap. And then the price... less than 40 bucks to turn your pc into a television and video studio? beautiful. but before you go out and buy this. here are some suggestions.DO NOT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS USE THE SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH THE CARD. their PCTV Studio is a joke. It refuses you the right to keep your files uncompressed .temporarily. and greatly limits your options. For your video capture and editing needs. check out VirtualDub for capturing .any web search should find it for you. which is freeware and by far the best capturing program out there. For editng. i suggest QuickEditor .prmeiere is better. but costs .more.. it allows very simple trim. cut. and copy editing with great transitions. effects. and soundtracking...For your TV viewing needs. the software bundled with the card is respectable. but still buggy .i have yet been successful in getting it to fullscreen mode without pink screenitis. i suggest sticking with it. as it provides some good features usch as u0026quotchannel surfu0026quot and is free of charge. So. in conclusion. go out and buy this card....you will have all you need for professional internet and cdrom video.,3,0,1342
A1GJQE89OSYQRI,0,Works but is bulky not fun to have on a walk or run not good when working in the yard or on the job just to big but is not bad on the camping trip at the end of the day or on the range after a day of working the farm war it is unpractical to have a stereo system.,3,0,263
A1GK5KVLHRG22W,0,Bought this for my car club drives .Best way to keep in touch with the other drivers.. Simple to use. Backlit display is easy to see. Buttons also light up. Nice clear sound. I would recommend an external antenna. Range is only about a mile or so with the included little stubby rubber one. Nice little CB radio. Perfect for my needs. Like it very much.,4,1,353
A1GKT9WP4CWYXL,0,weeks after I purchased it. the device stopped working.  I will not purchase electronic items online again.  not worth it.,1,0,122
A1GLHE8QE65D0W,11,Compared to mounts I have used on other display panels. this is very poor quality. Motion joints have unpredictable friction. Loosening or tightening joints is good for one or two motions. then they loosen more or become sticky. I would not mount a USD600 display on such a poorly made mount. I have returned it to Amazon. Return process was very easy. High marks for that!,1,0,373
A1GLLNBXY06HCL,11,I wanted to buy an ebook and decided on a nook. Broke in 3 months. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. I tried to get support and the company refused to help me.

Go with a Kindle or a Sony.,1,0,352
A1GLMR6A34M0VV,0,Bought 2 of these thinking theyd be be similar to traditional head cleaning tapes that might play for 5 minutes before a rewind is required. These dogs run maybe 30 seconds giving a possible 2 supposed cleanings before rewind. The cleaning tape doesnt appear any different than video tape and any improvement in video playback was mostly imagined. Went back to using a 20 year old cleaning tape.This product is a DOG DOG DOG and stink youll stir up after stepping in this turd hangs around for weeks.,1,0,500
A1GLWTPQG5D6LY,7482,I use a Sony MVCFD91 at work and I love it. but I wanted something a little smaller for my personal use and bought a Nikon Coolpix 950. I have Nikon 35mm cameras and like them. My Coolpix camera works fine and picture  quality is good. but. except for size. I think the Sony is superior in  almost every way.My biggest gripes about the Nikon are the cheesy.  printityourself manual and absolutely maddening software that come with  it. The printyourown instructions with the software are very confusing  and I dont believe I ever successfully printed the entire manual. I have  also never figured out how to download the camera itself .I cant get the  program to recognize the camera..  I ended up buying a Compact Flash reader  .if I were designing a camera. Compact Flash would be dead last on my list  of preferred memory cards.. and another software program which adds a  couple hundred dollars or more to the price of the camera. A decent sized  Compact Flash card will add another hundred or so .and then there are the  batteries and charger.. If you take this camera on a vacation. youll need  to bring your computer or several hundred dollars worth of memory  cards.For a camera in this price range. I think Nikon would be wise  include decent. already printed manuals and userfriendly software.,3,0,1303
A1GOI1QFNYM3EL,44,I have always been convinced that a paper planner like Day Timer is a superior way to organize your life because you can see the big picture.  I recently got a Palm V and realize I was wrong.  This is a phenomenal device  for organizing yourself.  Others reviewers have already described the main  benefits of the Palm System.  I work with a lot of patients with attention  deficit disorder and usually have to focus on organization skills.  It is  critical to have all you organizing stuff in one place. and to have that  with you all. repeat. all the time.  The are few reasons not to carry this  one .if you have pockets..  I have mine in my pants pocket .even jeans. 24  hours a day.  The extra money is not for good looks but for the advantage  of the smallest portable device.Learn to use the timer you remind you  .even nag you. of what you need to do .it will go off 10 times..The  solution to the buttons going off in your pocket is to lock it. especially  easily done with Launcher III.  Or using preferences you can assign a  button or penstroke all the way up the screen to shut it off. I have a mac.  and I have had no trouble with the interface and have downloaded some very  useful programs. the best being WhatzUp. Actioneer. and QuickNotes.  You  can download books as well.  I went to Spain and had a whole dictionary and  currency converter in it.  2 or 2.8 Mb goes a long way.  Remember that this  is a PDA. not a substitute for a desktop computerUse the internet to  find out how to customize your Palm. starting at the Palm site.,5,1,1551
A1GP0HY8E2XKWN,1838,I am continually amazed at the pictures this camera produces. Depth of field is very good.  I have not tried the storage space on the camera but I understand 999 pictures can be stored to a folder.  This would work well for long vacations. I prefer to size and save to disks. I use the SanDisk Image Mate with it and am very pleased with the speed I can be viewing my  pictures.,5,1,378

A1GRYKT7TUE9CE,0,After owning a Teac tape recorder since 1983 that I was very happy with. I wanted a second one so I purchased this unit. What a dissapointment.

A1GTLEK3VHN6R2,0,I purchased this to get my camera ready for vacation and I received an MP3 charger that did not work with my camera. I was very disappointed. and was unable to take any pictures on my trip!,2,0,189
A1GTV9NNRLOBFT,1522,I thought it was a mistake when a friend told me about he features this camera had at this price. This is my second camera. my first being a Vivitar vivicam 2700 .which I paid USD349. for. Which was very difficult to hook up and download pictures. This AGFA with its USB connection could not  have been easier. And the picture quality!  My Vivitar was 640x480 this is  better than twice as good!  Thanks,5,1,403
A1GU5ZJEZRSZLY,3439,We are headed on vacation in a couple of weeks and I thought it would be a good time to get a lightweight compact camera.  I had heard good things  about the elf. and although I hadnt ever tried APS film I thought this  would be a good time. I shot 3 rolls of film. in all kinds of lighting  conditions.  I tried indoors. outdoors. sunny days. after dark and cloudy  days.  I have to tell you that repeatedly it felt like the pictures were  overexposed.  The elfs ability to balance exposure to suit a setting  really goes haywire when it has to balance higher contrast.  The redeye  feature didnt work so swell. and my pictures just werent up to par.  We  are returning it and going digital.  I bought the digital elf and shot  several shots. printed them and they give me the pictures. color and  resolution I am looking for.  I think this little camera was a bit  overhyped.,2,0,877
A1GU9UYBOO6P94,0,I have used Kingston memory devices for quite a while and always find the performance as specified and the price competitive.  As is my usual experience with Amazon and their suppliers. the product arrived on time and well packaged.,4,1,232
A1GUJ1B0UQTGDU,44,Great product for the money. The only complaint or issue I kind of have is that the cord could be a little longer. Plus with the radio I use the plug has a tendency to come out if the cord is pulled to far or stretched out. It depends on how you choose to wear it if this will be a problem for you or not. Even with this issue I still would buy it again.,5,1,354
A1GVC2KDV7OB2I,33,Like many of you who purchased the Yamaha YSTMS50. I had to do alot of homework to make the decision to buy these speakers.  I bascialy wanted to upgrade to a highfidelty setup .not necesarily audiophile quality. for my new apartment and would not exceed ...... I once encountered these speakers before when I bought a another Yamaha model almost 3 years ago. They sounded incredible but I simply did not have the .... dollars to spend on a pair of speakers at the time. So when I was going through my decisions. these speakers were at the top of my list.  At first I was thinking of trying something like the Altec Lansing 621. But they were a bit pricey. After seeing the Yamaha on Ebay. I couldnt help but try for it.  And these speakers ended up being the best... dollars .after an interesting scenario that happened to my seller. would of been .... I ever spent on anything! While these speakers are not quite the audiophile crowd. it definately comes very close .more close than alot of speakers in this price range.  But Im nonetheless struck by the smooth and warm sound of these speakers.  Im very glad I stuck with Yamaha again.  These speakers show what Yamahas audio expertise is all about.  Rock on!,5,1,1212
A1GVGMI6WT6HVC,1820,I have had no problems with the Delkin card.  I purchased a Sandisk card and found that my camera would not recognize it.

A1GVV3B4QYMNR8,33,I bought this cd player as my first portable.  For 50 bucks it sure works great.  The headphones seem a little dinky but they sound great.  It misss a viewing window for the cd though.  The stuff it comes with is pretty  awsome too.,4,1,232
A1GWS2NJ324IY1,512,I finally was convinced that I could enjoy an eBook reader. did my research. and settled on the Nook Color.  My goal was to be able to carry a few books around for pleasure. maybe even some business documents.  Even though I have an iPhone. I thought I would diversify and go after an Android based platform.  I figured that even if I decided to go with the iPad eventually I could use the Nook app on the iPad to read the books that Ive bought.After a few weeks of using it. Im close to handing it over to the kids or jailbreaking it for experimentation with Android. and getting an iPad.1. The quality is low.  The software is buggy. ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book. where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo.  The battery charge socket seems to be flakey. so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now.2. Cant buy books when youre outside the US.  So. on an international business trip  when itd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe  one cant buy a book.  That sucks.3. Although in theory I could load a bunch of PDF documents onto it for reading. the display is too small for them.  The interface for PDF documents. in terms of adjusting fonts. scrolling. is very limited.  Device is useless for this.4. The book selection is slim.  I dont think my tastes are that obscure. but Im not interested in the mass market.  Forget pulling out old sci fi classics.  Forget getting a textbook.  And I find that some of the books that I would like to read are available for the Kindle but not the Nook.5. The iPhone Nook app is super buggy.  In theory it should let me sync. get my books on the iPhone too.  But the iPhone app just hangs and doesnt sync to my account. even after a reinstall.  If you read the reviews of the Nook app on the app store. theyre all saying this.6. The App selection is slim.  Email doesnt work with outlook and theres no VPN support.Better to just get an iPad. clearly.,2,0,2020

A1GZ39UKG2CHD,38,These are the best speakers i have ever had. I love them. Anyone who wants to upgrade their front speakers. but these. They have a lot of bass and the best treble ever. Very clear and natural sounds come from these speakers. I think they look awesome too!  You cant beat the price. Thanx Amazon. These speakers are not part of the greatest. they are the greatest themselves. You dont even need a powered subwoofer. these speakers have a lot of bass.BUY THEM NOW !HIGHLY RECOMENDED!Flipmode is the greatest!,5,1,506
A1GZSZISEPVR6G,7593,I just received this system a while ago and I think it is a VERY powerful.VERY sophisticated looking stereo.With 299 watts of total power it gives you the major bass according to how you have it  preset..Rock.Jazz.Pop.Classic.etc..I have it in my room and it looks great  and it gives you THE REAL surround sound sensation.I could go on and on  with all the details. but youll have to buy it yourself to experience  it.If you buy this stereo I can promise you. youll be VERY happy with it.,5,1,489
A1H1KPMWL5CB2M,11,This camera was a great asset to our engineering department. We used it extensively outdoors and at nite in northern Illinois. It gave us the capability to communicate via company intranet in a very fast and accurate manner technical data when we used a reference template in photos..Many cudos to this photo machine.,4,1,317
A1H1VRPWQKVEGN,1416,For the price. USD149.99 which I paid for my 16GB Nook HD+. this device is hard to beat.  The display sports a very good pictureone of the best I have seenand the OS is pretty smooth with only some occasional lag. which might be an issue with certain apps.  When I opened my Nook and fired it up. Google Play had not been installed.  After a quick software update. Play appeared which allows me to download a great deal of Android apps onto this device.  I have since added all the apps which I consider to be essential. for me. and all of them work nicely.  As for the feeldesign. its nice.  The tablet isnt too heavy or too light. and all the buttons are placed nicely for ease of access.  Even better. this unit has a micro SD slot to expand memory.  The only thing missing from the last tablet I had. that I can tell. is the cameraand honestly. I dont care about that.  Cameras typically arent that great on tablets anyway.My only issue with this tablet is the feel of the screen.  While it has one of the best pictures of any tablet I have seen. the way the screen feels when you slide your finger across it is. well. just not a smooth feel.  The screen picks up fingerprints very easily as well.  As of now. I have a Nook matte screen protector on mine. which makes it feel more like a GPS screen. but I imagine once I add a high quality glossy protector. this issue will be resolved.Bottom line.  if youre looking for an affordable tablet for reading and downloading Android apps. give this one a try.  Im a pretty harsh critic of such things. and after having mine for about a week. I am loving it more and more each day.,4,1,1629
A1H21C73JD0VYB,1010,I have this unit hooked up to my home theater since Christmas and Im very happy with it. Id like to clear up some slight confusion about what previous reviews here have stated about using either Svideo OR composite video. but not both at the same time. I have tested it extensively. and you CAN hook up both at the same time. However. it is also true that this box does NOT do conversion. So how does this box handle this delema??? Very simple. Whatever video you put in. thats what you get out. IF YOU PUT BOTH SVIDEO AND COMPOSITE VIDEO IN AT THE SAME TIME. THEN YOU GET BOTH SVIDEO AND COMPOSTIE VIDEO OUT BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. SVideo comes out of the SVideo. and Compostite video comes out of the composite video port. There is NO conversion from one to the other. That means that any composite video IN devices will not go out the Svideo OUT port. and vice versa. If you hook up both and you have a TV that dectects which one is currently sending a signal. you wont notice any problem. I personally have a tv that SVideo over rides the composite. So I only use this box for SVideo because EVEN THOUGH THIS BOX IS SENDING THE COMPOSITE VIDEO. MY TV ISNT ACCEPTING IT. Youll have to see how your equipment works and decide if you need a box with conversion ability.About using the remote. it AUTOMATICALLY works with all of my RCA devices. I didnt have to even program it!! If you have RCA then great. if not then I cant comment personally.This unit is also nicely labeled. very attractive in appearance. and has SIX inputs which is nice. If it performed conversion and had an second output .it has One output. Id give it 5+++ stars. As it currently is. its a solid 4 stars in my book .as long as you calculate ahead of time if its abilities are consistent with your equipment and your needs of course..,4,1,1807
A1H2BMTLJEXKUS,0,I received the same unit as a gift to go with my hp laptop and was able to get it working with Geek Squad online technical assistance.  It helped that I had read the customer reviews which explained that it needed vlc player installed to watch dvds. Its working great.  However. this survey rating is based on my experience with the same unit I ordered for my daughters Toshiba Satellite U845S406 14  laptop.  As with my laptop. it didnt come with a CD drive so we needed external drives.  The unit looked identical to the one I received as a gift except the USB cord connection was a little different but connected fine.  For some reason. online technical assistance could not get the unit to work.  The DVD keeps ejecting without playing.  Best Buy Geek Squad said the unit is not compatible with the Toshiba computer. but I find that hard to believe because it has Windows7 installed.  Any suggestions?  If I can get it working. Ill update the rating.,3,0,954
A1H4JQ1P60SG2,23,The SONY ICFS79V shower radio provides good reception on my favorite FM and AM stations and local TV and weather stations .in MY bathroom anyway.. seems quite resistant to being splashed and seems to have long battery life. Three design changes I strongly recommend.1. Longterm experience shows that the most vulnerable part of this radio is the top surface membrane. which covers the pushbutton controls. This membrane is too easily punctured with a sharp fingernail. The puncture allows entry of water. which inactivates the control. Repair involves drying the area completely and sealing the puncture with lacquer or the like. A much tougher membrane is in order.2. The radio should use 6 .3 pairs of. AA cells rather than the .hardertofind and more likely to become obsolete. 3 C cells it presently uses.3. A tone control would be very useful. Shifting the sound output to the treble end would improve speech intelligibility in many broadcasts.,4,1,948

A1HDUJCILHK072,79,I have spent hours on the phone with customer service trying to download books.  The first two times I downloaded I had no problems at all.  The next 4 experiences were awful.  The Nook wouldnt receive the content.  I called Customer Service  while extremely polite and concerned with my problems  only one of my experiences resulted in my receiving the books I had ordered. I was told that I should try to connect to a different WIFI or that there was a lot of traffic on the Bu0026N servers.  Seriously? This is not helpful. The whole reason I wanted an eReader was so that I could get content on my own schedule without having to drive somewhere.  I am so frustrated with this device than I am returning it.  It was so promising when I received it as a Christmas gift.  Now. Im just a frustrated reader.,1,0,806

A1HEG85E3DLJY6,33,Ive been using the Model 64221 Orbit for over five years on a daily basis until the button failed.  Clicking it once results in a double click about half the time.  Cleaning it was never a big deal for me .takes less than a minute. once per month..  Now Im deciding between the old orbit and the new optical orbit.  I think Ill stick with the old design based on my experience with it.,5,1,385

A1HFOCQ0J1JYQM,1324,I recently came across the topoftheline sony portable minidisc recorderplayer and used it for a while. my conclusions from this trial of this format are. Pros. small. lightweight. easily portable. rewritable.  easy to useCons. terrible sound quality .Sony would have you believe  that it produces perfect CD quality or better sound. but dont believe  them. minidisc is a very low bitrate. meaning that at lower recording  volumes it will sound very good. but as the recording level and frequency  range increases. it becomes more and more grainy and digital sounding.. bad  interface. very expensive.I have an extremely highend stereo system  .Mark Levinson. Krell. Bu0026ampW. rega. which I hooked this player up to.  using my USD15.000 Mark Levinson Digital To Analog converter. and from my  USD15.000 Mark Levinson CD player. made some copies. and played them back.  That is about the best quality minidisc will ever be. and it sounded  terrible. like a USD50 Sony CD player. even with more than USD70.000 worth of  audio equipment behind it. it still sounded vile. harsh and grainy. Another  problem with it is the digital interface it uses. they should offer coaxial  digital outputs to enhance the sound quality a little bit. it isnt a big  strech. especially because sony invented the system. they try to pass EIAJ  optical off as a viable. highend format. All in all. I think that you  should stay with CD. even though it is large. it is not worth the huge  investment to go to minidisc. if you want a portable system. but dont care  about sound quality. go with MP3.,1,0,1575
A1HH9AB1ZHMTZZ,44,We bought the nook HD white for our children... I love how easy it is to use... I also like that each child has their own section... They click on their name and the apps that they can use are there for them... I also use the tablet for the internet and netflix... We do use it for reading some,5,1,294
A1HHP0AL66WYA9,34,When you need a hub and not a switch. this is what you need. It is perfect for running Wireshark. At this price I should have bought an extra one. The one I received works great and looks brand new with no scratches or scuffs.,5,1,226
A1HIOG0DOWHGM2,0,this cable made it possible to connect my tablet to my big flat screen. so i could see videos better,4,1,100
A1HIPHCHHTXKLV,11,I needed this unit to switch between different TiVos. The TiVos each can be set for a different IR set. But this unit would not learn any TiVo IR setting. What I had used previously  Radio Shack Audio Video Selector 151977  had no problem with TiVo IR sets. I had to set TiVo remote. which can control different TV brands .OnOff. Volume. Input select. to some TV brand I dont own and use the TV volume to switch between different TiVos. But this means now some of the TiVo remotes cannot control volume or switch between TV inputs like I was used to with the Radio Shack Audio Video Selector 151977.The TV picture is good with this unit. The unit has a nice appearance. The front connections can be useful at times. If it had done what I needed it would have been worth the price. but now the TV control buttons for different TiVo remotes do different things. where with the Radio Shack Audio Video Selector 151977. they all did the same thing. just for different TiVo remotesTiVos.,2,0,982
A1HKB094JF9E69,99,Bought one of these from Circuit City and returned it 3 days later.  The  SW freezes up  the clarity is terrible. and it uses four batteries per  download.  Sorry!,1,0,163
A1HKB0CZ226VFF,11,This light is great in lots of ways  its flexible. its small. its battery operated. but I find that sometimes there just isnt quite enough light to read by.  I end up having to move the light around the  page  of my nook in order to be able to see everything clearly.  On the up side though. it doesnt disturb my bedmate when I use it.,3,0,335
A1HKHX9E58OSLX,0,I bought this for my daughter was a little skeptical of buying it because  it was a used tablet but it was in great condition. I am thinking about getting one for myself. So I was very satisfied with this tablet..,4,1,213
A1HKV62CDKQ5A1,215,Does nothin. always has glitches. and apps are overly priced. I would rather buy a Motorola Xoom Family Editon at Best Buy for USD399.,1,0,134
A1HL9EHP97LG5W,0,Ill be honest when I ordered this stylus. I wasnt expecting what I got. I thought Id probably recieve a poorly made stick that wouldnt even work right with my iPhone. but instead. I got a small stylus that works perfectly fine. No. it may not be worth more than USD5. but it sure is worth the 38 cents I spent on it. Also. I recieved it a few days before it was supposed to arrive.,4,1,381
A1HLGBNPUKAM6C,11,I agree with most of the reviews. this modem just isnt even worth the USD9.99 I paid.  I havent had any problems installing the modem. but it doesnt seem to make a connection in less than 5 attempts.  Then the  fastest it connects ever is at 28800. but usually it is at 21600.  I  downloaded the new drivers from the manufactuers web site and cannot get  them to load no matter what I try.  Im going to get a decent modem as soon  as I save some dough.  Dont waste your time or money on this dog. it  should be put to sleep!  If there was an option for no stars I would rate  it that way.,1,0,588
A1HMCT742DUIQH,3131,Purchased this unit in September 99. It worked with no glitches or misshaps for 4 months. until I tried to play u0026quotRazor Blade Smileu0026quot. Honestly. I was surprised at JVC. this is very unusual from a top notch company. I disconnected the unit and walked into their service center .Im  only 8 mi away from JVC headquarters.. I picked it up two days later with a  new set of instructions attached to it. The instructions are for programing  the machine to play the following movies. Arlington Road.Razor Blade  Smile.  Cruel Intentions.  .There are another two obscure titles.  ONLY..Reason. JVCs parental lock gets activated when on of these movies  is inserted. Due to their unusual encoding it will lock the machine from  the grownups too. Dont fear. is not fried. If it happens again. which it  did with u0026quotRazor Blade Smileu0026quot the instructions let me reset  parental lock and watch the movie. Honestly. I could not ask for a better  DVD player. We play an average of 67 DVDs per week.  There are a lot of great machines out in the marketplace.  but to me JVC has always presented the best value in quality and service.,5,1,1144

A1HNWWWMX046GY,2525,Very pleased with the unit.  Quite sensitive and provides more than ample warning for any reasonable driver.  Digital display is good. easy to interpret. Voice signal could be louder. SWS is nice feature.  Got good  advanced warning of accident scene.,4,1,251
A1HNXJ9G3ZPR83,24,Unfortunately this item didnt work at all straight out of the box.  Spoke with tech rep from manufacturer and trouble shot the speaker system to no avail.  Luckily for me Advent happily accepted the return and upgraded me to the Acoustic Research Speaker. model AW811 which works wonderfully!,1,0,292
A1HONR16C57D6W,1,The only thing that I got out of this head cleaner was  snow  on the television screen! It is THE worst product that I have ever purchased online! Before submitting this rating. I attempted to return same. however. my reason .which was  product is defectiveu00268220. for wanting to return was not being accepted. Now I am stuck with this piece of junk!

A1HP0N7ZFE2FUF,0,This was exactly what I was looking for in a memory card and needed for my Garmin Nuvi GPS unit.,4,0,96
A1HPAQ4N17DJ2M,11,Well yes it is a Mp3 Player... and I have used it for three years... but now I cant get support for it from either Sonic blue OR RIo.  Like this product has been completely abandoned... they told me that I would either have to downgrade my operating system or buy a new player.  Niether solution is a very good way to treat your customers and they have completely lost me.  Now I desperatly search the internet for a alternative softwear package.  DONT DO IT!!! LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE!!!!,2,0,487
A1HQO42E2LQR8U,22,I purchase this for the phone connection to the DISH receiver. The product was easy to install and worked properly for about two days before it lost the connection.  I reinstalled and again it worked for about two days before it again lost connection.  So I gave up.  There is no troubleshooting guide for this problem nor could I find anything on the web.,1,0,356
A1HR5UTQTMJP79,13,I didnt purchase the NOOK through amazon I bought from the Barnes and Noble Store. I bought as a gift to my husband. I also bought the download of a book. Unfortunately the book I bought had a common title and the book purchased wasnt the book my husband wanted. We didnt even tried to download to the Nook. We went to the store and asked them if they could exchange the book .As we all know it is a question of clicking buttons in the system. The store said they couldnt do it. we needed to call the 1800 number to resolve the issue. We called the 1800 number and they said to go to the store. We are talking about an electronic transaction. not a printed book. Well We are going back to the store to return the NOOK. We would rather loose the money paid for the download than have to stay with a service you cant trust. We will never ever purchase again from Barnes and Noble. I would suggest you to do the same. I never had problems in Amazon purchases.,1,0,956
A1HR7A3OGPLJZV,0,This does the job.  I use my VHS player alot. so it is nice to clean it once in awhile to make it work better.,4,1,110
A1HRZF7BQSCLUC,0,This is a great quality mount. very strong and very good price! Diffenately plan on buying another mount for my other flat screen.,4,1,130
A1HSCY90PA6QW0,35,This is the worlds greatest keyboard.  Before I got it I had trouble using a keyboard due to the acute angle it forced my wrists into.  With the Natural Keyboard I can type much faster and with no discomfort. There is of course a learning curve with it as with any new piece of equipment. but that is overcome with practice.  Also the 6 key is not placed on the wrong side as one other reviewer claims. it is placed exactly where I expect it to be. I think any large handed person will quickly become very fond of this keyboards layout.,5,1,536
A1HU22YRSZ4EKQ,33,This item I ordered does work. but does not allow me to view any files. Basically its a great charger. When I plugged it in. it automatically installed the drivers for it. Dont really understand why. because I couldnt access anything on the cell phone. I cant really say anything about using it as a modem though. because I dont have service on the phone to try that out. If it does. then its really a great bargain. I like it anyway. because I can charge my LG 290C while on my computer.,3,0,488
A1HU2D2Q71O185,3032,I was hesitant to buy the lower end DVD players but I feel much better about that decision now.  This is a superb DVD player with all the goodies.  I believe that you should buy a low end DVD and put all the technology in  your receiver.  Thus. you do not need to buy a USD500 DVD player with 5.1  technology.  They key is the receiver.  As long as you buy a good receiver  with 5.1 and DTS. your prayers will be answered.  I also suggest the  Monster Cable for superb quality.  I tried it both ways and Monster is the  best.  Worth the USD30.00 investment.  So far. the Matrix has been the best  DVD to watch on this player.  Not to mention the excellent sound I get from  audio CDs.,5,1,684
A1HUJIKQWTU4UF,0,Had to replace. so I ordered two more. I do like this item. when hunting. I like that it has a clip. so you can attach to your clothes. This way you are not searching for the mic piece. The ear piece fits in your ear fairly well. The only reason I replaced it is because lost one. and the other one the cover was off the ear piece. If needed I would buy again,4,1,359
A1HV54JNKGX82G,12,An awesome product. Very reliable and I love how it upgrades itself. The new apps make it even better. with calendars. games. and news updates. I would definitely recommend this over any eReader any day!,5,1,203
A1HWN52YKK3I26,12,The batteries go out after about 20 pictures.Its not worth it..,2,0,63

A1HX6S5G24T01Y,44,We used it with this voice email program called TalkSender.com  It worked just fine with it... I wouldnt use it for voice recognition. but with Talksender. I didnt need the voice recog anymore cos I was sending voice  emails instead.,4,1,233
A1HXK6RCMLOLXS,55,I received an email from the company stating that they erroneously listed the 16gb tablet for USD99 but they could send me an 8gb tablet with a USD10 credit or cancel my order.  When I contacted the company about the 16gb tablet I was told they were out of stock and there was nothing they could do. However.  their website clearly had a 16gb tab and would allow me to order it. When I brought this to their attention the response was short and non apologetic.  It simply stated that I should be assured that they did not have it in Stock and that I could have the 8gb with USD10 refund or cancel my order. Since this was a cyber Monday deal and it was now 3 days later I could have gotten this deal from a number of places. I did receive a very nice email from them after the fact stating that they were happy to have resolved this issue to my complete satisfaction and that they will be happy to see my great review of them on Amazon.  This company has a lot to be desired when it comes to customer service. I will not be doing business with them in the future.,1,0,1063
A1HXS8E6R46UVD,0,I think I ordered the wrong case!  It is nice quality. just as pictured. but we have the old generation kindle fire. and I think this was made for the new...,4,1,157
A1HZ4LZRN79RVD,12,I wasted USD9 on this.  It is too low a voltage and current for most devices.  This is not up to Energizer standards.,1,0,117
A1HZIKS8JFCM9U,22,performs well.  I use it in the car exclusively.  Seldom a skip.  The only problem is the buttons are a little small for use in the car. and back lighting would help for nightime.  But you get used to it.,4,1,204
A1HZJP6WF7A97T,46,I purchased this when I purchased my Garmin 205 thinking I would need it.  However. the Garmin comes with its own charger so this is not necessary.  I thought about returning this item but the wording in the return policy was caustic and not at all returnfriendly.  Because the price was very good and because I didnt want to go through the return process with this company. I kept it.,3,0,385
A1HZWHI3JLGZ5N,56,I bought this unit as a gift for the grandchildren to read books. My plan was test it out and buy 3 if it worked. I planned to buy gift cards for the unit so the kids could buy books. Barnes and Noble requires a credit card to activate this unit! That is a show stopper as it is not desirable for young children to have a unit with credit card information linked to it. They could lose the unit etc. I loaded my credit card information to test the unit. After deciding to return the unit I talked to customer service about deleting my account information. The answer from 3 people was you can not delete your account information. I can not recommend this company.,1,0,663
A1I0MH28TROVUJ,2228,DO NOT BUY!  BUYER BEWARE!We have had two Nooks.  First one lasted 8 months before the outer case cracked. It was constantly buggy. books wont open and have to be sideloaded. and it is sloooooooww!  If you are used to the quick response of an iphone or ipad or ipod. you will be sorely disappointed with the response of the Nook.Now 5 months into replacement Nook and eink failure.  No more warranty. no more Nook.,1,0,414
A1I1118P9ICS7D,1,I got my video head cleaner. and immediately put it into my VCR.  It didnt clean the heads at all. because my VCR ate it!!  Not sure if that is my VCR. or if the head cleaner was defective in the first place... ..  I will order this product again. one more time. and if it gets eaten again. I have to assume there is a bigger issue with my VCR than just needing the heads cleaned... ..,1,0,385

A1I3ETYWWMUWWC,1717,I spent a great deal of time looking for a case for my IIIxe. Because of the price I decided to try this one. I am not in the slightest disappointed. The IIIxe fits perfectly WITH the flip cover in place. and comes out of the case easily. but will not fall out. .From other comments. I suspect this case may have been recently improved. If so I have the newer one..The hook on the belt clip keeps the case in place. but allows it to be moved fore and aft as you sit or bend. It will not come off a belt by accident.I frequently forget Im wearing it  and thats the highest compliment.,5,1,583
A1I3SLDFZASGOU,0,Purchased 2 of these. they work great.  Much cheaper than HDMI cables in electronics store.  Shipping was a little slow. but highly recommended overall.,4,1,152
A1I3TXWH5C9JZP,0,Arrived sooner than expected! It seems better than the cable that came with my Nexus. I am considerring buying another one just in case my flimsy cable breaks.,5,0,159
A1I4234PN932QU,16,I bought the Nook color expecting it to function as advertised. such as provide web surfing.  WRONG! Web pages take a minimum of 25 minutes to appear and that is with me sitting 2 ft from my router! Bookmarking a page is useless because it isnt saved as a favorite page.  It is only saved as a page last viewed meaning if you book marked CNN. youll be reading the same news story three days later. The Nook color wont let me view Yahoo email. save a bookmark for Disney World. or remember my login for Facebook.  Web browsing gets an F for frustratingly useless. Buy the Nook ONLY if you want to use it as a color ereader and nothing more.  I wish I would have invested my USD200 in an iPad.,2,0,691
A1I43BAZ2MDJB1,0,Good price as an addon purchase .only 3 allowed.. but Home Plug device has 4 ports I would like to have bought one more at teh discounted price. Amazon.,4,1,152
A1I4KWU1K4Q415,1616,A friend of mine had it sitting on his desk with a wirelessInternet card in the PCMCIA slot. The small size. SUPER bright COLORscreen and nice keyboard had me in the store within an hour!  Its VERY functional .and  I have a pretty small laptop..  Its great in meetings. Navigating through  CE is fast and intuitive. The keyboard has a solid feel and its packed  with Windows like productivity software.  Ive only had lowend Sharp  units. so for me the 680 is fabulous!  I sync with Outlook 2000. get on the  Net. sendreceive faxes and keep myself busy while my son is  u0026quotwhoopNitupu0026quot at Chucky Cheeseu0026quot.  Its not small but I  usually carry my shoulder bag during business. The color is kind of wild  .purple. but its an OK tradeoff for all this unit can do.,5,1,778
A1I68HGX9VG1PY,1617,Had one since Christmas 2010 and already owned a regular Nook. so I am familiar with the differences between the displays.  The NC is a fabulous. if a bit heavy. device that is a great ebook reader as well as video player out of the box.  Root the thing and it becomes an android tablet. giving you access to a lot of functionality.I have no issues with reading on the NC.  Adjusting the brightness and contrast is easy enough and Ive read for hours with no eye strain.  Im more than satisfied with it because unlike the Kindle. I can read almost anything .and rooted even Kindle books using the android Kindle app..  Works with library lending. free ebook sites and the Calibre tool helps expand what you can read even more.Hands down. its the best device out there at the price.,5,1,780
A1I7NI2FFVJLVX,17,The color nook looks all bright and flashy but it is really a wanna be ipad.  While I enjoyed the LCD screen and the lack of need for reading light. this same feature makes the reading life of this product only 68 hours instead of 68 days as the the black and white one.  You have to decide if you are really using it to read. or the other shiny features.,4,1,355
A1I8J3INEANFVY,3737,We needed to connect the Xbox 360 in the living room to the modem in a far away study in order to play XBOX Live. When we looked at other stores they often didnt have one long enough. and when they did they were pricey! When I came and looked at amazon.com. I couldnt believe my eyes! The price on this cable is miniscule compared to those in stores and it works exactly the same. We have had no problems with it and are happy with the purchase.,5,1,445
A1I9230AEAZNUC,0,but i have a hard time sometimes with this thing.it works off and on and its annoying... but it still works!,4,1,108
A1I9P5QHGOSL3S,0,Bought this extension unit primarily for a Directv DVR box in an upstairs room. When originally installing I connected a phone to test it and there was a slight humbuzz on the line. so Im not sure how great it would be for actual phone use. The adapter is largebulky. you would think that with todays technology they could make these things smaller.,4,1,349
A1IAN0989ELXF3,22,This CB is terrific.  I purchased it for use on my Honda Goldwing.  The Honda CB is over USD600.00.  I purchased this CB for about a tenth of that price.  I use the CB to communicate with other riders in my club.  After tuning the stock Honda CB antenna to the cb I received favorable comments from my fellow riders as to the clarity and power of the CB.  I would highly recommend this.  Note. in order to transmit and receive on the Goldwing. I seperately purchased a helmet comm set.,5,1,485
A1IBSO769EXNU5,1112,i love the fake coskin leather on this thing. it feels and looks great. my only complaint is that sometimes the cds lok as though they want to slide out from the sleeves. but that isnt too much of a problem. Also. it doesnt  fit in my glovebox anymore .I used to have two 24cd wallets that fit in  there fine. so i gotta throw it in the back now. No real problems though.  good case overall.,4,1,391
A1ICP97UKOY9ZW,33,I have had .the wheelless version of. this trackball for what seems like forever. Its outlasted two computers. three moves. and must have been with me over 5 years at this point. .It was the brandnew. cuttingedge model when I got it!.It fits *so* comfortably in the hand. especially for someone with long fingers like me. .Putting my fingers on a topball model means my thumb is too short to reach the buttons!.Its simple to clean. has never given me a moments grief. and is still going strong today. Considering its been disconnected .*why?!?!?.. Im thinking about getting another now just as protection against the day it finally dies. I dont want to ever use anything else!,5,1,676
A1ICQD8HCHJJHN,33,I own an L50 for two years right now. A sharp and clear image. plus great conveniance because it size. Beautiful sound with good earphones. I never had even a slight malfunction. You have all the controls you need. The device is hardly constructed. so you can take it with you anywhere without problems. I use it in my bed. at the office. in hotels rooms .great when plugged on the rooms TV. etc... Not the larger image on the market. but surely one of the most precise. Dont even try to search for the pixels. I just say you can buy it without fear.,5,1,550
A1ICX7J37HMH1M,1819,I received this product last week and used it without the external microphone.  I heard more of the u0026quotmachine noiseu0026quot than the conversation .during playback..  I had the settings set specifically for my  use. and the noise it made on playback was annoying.,2,0,270
A1IDG1V2YU2ASX,6969,I was very concerned in buying a DVD player as I had heard so many problems that DVD players could have. Such as Lip Sync. artifact. fludder. poor transitions on dual layer discs etc... This had me scared to death of  which one to get. The Pioneer 414 was great at everything except it had a  Lip Sync problem. The Panasonic A120 was a great player except it had some  dual layer disc problems. But I wasnt able to read one bad thing about the  Sony so that is what I bought and I love it. Not one single complaint and  trust me I have watched all 94 movies that I own on it with not one  problem.  It just plays great. The remote is easy to use. the picture is  great. the sound is great. Buy IT!!!!,5,1,700

A1IK1ZTDHJS6WW,0,This nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view.  The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.  My former Simple Touch only needed charging once a month  with the wifi ON  all the time.  I would NOT recommend this product.,3,0,289
A1IK4M0AX1WMGE,22,Ive bought 4 of these. and they work pretty well. but theyre a little offsized and dont fit into everything. Im using these in 2 Ibanez SRX705 active basses. and in my Cordoba classicalflamenco guitar. but it wouldnt fit into the slot for my Ibanez acoustic bass  it got stuck and I had to work it back out.  They work fine and seem to last a good while. and I like that you can recharge them.  Just be aware of whether you have enough room for it  if its a pretty tight fit. this may not work.I havent ever found these in any store. only the AA u0026 AAA batteries. and Energizer makes a cool charger that charges all 3 sizes  this is the one I bought and it works well. .....,4,1,677
A1IKC2YBHXIE1M,0,I use it on Microsoft Lynch for telecoms.  The speaker is a little  tinny  but the mic works well without echoing.,4,1,114
A1IKCSS32AJGKS,5657,I have a set of these 2 way radios and they are excellant. My wife and I use these when we go to the mall.or when we go on a trip with another couple using 2 cars. My dad and I also use these on our 120 acre  farm.When driving in cars reception is good up to a mile.When using  outside around hills reception range seems to be around .7 to a  mile.When using outside in ideal conditions .flat land. a way from power  lines. reception seems to be around 1.8 to 2.2 miles.This unit is small  and fits in the palm of your hand. These units uses AA batteries which  lasts up to 30 hours.,5,1,583
A1ILWPH1GHUXE2,44,I have had this camcorder for 4 years and I am still happy with the purchase.For myself being a big guy. I was never comfortable with the tiny MiniDV camcorders out there. and the size of the Digital8 camcorders is a nice fit in my hands. without being too large and heavy for my wife to use comfortably.I have not had much chance to do comparison testing. but the picture quality is very good.  In some cases I might think the color is a bit undersaturated. but I prefer this to seeing colors pushed beyond what they should be.  I have no complaints about the sharpness of the video.  In very low light the picture doers become grainy I suspect that new camcorders out there may do a better job in low light than the TRV310.One thing I really like about this camcorder today is that it seems better built than the Digital8 models than Sony is currently producing.  In addition. the lens is a bit larger on the early Digital8 models. so low light performance may actually be better than the current ones .but I have not done a comparison..  I also will recommend the TRV130 for video editing I have had no problems loading video off of the camcorder onto my Windows XP PC with a firewire cable.My complaints on the camcorder.1. Still uses tape. which can jam up inside the camcorder .luckily I havent lost a tape yet..  Ive also been told specifically to use *only* Sony Hi8  Digital8 tapes with this unit.2. There is a manual exposure setting. which is good for shooting candlelit scenes. etc.  But the camera is missing a manual white balance that I wish it had.  The white balance is done automatically when the camera is turned on when indoors with natural light I will point the lens to a blue object at powerup to eliminate a bluish tint to the picture likewise if the indoor scene is lit I will point at a warmtoned object to eliminate everything looking orange.3. The supplied Infolithium battery is useless.  I which Sony would include one of the larger batteries as standard.4. As mentioned above. low light performance could be better.  The low light settings the camera provides are rarely used.Altogether. Im very happy with this camcorder.,4,1,2153
A1IMCM3OSZFPQK,34,After looking at a couple of negative reviews. I thought I would take a chance on this wall mount and Im glad I did. This mount was very sturdy and is one the heaviest mount Ive. .which. in my opinion. vouches for it strength. I mounted a 2012 51 inch Samsung plasma TV and . after two weeks. the mount still holds. I have used it for hours extended in multiple positions  it still holds.,5,1,388
A1INB4IG89RSLD,1617,I get my 722 for Christmas and it has been a great product in the few weeks that Ive had it.  The sound is always clear. the bass does not drown out the treble as is the case with some Sony models.  This model does not  have the UTOC error exhibited by the 702 and by some other earlier models.  Moreover. recording is very easy.  I dont have a digital output device  available. so I use analog recording.  I can take a line direct from the  sound card of my PC to record my mp3 collection on MiniDisc.  This  convenience is heightened by the fact that this unet will not skip under  most normal circumstances.  I find that for use in the car or while  jogging. it will not skip.  The sound is perfectly clear .much better than  the Sony. Panasonic. or Aiwa models I tested at Circuit City..  I highly  recommend the MDMS722.  Its sound quality leads the field. it almost never  skips. and. personally. I like the appearance as well.  However. it is not  the smallest on the market.  If size is your only requirement. dont buy  this unit.,5,1,1038
A1INB57G85J2W7,22,My previous comments still apply even though the hardware and software I use has changed completely.  PowerMac G5 and OS X Tiger.,5,0,129
A1INSPL5DFK06C,2828,Usage. .5 stars. I keep coming up for new uses for these radios. I have taken them to conventions. paintball trips. ATVing in Glamis. driving. Big Bear. L.B. Grand Prix. swap meets. The SLK is VERY compact and easy to keep  on you.Range. .4 Stars. Impressive to say the least. in Las Vegas I was  on the 12th floor of the Stardust and I was able to stay in *clear* contact  w my coworker in the Las Vegas Convention Center.  Now thats range for a  2way under USD100!Durability. .5 stars. I have dropped them a bunch of  times and they dont break.  Antenna is thick and rubber. the battery case  is a large onepiece molding. so it doesnt crack easily at all.Features. .5 stars. They have almost perfected the SLK. it has a very  handy page button.  It rings like a cell phone to tell you someone is  trying to get a hold of you.  Also. it has the channel lock to prevent  accidental channel changes.Only one bad thing about these radios.... you  need to buy more than one to have fun! ..,5,1,986
A1IOPBNR8P7I6P,0,I have not used it yet.but it fits the port on my computer. so Im happy...so far so good !,1,0,90
A1IOTPWSJVTMV6,55,Ive broken 2 screens on my Palm III and I think Ive finally found the answer in the Incase Palm Top Case. The covering really protects while not looking like something that would survive a nuclear attack. The blue color  is great. I believe that torque is the issue with me when it comes to my  broken screens. This case offers much more protection than my fancy  expensive leather wallet type case. It could use a bit more storage space  for cards and such. Overall. Im very pleased and would highly recommend  this item.,5,1,522
A1IPNOCZKI3GIF,11,My wife had been blaring our stereo in the morning throughout the house so I thought it was time to invest in something that might keep me from going deaf in the next couple of years.  After looking around. I opted for this.This stereo is great and has very nice sound for a shower radio.  Nobodys going to mistake it for a Bang and Olefson. but it does exactly what it was meant to do.  The radio stations come in nice and clear even without the extendable antenna. even the AM stations.  And I love that its digital.I havent really used the TV band as theres only one station in my area that is in the 2  13 channel range. but from the little I have done. it works as expected.The weather band is a nice substitute for the morning news weather and works great.One of its best features is that it runs on 3 C batteries.  No cord to plug in .which wouldnt be good for a shower radio anyway . ..  I havent run out of batteries yet. but its still early.  It stashes out of the way nicely and has a fairly slim form factor.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for some entertainment while getting ready in the morning.,4,1,1130
A1IPSD65LKBKWU,0,This cable only charges the phone. no data connectivity. Tried with a number of different software packages.  Dont waste your time unless all you need is charging capabilities.,1,0,176
A1IQJSHCMW69O5,0,I bought this item because of the description that is for the Blackberry bold. to my surprise is for the curve it doesnt fit the screen there is like one inch of screen not protected by the screen. also it reflects sunlight making the screen virtually unusable when outdoors. and looks ugly..,1,0,292
A1IR3KG8LNX84P,25,The headset works just like I expected it to. The foam earpiece can be a little uncomfortable after a long time wearing it. but this is true of almost any headphones or earpiece. Volume is great for louder environments and it works with the Motorola radio VOX as expected. when you read the instructions.Could be a bit more comfortable. but it works like I expected.,4,1,366
A1IRPLB2K75XHF,45,I bought my Midland 75822 for its 40 channels at AM but hoped that it culd be mod to FM and 120 channels as said in some reviwes. Actually. I would prefer AMFM CB walkie with 40 legal channels but they are second to nonexiting. .Why ?. BEWARE as of rouhgly New Year 2011 MOD to this gadget is not known anymore. Midland has CHANGED the PCB without changing the model number. so you will not be able to MOD it anymore according to recipees on the net. and it is not clear that it will be ever possible  perhaps they have somply removed the extra functionality from the chip andor closed all loopholes permitting inadverted MODs.As for the gadget itself. it is not extremly well done  Id say even sloppy and the manual brashly not giving enough info to the user. For example. draw of current from batteries at CB reception is incredibly high. 63mA and at wether channel even more .with volume set to minimum.. Given the current state of the art of chips I would say it is virtualy imposible to arrive to such a high power consumption. The sound quality could be better especially at low signal intensities where a kind of autosquelch cut of the RF signal producing audible distortions in the demodulated audio. The adio amplifier is irritatingly noisy even at lowest level setting and under squelch. Also annoying is the fact that if you plug normal stereo headphones you will hear tone only in left earphone whereas the right is muted. The audiuo output to the earphone is the same as of the loudspeaker meaning too noisy at normal listening level and too loud .you must keep the volume knob at very low setting if you do not want your eardrum as well as the earphone membrane blown away.. The external microphone jack is unexplained in the manual. it serves at the same time as input and PushToTalk control .PT.  once you plug in the micophone jack your PT button is dead. Manual is mute on whether 75822 supports condenser mic whichy requires power supply or dynamic mic or both .or none ?  I did not try any..All in all. good value for the price. standard quality but not CBphilic one. However. I do not know of better CB walkie on the market. My recommendation. if you need something like this. buy it.,4,1,2205
A1IRQFA24299PM,0,I ordered this mini microphone for my iPod Touch.  It will allow me to record voice memos.  The price was great.  However. the first one I ordered did not work.  I emailed the company and they sent me a replacement right away.  I would rank this product as average. but the company was great.  They stood by their product and sent a replacement without hassle.  I would definitely buy from SF Planet again.,4,1,406
A1IRW11LQRH0GP,11,Im writing this product review almost a year after I ordered and received 3 .new. Maxell VP100 Dry Video Head Cleaning tapes. Ive kept my vhs heads clean by using just one of these. since May of 2013 until now .March 1. 2014.. The Maxell head cleaning tape Ive been using is the only one of the three .new tapes. that has the oldoriginal package design of the VP100 tape  and it has worked fine. The other two tapes have a new package design  and neither of these tapes work AT ALL in fact. each of these tapes would actually jamb my vhs tape player to where it would turn itself off. I fiddled with both of these tapes for several minutes. trying to get them to advance. by advancing the tape by hand and attempting to play with fast forward. and also rewinding  but NO GO!!!! These tapes WILL NOT WORK. AT ALL!!  The b*tch of it is that. since I got the order 910 months ago. I cant return the faulty tapes for credit or replacement.  So I have to bite the big one on these two tapes purchased from Amazon fulfillment. .And while Im not certain  because I no longer have the packing slips from the shipment  it seems that the one good. working tape .with the old package design. came from an independent seller on Amazon marketplace. while the two faulty ones came directly from Amazon fulfillment. .So. BEWARE if you order any of these new Maxell VP100 model headcleaning tapes. They could be faulty.And just for the record. Ive used Maxell VP100 Dry headcleaning tapes for more than ten years prior to this order. and been pleased with the results .Id give it 4 stars overall they quit being effective quite a lot earlier than the 100 cleanings touted by their marketing. but overall they did a pretty good job..  But these new ones suck .well. its actually more like that they give my vhs player a fatal wedgie..,1,0,1817
A1IT5WVQUX3AOF,23,Based on the price and a need for RF  capability. I thought Id give this unit a try. It works well with my Quasar TV. Technics CD. JVC VCR. and Jerrold Cable box. It glitched on the Sony DE835 receiver. not being able  to switch back to TV mode after switching out. Also. the surroundmenu  features wont respond. A call to the hotline informed me that this Sony  model is not covered  so. as someone previously mentioned. its best to  call before purchasing if this is important. Actually Id blame Sony more  than Jensen as they could try for more backwardcompatibility when bringing  new units to market. Anyway. I wanted to control my tuner and cd player  from my outdoor spa and this unit allows me to do that. But I have a direct  line of sight to the RF receiver thru a window and I think if it wasnt for  this. it wouldnt work as well. or at all. Generally. the RF is limited.  All in all. for USD30. Im satisfied.,4,1,920
A1IWOWRNG3K7JZ,1415,The TEAC arrived today... I have been playing with it all evening.  Here are a few highlights.First off. the machine is built like a tank!  This thing is built to last and it has the heft of a pro machine.The CD section is amazingly good.  This is one of the best CD players I have ever heard.  Now. thats saying something because I have used pro Sony and Denon machines in radio stations that cost several thousand dollars.  My current Sony changer is a great sounding machine but this TEAC has something extra going on that I cant quite put my finger on.  According to the manuals spec page. this is a 4 times oversampling machine with an analog filter.  In comparison. my Sony is eight times over with all digital filtering.  The TEACs laser is a powerful tribeam type not seen since the early days of CDs.  This is very oldschool design and I can only come to the conclusion that TEAC did this on purpose.  There is no cost savings using 4 x and an analog filter.  As a matter of fact. this is more expensive because were talking about some very delicate discrete circuitry in that filter...  Im gong to be listening to a lot of CDs in the next few weeks.The cassette section was a bit of a surprise because it was in perfect alignment right out of the box.  The last time that happened to me was when I bought an Onkyo machine back in 1990.  I dont have an alignment tape but I have several tapes I know for sure are prefect.  I grabbed some of them. put the output in mono. with screw driver in hand. ready to tweak the heads and they did not need anything done to them at all.  They are perfect and the technician sealed off the azimuth and height screws with some dope so it is not going to change anytime soon.  I put the screw driver back and that was that.  The speed is dead on and the wow and flutter is extremely low.The noise levels are phenomenally low on this machine. as well.  With the Dolby B on. you have a hard time hearing any hiss at all.  The specs say that the noise is down around 57 dB with it turned off and you get near 70 dB with it on.... Thats with normal tape!  The stats only get better with chrome or metal.  That is about the same performance you get from a broadcast cart machine or a high end quarter track tape recorder at 7u002612 ips.  Very impressive.The door is very robustly built with a magnifying window that actually enlarges the window in the tape so you can look at a glance and see how much tape has gone by.  The tape itself sits very deep in the machine.  The transport controls have a solid feel and the solenoids must be huge because when you work them they give out with a loud kerchunk!As I suspected. the Dolby does sound better because its only B circuitry and nothing else.  There is no bias adjustment on this machine at all. either manual or automatic.  However. the record play response was great.  I tried laying some audio on a couple of different brands of tape and there was not much difference in the sound from one to another.  TEAC is doing something unusual with the bias on these machines.  It must be a very high frequency bias circuit because the noise is so low.  Cassette bias is usually somewhere around 40 kHz but Sony put out some decks a few years ago with bias up around 150 kHz.  This machine performs like those decks so I think TEAC has gone that way too.  You can really slam the levels and get very little distortion on playback.A couple of down points.... The automatic CD dubbing is at a fixed record level and a really loud CD will overload the tape.  No biggie.  I like doing it manually anyhow.  The CD player does not have a peak search function on it.  My Sony does so I can dub off of that one when I do level critical stuff.  There are several functions you cannot access from the front panel and you have to use the remote control to get to them.  The only one Ill miss is the time function that allows you to show remaining times on track and the whole CD while it is playing.  You have to do that from the remote.All in all. this is a fabulous. high end. old school piece of audio gear.,5,1,4084
A1IWYXF1XNU6G9,0,I use my travel charger quite often. It is great to not have to carry around the full cradle just to charge the battery in my Palm Vx while Im away from home and office. The extra sync cable is rarely useful for me. as I feel awkward syncing to someone elses machine but it has been handy for installing a needed program update or grabbing a new game while on the road.The only quibble I have is that the kit has a lot of bits to keep track of. A more elegant design would have one cable that connects to the Palm device with the other end capable of plugging into the charger or a sync connector. depending on your needs. That would perhaps enable the charger to have all the various international adapters in one unit instead of loose. Still. it is a valuable accessory and has been worth the cost for me.,4,1,807
A1IXR2XJ0UOFDJ,0,case is ok but could be better my other case has a magnet to hold it closed and open. this one you have to hold and it is kinda hard to get used to.,3,0,148
A1IYWDEO3EDMTM,1,like the one wire instead of two  like that the speaker parts rotate to fit your head  i use it to play static while i sleep  keeps out all the street noise,4,1,156
A1J0DFA2WG0VQ,2,i received a class 10. not a class 6 card.  it seems to work just fine. but the class 10 could be had elsewhere for less USDUSD.,3,0,128
A1J243FOZ28YE1,0,I didnt order my Nook from Amazon but all I can say is. that it is AMAZING! This nook is for the people who are major readers like me. I mean I can rip through 3  5 books depending on the length. You have to think that I dont always buy the books. I check them out with my librarys Overdrive. Its wonderful .though you have to download Adobe Digital Editions. which is completely safe. to manage your library books with you Nook..The down side is that it is not backlit. I like to read all day. and it kind of sucks that Im not able to read in the dark without any additional accessories. The battery life is great. I charged it on Christmas night. and the charge is still over 85%.They could have made the power button a little easier to push because I have trouble telling if i have pushed it or not. If your not the biggest reader. and you like to play gives. I recommend getting the Nook Tablet or Kindle Fire. NOT THE NOOK COLOR! The nook color is supposed to be terrible at everything.I have no problems with my nook. I love it. and I am happy with it.,4,1,1058
A1J2E7CBMOLNKX,11,This works great and saved me USDUSDUSDUSD that a newer vehicle would have cost.  Plug it in and listen to whatever youve got on your phone or access stations through your phone.  Its fun to listen to foreign stations. etc.,4,1,223
A1J2TBEWQ7YBJO,88,Throught the course of 8 months I have gone through FOUR of these because the dongle that connects the CAT5 cable to the actual card always breaks where it connects to the card.  If your laptop is sitting in one place all the time. it will probably be fine. but if you plan on having your laptop move around while you are connected. then forget it.  The only reason I stayed with this model was because Staples would replace it for free each time it broke. since it was usually 2 months apart.  Other than that. the card itself worked superbly.  Fast clean connection when the dongle was intact.,2,0,595
A1J2YWLIFWXU8X,0,I have a pair of MH230R. and bought this to work with them. I havent tested them outdoors yet. but they seem to be pretty solidly built and have good volume indoors. I intend to use them for skiing. and will report back with any observations. after I have had a chance to use them on the slopes. One thing I did notice is that the cord is not super long. and its pretty well coiled. I think it will be able to stretch from my pocket to my lapel. but its pretty borderline on length. at least with the coil.One thing to note is that. due to sparse information on the Amazon product page. I wasnt 100% sure it would work with my model. The main reason Im writing this review is to post that it DOES work with the MH230R. and that the full compatibility list is here......Lastly. I doubt this will be a problem for most buyers. but note that its USD20 for ONE microphone. Considering I bought the pair of walkietalkies themselves for around USD25. that seems pretty expensive. I wish there were a set that had a pair of walkie talkies and a pair of microphones.,3,0,1058
A1J3FVBU81WDUP,14,I am very glad i got this Mp3 player. it is the best. Firstly. i think the  music quality is great. When you read adds and stuff they always say near  cdquality but I think its better. Also. you can store a lot of things on  it. Depending on how big the songs are. you store from 9 to 15 .or thats  what i can get.. Also ive dropped it way too many times but. its fine. It  just wont break. Lastly. it looks cool too. Even IF it was bad. what it  looks like makes want to buy it. I deffinitly recomend you get it. its a  bit pricy but deffinitly worth it.,5,1,555
A1J3ID8E1NZREF,0,The monitor arrived fine. and was well packed.The only problem is a hissing sound and slight flicker on bright images.Now I know why those panels fail testing to be used in the expensive Dell and Apple monitors...EDIT. Reducing brightness in the gpu driver color settings reduces the hissing and flickering.Still 3 stars though. you get what you pay for.,3,0,354
A1J3VOZK3GR7MW,0,Didnt work. I purchased it to hopefully stop my car CD player from skipping. I followed the very simple instructions  but CDs still skip. Very disappointed. Dont waste your time or money on this one.,1,0,199
A1J4HESN7P3FV2,67,For the price they sound great but the construction could be stronger.  They are hot around 600m1k but otherwise they are rated from 2020.000mhz and seem to do an accurate job of representing those frequencies.  They  also come with a pair of earbuds. overall good product at a good price.,4,1,289
A1J4M3SAR9XAM6,25,I am not a photographer. but I bought this camera to see if I could be a good enough shooter to do a coffeetable full color book of photos of business coaches.  Bottom line.  The images. the color. the clarity. the  simplicity .yet with lots of manual options. has made the book project a  reality.  Ill probably buy the upcoming .oct 99 they tell me. Nikon D1  because it has 2.7mil pixels. but I dont have to  the Nikon Coolpix 950  is that good.,5,1,448
A1J4WYA78PS76Q,22,Very durable holds stylus in place and I dont have to worry about my kindle falling its fits snug and is well secured.,5,0,118
A1J5917H6VZWUF,46,I bought two Sony 120 Minute Hi8 casettes for my sharp camcorder. I used it over the long weekend.The recording was just phenomenal. On playback.it  seems as if all the events happen again. It is a must buy.,5,1,207
A1J5CC19MR4H9,0,I bought this A drive to transfer over pictures and word documents from a bunch of old floppy disks I had lying around.  Plugged the drive into my computer and all seemed fine at first.  Out of a stack of about 20 floppies. the first 4 or 5 had pictures. etc on them that I transferred OK.  Then I started getting disks that were showing that they were blank.  I expected this as I wasnt sure what was on them. if anything.  Well. I started to wonder after the next dozen disks were showing as blank.  So. just to check. I popped in the disks that I knew had data on them.  Lo and behold. they were now showing as blank.  I then disconnected the A drive from my computer and reconnected it.  It started up fine and read correctly one of the disks that I already knew had data.  I popped in another that I already knew had data but it showed as blank.  So. I tried the disconnect thing again and got data from another disk but nothing on another that should have showed something.So. overall. I certainly wouldnt recommend this drive.,2,0,1033
A1J5LI9FUHQNRO,0,The product compatibilty is difficult to determine with existing Wireless Phone Jacks. I thought I read all the specs before I ordered it and I was still unable to use it. Buy at your own risk.,2,0,193
A1J65RUXMBHW9Q,33,I can not say enough great things about this case.  I love how it props the book up to read. its the perfect size to put a few necessities in the case along with your eReader. and it looks great.  It allows you to charge your eReader while in the case. or attach headphones.  And it comes with and itty bitty Moleskine notebook.  Love.,5,1,335
A1J6KN07O81UMV,0,I have 3 Nooks. An 8gb for my wife. 16gb for my 5 year old and an HD+ 9  for me. I have had major problems with all three. If you are just reading books the 8gb will be fine. If you want to download lots of google play games you will fill up an 8gb fast! It will also crash on you if the tablet just doesnt like a game. The sd card is a joke! The only thing you can put on there is movies and it takes hours and a computer connection to put them on the sd card. However. I love the graphics and ease of use of my 32gb hd+. Bottom line. if its for kids who like lots of games choose another tablet!,2,0,597
A1J6R7S88MU3U3,0,I made this purchase for the sole and specific purpose of charging the Kindle Fire.  They wont perform this function..,1,0,118
A1J7LLUJV5KV02,910,I bought 2 of these along with the Cobra FRS radios so that my wife and I could drive our own cars across country and still communicate.  The radios worked fine. but the headsets were an absolute waste of money.  First off. the batterys wouldnt seat properly. so sometimes they worked. but sometimes they didnt.  Then there was the trouble with getting the vox and volume settings set properly that others have complained about.  Plus. the mikes wont stay where you put them.  So we threw them in the back seats. and used our radios as handhelds all the way from San Diego to North Carolina.,1,0,591
A1J87C2DKBO441,2628,If you want solid. well constructed cable that you are never going to have to think about again then Belkin is for you.  Ive never had one problem.,5,0,147
A1J87C2DKBO441,1414,I dont know about the rest of you but I have been researching products to allow me to play music for about 2 months and Ive had a hard time making a decision.  Ive looked a mp3. minidisc. and regular cd players.  I finally chose to jump in and buy this mainly because I didnt want the mp3 craze to pass me by .^..  Heres what I think.Styling.  Look good.  It is almost exactly the size of a cigarette box but the depth is about 34 less.  The clippable pouch that comes with it is okay but you need to undo the velcro tie to turn it on and completely pull it out to vary the volume.  The pouch is quite cushionany and probably saved me when I dropped it.  It does feel and look durable.  The blue backlit screen looks attractive.  The mp3 file names scroll across the screen rather slowly but. again. a minor point.Sound.  Apart from the miserable headphones .my main problem was static as the headphone jack swiveled around the entry socket. the sound is good to great.  I wasnt looking for u0026quotknock your socks offu0026quot sound anyway but I am quite happy with it.  The highest volume setting is not as loud as Id like it but it doesnt bother me to any great extent.Loading music.  Loading is quick thru the USB port.  I use  RealJukebox Plus .the one that costs money. along with an addon to manage music loading and I am very happy with it.  I didnt like the Rio Audio Manager but it works fine.  Setup was a piece of cake.  Very intuitive and fast.Memory.  64MB allows me to place almost any CD I have in memory.  I have a mixture of 128KBS and 192KBS sampling rates on my mp3s and at 192 a single CD is about all that fits on there.  The expansion port for memory upgrades will come in handy.Overall.  Nothing really to complain about.  A nice little gadget that Im very happy with.,4,1,1794
A1J8WLRMT6D9K5,77,Yup they worked really well for what I wanted them for. in my kitchen. I was happy for about a month. Then one speaker myseriously died. Contacting the maker did nothing. They would not support at all. I gave up. Now I still use the one speaker. because I havent found a reliable and good sounding pair to replace them with. How is it that no body seems interested in making a speaker set that would just work nicely off of the computer wireless network? WOuldnt that be the simple and useful solution for millions of us who no longer need or even own traditional stereos?,1,0,572
A1J9BGO7U1ZAY6,1011,The Kodak DC240 is the first digital camera that I have bought  needless to say. I was a bit nervous about this purchase. There are so many DCs out there. making the decision even harder. I bought the camera and 5 minutes  after putting the batteries in the camera. I was using it to take pictures  of my kids. the dog. my wife. the wall. the trees and basically anything  that was within my immediate view was not safe from my picture taking. The  camera is so easy to use and has such a wonderful picture resolution that I  would like to dub the camera The Kodak DC240  as being u0026quotstupid  proofu0026quot. Anyone can use it and the picture quality that it offers is  remarkable. I highy recommend the camera.,4,1,716
A1J9LVA298D5OF,0,Bought the 7 ft gray cable. Good price. works as advertised. The snagless feature is good to have since I have broken the plastic latch on other cables in the past. Highly recommend.,5,0,182
A1JAF3WUROGZ0G,4767,Before I start. i just want to say to all those sony lovers. dont buy the sony dvd player.  Its the most expensive and is not even a decent dvd player. youll be just throwing your paychecks away so forget sony!  Now  the Panasonic A120. great price everywhere and amazing player.  Panasonic  being the number one company on the market today has shown why they are one  with the A120.  Great picture and you get Dolby Digital 5.1 surround with  DTS.  This player has it all another thing I love is it plays DVDCDVCD.  What else can a person ask for.  Its the best no matter what.  So if your  looking for DVD player look no more. im an expert and you should get this.  GREAT PRICE. SUPERIOR PLAYER. AMAZING PICTURE. MIND BLOWING SOUND!,5,1,734
A1JAFIR5YCE5VD,12,I dont know how effective it is if you use it the way they tell you to use it. BUT I dont use the pads that come with it. I use one of those yellow Simoniz .Billy Maze. FIX IT paint polishers that can be bought on amazon. I put a drop on the disc and start buffing away. I let the liquid get really thin to where its almost completely dry and then I clean the disc.granted it doesnt make it perfect .though who knows if you work on it for an hour. but I just fixed one of my sons Tony Hawk games that was unplayable,4,1,515

A1JB0SYY10KNOJ,1,It is easy and comfortable to wear. not sure if it was just my product or so is made in general. but the cleaner disc is not fully adjusted to where the optical pickup lens is located .by just two millimeters.. and I can not taste good if it fulfills its job well.,3,0,264

A1JBRL6CD1SPOJ,212,When evaluating this product for yourself. I suppose the most obvious question to consider is. do I want a beltclipping case for my Palm Pilot?  If youre me. you dont.  Lets face it. there are enough unfounded stigmas  about Palm Pilot users out there without us purchasing belt clip u0026quotpalm  pilot holstersu0026quot to perpetuate them!  I. for one. refuse to attach my  Palm Pilot to my belt. and I hope you will join me.  Consider a sleeker.  more pocketable case.,3,0,472
A1JD47C64TAHTU,0,I have used Maxell vcr head cleaners in the past that have something on the screen to let you know what is happening. This tape is about 10 seconds long. its nearly impossible to tell when it begins and ends so its very difficult to use. But the biggest problem is that it doesnt clean or help the performance of the vcr!,1,0,321
A1JD4BUHK1ZPJL,1,I bought Sony camcorder last year. It has stopped recording video. I cant see anything in the viewfinder or screen. Absolutely nothing.On the flip side. it did work nicely for the year when it was working though.Just in case. you think I am disgruntled. cynical and I am writing this out of spite. please follow this link. There are many like us......In fact. people there have filed a class action suit against Sony on this issue.Overall. buy it if you want to. But see you on the forum above in 1 year.,1,0,504

A1JETHCL85UIBW,0,These RCA wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances.  Dont bother trying to use them for data such as with TiVo or a computer.  They simply wont work.  They use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the house.,2,0,315
A1JF07MP4W4BWT,22,When I bought my Palm V many models ago. I needed a light. spacefriendly charger to take with me whenever I went home for break during school. The included charger was too bulky and fragile. so I decided that I should purchase a travel charger. So far. it has worked well. The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I have not used the other features. The only thing that I have used is the charger itself. I have yet to use the portable HotSync cradle or the voltage converters. For what I use it for. the price is a little high. Perhaps when I travel overseas and purchase a laptop in the future. it will come in handy. But hey. I love the suitcasefriendly size!,4,1,680
A1JF3C6SN5GILI,34,The headphones have too much static for use in my home. I ended up buying a set of wired headphones .Sennheiser eH2200. which work great.

A1JG343H3MZJK9,44,I love my Advent Wireless stereo headphones.  I have 3 and have used them for several years.  The only complaint is that the ear pads have worn out and I cannot find new ones.  I was able to before the company was bought out.  The only reception problem I ever have is when I leave one particular cordless phone off the base.  I get a periodic beeping.  Return the phone to the base and the beeping stops.  I have a studio separate from my house.  I can listen clearly in the studio from a tv playing next door.  Buy one today!,4,1,527
A1JGYEKQHHPP2X,12,On a PC or Mac. this doesnt open. The Quick Start guide is useless and does not relate to what actually appears on the screen. My hardware meets all the specs. This is a bad product executed poorly. Support has been useless. Two patches were sent that did nothing. and the window to return it is faster than the slow and useless help. What a disappointment. and for USD300. Sheesh.,1,0,381
A1JJOV69MAU2J2,99,Perhaps the only bummer with the Palm V series is that they have a slow serial port connection. which takes much longer to Sync than a USB port. Id recommend buying the USB PalmConnect kit instead. which costs about the same. Shop around.,3,0,238
A1JJOV69MAU2J2,0,This product does its job. Which is to protect the Palm. .They can. and do. break. you know. if you drop them without protection..The strap holds the Palm in the case securely. as does the ingenious snapin docking mechanism. There are slots for two or three credit cards and a side slot for some cash. But this only works as a wallet in a pinch.On the down side. the case does roughly double the depth of the Palm Vx. but the way I see it. thats the price of protection.,4,1,470
A1JJRKEOKBNNOX,1519,I purchased the Lightweight Stereo Headphones .HP200F. September 18. 2006 as a replacement for the default Apple earbuds that came with my Ipod. During my first night of using the HP200F. they worked fine. I was actually impressed by their sound quality. particularly given their extremely reasonable price. However. the very next day. the audio in the left headphone began to cut in and out. I could only fix it by moving the cord around and holding it in an awkward position. I must reiterate that at this point I had had the headphones for less than a full day. I did not drop them or damage them in any way. While this was barely tolerable. I continued to use them because as I said. the sound quality was good. the price was right. and I had no other headphones. On the evening of the 20th. two days after my inital purchase. I attempted to listen to my Ipod using these headphones. only to discover that not only was the left earpiece cutting out. but now the right one was as well. Even after continued manipulation of the cord position. I could only recover slight audio in the right earpiece. These headphones suffered complete failure TWO DAYS after I purchased them. No matter how cheap the price. this is unacceptable. Ive purchased a variety of Maxell products in the past. and Ive always been reasonably satisfied with them. However. this experience has turned me off the brand for good.,1,0,1401
A1JJTFB80EYTAD,23,Ok. the features list and the configuration make this look like a great product.  Functions as either a mobile CB with a very small footprint. or as a handheld. NOAA Weather stations. easy to use. Looks good so far. But. as a radio. its just plain junk.Range as a handheld with the provided antenna is only around 100ft or so between two identical units. and thats with the squelch control turned off. So an external antenna is mandatory for pretty much any use.  Even when you get good reception. the audio quality from the built in speaker is flat and hard to hear.Using it while driving is the worst situation at all. since the radio is severely impacted by ignition noise from your car. Yes. this is something that you have to deal with when using just about any twoway radio. so its not like a different brand would eliminate the problem. but this unit does not appear to have any builtin filtering to help with the issue.,2,0,927
A1JK7I2C98VF1U,22,This product has worked acceptably for me for about two years.  Other reviewers are on to something when they point out that its water resistant but not waterPROOF.  That issue seems to have stung me too.  The volume knob has been affected by the water to the point where it has two settings. too low and too loud.  Another reviewer pointed out that the hanging the radio by the strap places the controls out of sight and reach.  This is also annoying but. I primarily only listen to one or two stations so all I need are the on and off buttons.  As for TV station reception. I find this a curious and somewhat useless feature .I mean. its not like it gets *cable*..,3,0,666

A1JLT4LBC7Y2XE,2929,This battery pack. when new and when fully charged. will take around 200 pictures. taken rapid fire on an old PowerShot S10. until completely drained .it wont even playback pictures.. Thats enough to fill up one 128MB flash card at 1600 1200 resolution. medium compression. I was very surprised. I inherited this camera and immediately got a new battery pack and realized that this camera is not the power hog as I once thoughtthe previous owner seriously didnt take care of the batteries. and before I learned the intricacies of NiMH batteries. neither did I.To prolong your battery life. be sure to drain the battery completely before charging again. NiMH batteries capacities drop if you keep u0026quottopping it offu0026quot before a trip if it was only half drained. Also. do not leave your battery on the charger. especially if you have two batteries. Ive done it. and I know. They become anemic and drop out after 4 or 5 shots.Just thought this piece of information would be useful.Canon would be thanked profusely if they released a Lithium Ion version .and charger. for this battery. so that we can avoid this battery conditioning nonsense and u0026quottopoffu0026quot whenever we like!,4,1,1195
A1JNKYGN9T5JO9,1517,Love this camera Editing software on my PC is easy. You dont need to buy lots of HI8 or Digital8 tapes because you can just copy what you recorded onto a regular VHS tape on your VCR.  This camera is so easy to use I  didnt really need the manual to figure anything out.  I dont see the need  to go to the 510 unless you want a slightly bigger LCD. Make sure you buy  an extended battery,5,1,387

A1JR07OWH0XA5Z,2020,I had the sony reader before. brought it back. because I had problems downloadingbooks from the public library. I bought the nook. and I love it.

That was very important to me.,5,1,346
A1JRWN50MPG8EH,12,Given the wealth of reviews. I thought this wall mount would be a safe bet. Unfortunately. it never even made it onto the wall.The bolts securing the swing arm were tightened so far. the arm could not be moved. .Its worth noting that the enclosed instructions *do* mention that in some cases. the bolts may need to be adjusted manually. Unfortunately. these were so tight. they could not even be loosened with a wrench..After about half an hour of struggling with it. I returned it as defective. Better luck next time.,2,0,518
A1JS0136L2PLWA,39,I have been watching the Nook since I was in Seattle during Easter and was determined to purchase one for my wife for her birthday.This happened last week and I also purchased one for myself.We werent able to Register them until we went back to a B u0026 N store and without any problem we registered them both in a flash.Then came the big let down! We tried to download a book each. in my case I tried to download Tom Sawyer. and my wife some type of Mystery book. We got to the point where we picked our books but were declined from downloading. Time and time again we tried with the help of a very knowledgeable sales associate. but all to no avail.We were then informed because we live in Canada. and my Credit Card has a Canadian Address. we were not able to download any books.This was total disappointment. for of all the ereaders that I had looked at and read about. the Nook was the best by far.We didnt want to take a chance and bring them back home and find out we couldnt download books here in Canada and sadly returned them with the covers etc for a full refund. which was processed in a very quick fashion with plenty of apologies.I was prepared to take mine and bring it back and take a chance on being able to download them here. but I didnt see myself being able to get back to the US to return it within the stipulated 2 weeks that we had to return them at full refund.We are extremely disappointed as we were really impressed with these fine readers and were hoping to have them to take with us on our next holiday which is a River Cruise in Europe.Nobody from the local store nor from Nooks support site could answer our inquiry as to when they might transcend our friendly border with the USA. so we are still very disappointed.If somebody has successfully done what we were trying to do. please post a notice about it and let us know.I dont know what reader we would look at now.,5,1,1902

A1JSO7PPEA0W72,9091,I bought a Nikon Coolpix .my first digital camera. about a six months ago and am very satisfied with it.  Previously. I had owned a Nikon 35 MM u0026quotpointandshootu0026quot camera. but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures NOW. the ability to send JPG images to freinds and relatives. the  ability to delete pictures u0026quotontheflyu0026quot. etc.  What I got was a  mixed bag of results  mostly positive.Before I go any further. I must  advise you to get the following options.  two sets of rechargable NiMH  batteries which should be standard with the camera .I use the Kodak ones  available at Amazon.com.. a highercapacity memory card .I use a 128 MB San  Disk  Nikons OEM.. and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly  the serial cable is just too slow.  I have purchased a SanDisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the PCMCIA slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transfer.Anyways. in use the camera is  fantastic.  Initially. I was using the 640X480 resolution setting to save  space. but with the new. larger card. I now use the 1600X1200 setting with  moderate compression for all pictures.  I find that the card can hold about  100 pictures at this resolution.  Once I find a picture I like. I use the  Microsoft Photo Editor software .comes with Office. and reduce the  resolution as appropriate .web pages. etc...  I store my  u0026quotkeepersu0026quot on CDROM at the higher resolution  you can always  reduce resolution and size.The picture quality is great.  The flash.  however. should only be used up to 10  any further and your pictures come  out too dark.  Nikon USA has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download  which I recommend.Low points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off!  I find myself zooming out every time I turn the camera on  this eats up  your batteries and takes time.  The flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time.  Sometimes. the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures. so a bit of spontaneity is  lost.There are now newer cameras out there.  I find that the 2.1  Megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that. given the  recent price reductions. I would buy this Nikon now if I were in the market  today.,4,1,2420
A1JSO7PPEA0W72,1919,Like the previous reviewer. I also purchased the Kodak NiMh batteries and charger and have found it to be a muchneeded improvement to the standard package.  Too bad Nikon doesnt include this as standard equipment with its  digital cameras.  My wish list.  an automotible cigarettelighter adapter  so I can recharge batteries u0026quoton the flyu0026quot.  Overall. a quality  product that functions as advertised and provides good value for the money.,5,1,451
A1JSO7PPEA0W72,1717,I took this hub out of the box. plugged it in. connected it to our internal network and my two PCs about two months ago. and it has worked  flawlessly ever since.  All without reading the manual!  This hub is  perfect for me because I occasionally attach a legacy 10Mbps device and  dont need more than three ports .other than to link to our existing  network..One warning  if you have other Netgear hubs and equipment.  keep the power supplies separate.  I had a singlespeed 100Mbps hub and got  the power supplies mixed up.  The unit looked like it was working but  actually wasnt.  The power supplies look similar. the plugs are the same.  but I think the current andor voltages are different.Other than that.  this is a great product.  As I said earlier. it just works.  When you  factor in price. you cant miss.,4,1,816
A1JT9VIPCULWLK,2427,This casing is all the above as compared to all soft counterparts available. Though it does not offer the required shock resistance. it is an ideal casing for those who would require the Palm V to be slipped in u0026amp  out of pockets frequently. Springloaded to remain shut at all kept  times. the casings spine that attaches itself to the Palm V is rigidly  constructed. but is a pain to get it on u0026amp off the latter.A good  investment overall.,4,1,452
A1JT9VIPCULWLK,911,I have been using the Palm V for a couple of months now and I must say that it does indeed serve its functions very well. It is extremely compact in size with reasonably emphasised ergonomics. The Hot Sync works  flawlessly with speed and the character inputs are not difficult to  master.However. I have noticed that the screen tends to get very blurred  and foggy whenever this product is being used under approx. 2 degrees  Celsius. One would have expected anything like that to happen under only  extreme climatic conditions. The rubberised frontal flap supplied with it  is redundant as it offers zero protection to the overall integrity of the  product. which merely covers the pad area .Good excuse for all Palm V  owners to purchase an alternative cover..This product will stay on  despite the advent of new OS palmbased counterparts w alternative memory  expansion. as most .general. users will deem that facility  redundant.With its main unit. flap u0026amp .separate. hard casing being  manufactured in Malaysia. India u0026amp China respectively. one can deduce  that efficient u0026amp costeffective production has helped contribute to  3Coms global market.,4,1,1170

A1JX8B4O3WSNKG,5546,Mine doesnt like Memorex CDR audio disks. yielding a 50% OPRFAIL result. but so far 100% success with other brands tried.  Very easy to use.  Looks nice. yields superb quality digital audio disks.  Wonderful for archiving  u0026quotlostu0026quot oldies that can still be found around on tape in your  closet somewhere.  Would prefer the display numbers were a little clearer.  since a u0026quot7u0026quot is hard to distinguish from a u0026quot1u0026quot. but this  is a small concern.  Instantly see how much time is recorded or how much  remains available.  For manual track incrementation .where no clean.  threesecond pause exists between songs.. has excellent pause feature and  automatically increments track when resumed. with the remote providing a  very handy and reliable means of doing this.

A1JYPRIJG6SFZ2,1,This I can not recommend. Although the price and shipping fees were reasonable and the item arrived on time. it does NOT work. I own one already and I know how to use it properly. I have attempted to use it to charge multiple batteries and it will NOT charge them at all. The unit is supposed to charge a battery until fully charged. then turn off automatically. It does not do this. When plugging a battery into it. it lights up indicating that it is charging. However. after charging 2 different batteries for over 12 hours each. it neither charged the batteries nor turned off as it is supposed to do. I have no problem exchanging the item if the seller contacts me as I do need a second charger. but I definitely need it sent back. I need instructions from the seller on how to proceed. Until the item is returned and credit paid back or the item is exchanged. I can NOT recommend the item or seller positively.,1,0,915

A1JZHU0WUCTO4C,0,Good case. while not new to Kindle books I am new to Kindles. the Fire HD is my first one. I wanted some protection for it as well as something to hold it for me. I often read in bed and with this it stands up some. I wish it were more adjustable. The reality is the way I use it you have two choices. flat. or slightly inclined. The way the pictures show in the upper right it looks like it will stand almost upright. thats not practical for my purposes. I am not sure a case is made that would fit my desires. this is very nice although I felt overpriced.,4,1,557

A1K22IFHM99SVT,1111,... I bought these. and mine came with 1450 batteries. ...Another  note. It doesnt have an electric cord. just two plugprongs that flip out  and go into a socket.  Makes it very compact. somewhat elegant.  BUT. its  design is such that .1. it doesnt work well in a horizontal outlet. only  in a vertical outlet. i.e. where the switch plate is a vertical rectangle.  In a horizontal outlet. the box ends up hanging precariously on its side.  prone to falling out of the wall.  .2. if you happen not to have the lower  outlet open. it doesnt sit readily in the upper outlet because its upside  down so the weight of the batteries tends to pull it away from the wall.  So far it hasnt fallen out in this position. but its probably gonna some  day.  Personally. I think a regular electric cord and plug would have been  better  I suspect Kodak just wanted to save a few bucks. and calls it a  u0026quotfeatureu0026quot.  Other than that its okay. but why did I really spend  this much money?  As long as its UL listed. buy yourself a cheaper  recharger from a major brand name. and make sure its intended for nimh  batteries if thats what you want.,4,1,1144

A1K2Q0OI20VB24,0,It is nice to have color coded cables in order to keep track of what goes where. I recently rewired my office and have now colorcoded everything. and it is making things MUCH easier. Its nice to know the external network drive is purple. and the networked printer is yellow. etc...,4,1,281
A1K2SHKYSQSSFO,11,nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends. depending on their needswants.SIDELOAD= downloading a ebook from your computer hard drive to your ereader. weather sony or nook. this is done through the usb cable that plugs into the side of your ereader and also recharges the battery of your ereader. while you sideload or just for recharging.all ebooks should be backed up on computer hard drive first because there is no retrieving an ebook from a ereader . Dont move an ebook. instead copy the ebook on the ereader u0026 retain  the original download on computer hard drive because you might want to read it again in 10 years.MY NOOKi like MY nook because it is light wieght and the batteries last 1 month between recharges and it holds 500 books and has a slot to accept up to 32 gb flash drive memory. just in case i want my nook to hold 1000 books. and nook has a really bright white screen .like expensive ink jet paper.If you leave wi fi  on .nook battery only last 2 weeks between recharge. with wi fi off .battery last 4 weeks.My sony prs 300 ereader screen looks kinda grayish in compairson to nook. but only when they are side by side.my sony ereader screen looks just fine by itself .My sony ereader prs 300is less than 12 price of nook. but has no wifi u0026 only holds 9 books but allows you to delete books one at a time or 4 at once. so you always can make room for 3 or 4 new books. sonys battery needs recharge thru usb cord every 2 weeks.but the sony can change from portriat to landscape orentation. so i can hold my sony ereader sideways. when i read in bed.on my back  with the ereader held up over my head. My nook cant do this.sony prs300 works with .epub u0026 .pdf u0026 sony reader software that you download onto your computer. the email address for sony reader is inside sony ereader. sony reader for your computer is a epub u0026 pdf reader 4 your computer that lets you download free internet books and copy them to the sony reader library .where you can read the ebook on your computer and also sideload  a copy of the ebook.through the ubs2 cable  into your sony ereader  prs300the sony reader reconizes the sony ereaderprs 300 and allows sideloads.nook wieghts 6 oz and sony wieghts 8 oz. so not much difference in wieght.And nook has wi  fi .incase i want to pay USD12.00 for a book instead of downloading the book for free on to my computer.There might just be a situation where i cant get to my computer to get a free book and i was so bored that i was willing to pay for a wifi book. but i dont think so. the filthy rich would like the wi fi 12.99 book .though.I thought that the nook touch screen would be cool . but it is kind of a pain the the butt because the nook changes pages when ever your finger gets even close to the screen. weather you want to change pages or not. So.you spend 30 % of you time .just trying to find the page you were just on. 2 seconds ago.But.after a while.you get used to this and its not really an issue.even though it continues to occur.Its the price you pay for a touch screen.the nook works with .epub and .pfd books and adobe digital editions. You should downloadadobe digital editions from downloadscnet.com  for free onto your computer and then download free internet books into your computer file that the internet puts them in and copy the file into adobe digital editions library. adobe lets you look atread the book on your computer and see if you want to sideload it into your nook. adobe digital editions will reconnize your nook when you plug in the usb cord and has a drop down menu button that says copy ebook to nook.SIDELOAD means plug usb2 cable that comes with nook into computer and into nook. this cable recharges the nook battery and at the same time allows you to download .epub and .pdf ebooks u0026 files into you nook.WHAT I REALLY HATE ABOUT THE NOOK  is you cant delete just 1 book or just 20 books.you have no choice.you must delete all the books on the nook.Because of this.backup on to your computer any book you download into nook. as you cant retrieve anything from nook. You must delete every thing all at once and start from empty all over again.A very bad feature nook should change as soon as possible.The saving grace is the large 500 book capacity of the nook and the slot to install a 32 gb flash drive memory stick so that nook can hold 1000 books. You wont have to delete it all and start over for a long time .nook requires you go to barnes u0026 noble to open an account u0026 register the nook before nook will work. The Bu0026N salespeople will do it 4 you. or you can do it yourself.if you like to read u0026 follow instructions. When you delete nook . you have to reregister nook at barnes u0026 noble all over again.most people will be out of range of Bu0026N wifi .so you wont be able to register nook without a trip to Bu0026N to get in range of the wi fi.,4,1,4927
A1K5LVT31CG1IH,22,I received my first nook almost a year ago. Right out of the box the power button jiggled back and forth and it very rarely turned on and off for me via the button. Then 2 months in my Nook stopped responding to me. It was just frozen on the screensaver and no matter whether I plugged it into the computer or the wall. it didnt respond. I called the company and was told to bring it into my nearest story .which is about an hour and half away.. She got it to charge and boot up for me saying that the battery was dead even though I had fully charged it the previous day. FFWD 9 months and my nook still kept freezing. It would freeze while reading a book. or browsing the Bu0026N store or wouldnt load up from the screen saver. The only way to reboot it was to plug it into the wall and it would reboot. My final straw was when I could no longer unplug my Nook due to it freezing. The second I unplugged it. it would freeze on me and Id have to repeat the process of plugging it in and waiting for it to start up for me. I called the company. they arranged for me to pick up a new Nook at the closest store and I drove down to get my new Nook. Apparently. as you might have guessed. my Nook had a faulty battery. There was no hassle returning the Nook and the guy even let me test drive the new one before walking out of the store to make sure I was happy with it. The first thing I noticed besides the fact that it didnt immediately freeze up on me was the fact that the power button was secure and didnt jiggle at all.So since Ive gone through two separate Nooks. the latest showing minimal signs of problem. Id say this is a decent product. Maybe I just happened to get the lemon of the lot? I still enjoy reading from my nook. Its a light weight device and small enough that it fits in my purse with ease. The eink screen makes it easier to read for extended periods of time without having to take a break due to a headache. The long life battery .when not a dud. lasts long enough for my 20 hr flight and a week without needing to be charged or turned off. Since Ive gotten the replacement Nook a month ago. Ive only needed to plug it in once. I also like that when I take it outside to read. there is no glare on the screen. It really is as if you are reading a book. except less bulky. I like being able to highlight and make notes in the book. it makes going back for references much easier. With a book. I would take a strip of paper and put it between the two pages. to later go back and reread them to figure out why I put the paper there. Even though I had a less than ideal experience with being a Nook owner I do enjoy the device. I always carry my Nook with me everywhere I go.,4,1,2693
A1K5XKQO2PYEWC,11,This is just a micro USB cable.  You can buy this anywhere for a few dollars.  Newegg sells it for USD3,1,0,103
A1K775TKUNZL43,1618,Wouldnt recommend to anyone. Through my 1 click settings. I accidentally placed an order for 2. I never opened the second nook. I kept it in the shipping box to show it was never tampered with. They said I could return. but because it didnt come back to them within 2 weeks. they denied the return and told me I need to figure a way to get it back myself. As a manager myself. I KNOW that is very POOR customer service. There are many places to chose from and this one doesnt have anything special that stands out about them. I suggest ANYONE else! Dont waste your time on this company. If you end up having an issue. the service you receive will likely be unsatisfactory. Hope this review helps!,1,0,696
A1K8WI1EO187YS,16,The cBear external CD burner is quiet and reasonably fast. It takes about 15 minutes to burn a music CD. and doesnt interfere with anything else on the computer while it is running. My laptop .Windows XP. had no trouble writing to the device. and it needs no software installed. Also. it arrived quickly. A great product!,5,1,321
A1K9FVW3BQKUM,22,Got these speakers about a month ago. have them wired through my TV and CD player.  Good enough value.  Heavy. solid wood design.  Youll smell the wood when you open them up.  More bulky than they appear. but good sound to back them up.,4,1,236
A1K9YK4JQ3Y7EE,0,I love my Rio. but it has a major flaw in the design  if theres a short in the headphone connection .either in the plug or in the jack.. the short may cause the Rio to do odd things .mine occasionally pauses for no reason.  even with new headphones..  Simply having this remote plugged in seems to  have solved the problem. and even if thats not the case. its far easier  to unpause it with the remote than digging the Rio out of my pocket.  opening the case. etc...,5,1,466
A1KAERT0MPBZOO,46,What I like about this labeling tape is the precut line running along the back of the backing paper. It makes it very easy to remove the label from the backing paper when youre ready to stick the label.I did have one bad experience with loading this labeling tape in the past. The tape jammed upon installation and I had to throw out a new tape. You can avoid this by being careful during tape installation.,4,1,407

A1KBUEP4FIEGBN,111,This player is truly kicking some serious butt. I recently bought one. as well as one for my friend. The quality is absolutely excellent. It looks cool. though not exactly like the one in the picture. I let the ESP warm up  and I shook it like there was no tommorrow and it didnt even miss a beat.  Overall a very very good product and I highly reccomend it. plus speedy  delivery.,5,1,381
A1KD8NJPZ01R37,44,...Im so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases.

A1KFKL143V0M0U,0,I received this as a christmas present. I will admit that when opening I was somewhat disappointed with the ereader I got .yes. I did want an ereader though.. Because I had actually asked for the kindle touch. but I soon became happy with the NST. Here is my thought process...*Even though the Kindle has text to speech .and not NST.. people online pointed out that it seemed very robotic. which would make me not want to use that feature.*The Kindle DOES have audiobooks .unlike the NST. but most audio books are about 30 hours. and I would rather read than sit for that time.*The Kindle also has a web browser. but an eink display is not really ment for internet use. making it slow and laggy. Thus it is not really a advantage.*Barnes u0026 Noble actually has stores to go and ask questions*On the nook. you can change the wallpaperscreensaver.*You can do that ^ on the kindle but you have to hack it first.Although I do think that the Kindle IS a better device. it a lot more expensive if you want no ads. I just would like you to remember that this is my thought process and everyone has their own opinion. I HAVE been using the nook a lot and I think it is a great device to.ONE FINAL THING. I have noticed that I have only used my nook for a week and it is already low on battery .the battery life is supposed to be 2 months.. Given... I have used it nonstop so I can understand why. That is why I gave 5. not 4...  just wanted to point that out.,4,1,1453
A1KFS7EKT2OYL2,33,This cable works well with my T3i. this best thing is that it is 10ft. long so you dont have to be right next to your tv to review your photos and video....,4,1,156
A1KFWYUVIPJTLQ,0,This mount is much lower priced than anything I have seen in the retail stores .including Walmart.. It is a little flexible u0026 wobbly. so it would not be the best in an area where kids would mess with it.  That is the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars.  I use it in a bedroom up high. where it wont be messed with.  It does everything I need it to do at a great price. so it is perfect for me.,4,1,398
A1KFY8MKQGJINV,0,I ordered. as advertised a new 16gb NOOK Color.  When my order arrived it was a refurbished. 8gb NOOK Color. I returned it and requested the product as advertised.

A1KH8PK0ZQG2M5,23,I thought that this would be pretty with my pink Ipod.  But it does not have a clip so that I can where the ipod while moving around. it slides on a belt. which if you are a women. is not very practical.  And. worse yet.  the opening for the earphone jack is either not aligned or large enough.  I have to take the eyepod out of the case to use it.  The case is just used for when I put it in my briefcase or purse so that it doesnt get scratched.,1,0,447
A1KHMPC1CIL9D6,0,Ive been clinging on to my old trackball because it is so well designed.  The new ones are either awkward. too large. etc.  I do occassionally clean it.

A1KI0YD0FG66M8,0,I have had this player for close to 3 months now. It has performed well until now. With the release of Disney DVDs. I have begun to notice some flaws. First off... Hercules .Ive exchanged 3 times. freezes in the middle of u0026quotZero To Herou0026quot .Chapter 17.. Next off. Mulan... at least it  plays all the way through except for the sound fading away in some  sequences. I guess if someone asked my opinion. I would say. u0026quotbetter  get an extended service contract and keep your Disney on VHSu0026quot. As an  after thought I would mention that the Hecules DVD ran fine on my PCDVD  drive.,2,0,602
A1KI21IXOGI3LG,1116,The last keyboard I bought was USD55 and worked just fine til my granddaughter dumped her orange juice into it. I was wary of the very lost cost of this new keyboard but decided I couldnt go far wrong at that price. Well. its great! Just as good as the much much more expensive one. I feel so clever now for getting it!,5,1,319
A1KKHE3R5PBZ7Q,44,This is the biggest MD case I could find. but of course its way too small for any real collection. Why couldnt they also offer one of double thickness that holds 48? And perhaps add one row and one column to hold 9 discs per page instead of 4  that would make a case holding 108 minidiscs that would be about the size of my old 150 disc CD case.Ah well... this is the best case that exists right now.,4,1,400
A1KKUYTDUZDZSA,13,The first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it doesnt come with software for handhleds. That person chose to buy it without and save some USDUSD and then complained about having to pay extra for it because heshe bought the wrong software package.  Delorme did the right thing and offered us options.  I just ordered mine and I have no plans on using with a HH so Im very happy that I didnt have to buy the HH software.  Just dont be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it.  Nemerous people have highly recommended this to me. although I have heard that MS Mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option.  Storing 50.000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome.  I will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route. elevation. etc.  Too bad it is only in Yellow...,4,1,904
A1KM3IPZ9H0JKZ,713,It took about 10 mins to install this TV Wall Mount with a 48 inch Samsung TV.  It does the job. there are much more expensive arms. but this does the trick.,4,1,157

A1KOPU3JV7ZO8V,515,I bought this mic for my second gen ipod touch and it works great. It is all i expected it to be. unfortuneltely when i spin it around in the headphone jack. it sometime cuts out. Iknow its not my headphone jack .since thats a common problem with itouchs. so That is the only downside.,4,1,285
A1KPX073081C2S,0,I ordered this speaker system to replace a terrible pair that came with my computer. I figured anything would be better. Well.these are better sounding.but just added new problems. First off.I knew these would not be audiophile quality.but the first MP3 I put on to test them.showed the subwoofer can not handle much bass. It was popping with the volume low. Terrible. The other problem I had.is the volume control. I can deal with the stupid design.but it has a short in it.and I have to keep wiggling it to get sound from both satellites. If you are looking for just a cheap pair of speakers.these are the ones to get. For the price I paid.it is not really worth the time and effort to mail em back.etc.. Ill just have to deal with new problems after dealing with the old ones..  Id shop around.,2,0,797
A1KQYHCLGQIB0P,46,The cover is too big for the iPad .first generation.. it can slip out of the opening.  The print is nice and so far we have had it a few months and it is holding up fine. we just need to be aware that it could slip out.  We did put 2 sheets craft foam cut to size on the backside of the ipad which helps alittle.,1,0,312
A1KR3NI3GHHTI5,0,really enjoy the fact that the stupid nook flips the pages without me touching the screen to the point that i have finally given up after 3 hours of trying to get this to work. Get a ipad or a actual book. folks.,1,0,212

A1KTAQ9J3XA6SY,0,I was very excited when I first listened to the excellent sound quality and used the full compliment of controls on this tiny unit.  .syncrorecord. optical record. plus full track editing tools.  However...after only a couple of months it has begun to skip badly and is  basically  a USD300.00 paperwieght.  I kept it clean. out of the sun and only  played it a couple hours a day and it is completely broken.  I thought the  lithiumion battery might need replacement. but I got a rude surprise when  I found out they are ONLY available from Sharp via mailorder and cost  **USD50.00**.  The optional AA battery pack is also only available from Sharp  and is on back order till August .maybe..  I have to wait 2 months to find  out if the battey is even the problem. and if it isnt. then the thing is  truly worthless after only 100 hours or so of gentle use.  This is  immensely frustrating because the unit is really fantastic when it is  working correctly.  The little remote controller is super cool. and it  comes with really good headphones.  In the end. it must be said that Sharp  has not worked out the bugs in MD technology. and someone looking for a  good value SHOULD AVOID BUYING THIS UNIT.,1,0,1202
A1KUMUXRXME0FA,44,I am very pleased with this radio.. I read the reviews before purchasing it and they were very positive. Its small and light weight..

A1KV6V3UAQY91F,0,The product is good and I have no complaints. but the picture displayed is misleading. The picture shows 2 units but when you order it you only get one unit.

A1KXONFPU2XQ5K,59,I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.

It is decent quality. and it worked well for me.,4,1,357

A1KYJ2CV9IJUYD,0,I purchased this card in the beginning of the year and pretty much kept it in my phone the entire time. A few weeks ago my phone kept freezing up when I tried to look at my photos. I took the card out to see if that was the issue and it was. I am unable to format the card on my computer or my phone. so there is no way for me to fix the issue. It is simply broken  and I have no idea why. Very frustrating. I did back up most of my photos regularly. but still lost a few things. DO NOT BUY!,1,0,491
A1KYKLOQWQ2X3E,0,Ok. so it DOES bring in at 352x240 with stereo sound. but it can only bring in with MPG1 format. not the best to begin with. If you plan to edit video on your computer then output it to VHS or back to the Camcorder. forget it. THIS SYSTEM CANNOT OUTPUT FROM YOUR COMPUTER. I ended buying the ADS Technologies TV Elite XGA to do the output with. I will eventually look for a system that can input at a higher resolution .preferably uncompressed full screen AVI.. Until then. I will continue to use the DAZZLE system. but do not recommend it to anyone.,2,0,550

A1L0MEXMESE4C4,0,received the product and got it installed today. for the most part I am pretty happy with the hardware except the materials being used to make screws or other parts. the screws get very easily damaged by the most commonly used screw drivers that you can find for USD1 per piece.  Once I put the bolt into the LCD TV and mount it with the plate. I found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver. which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms.  is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nuts?,3,0,645

A1L2RW1RALJF85,1636,Ive had my 702 for over two years now. and it still works fairly well. Yes. I said two years  and I still only paid about USD75 more than the list price on this discontinued model.About a year in. I got the infamous   UTOC error  on a disk. Went to Best Buy and bought a Maxell MD  cleaner .after taking the silly thing apart. etc. trying to u0026quotfixu0026quot  it.. Ran the cleaner three times. and everything was fine. I can still  record. but I have to clean it more often now .every couple of months.. or  I get the errors .or skipping disks. again. I run my 702 between 8 and 48  hours per week.All I can say is. if you have a cleaner for your CD  player. and your DVD player. and your VCR. and a cleaner for your cassette  player. WHY DONT YOU HAVE ONE FOR YOUR MD? If you have a dead 702 because  of UTOC. why dont you spend a few bucks and see if you can fix it?,4,1,873

A1L3U9ZRIBJEHJ,0,This is great camera with many features. You can take the pictures in many conditions. The flashlight is good enough for Indoor shooting. You can use the AREC mode for automatic shooting u0026amp MREC mode for manual Shooting. You will have a great photos just using AREC mode. Just switch on the bottom u0026amp ready to take photos. If you want more professional photos use MREC mode. You can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture. In this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light. The 2.11 mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web. sending though Email u0026amp print in A4 paper. The worst think that I know is a battery live. This camera its so hungry with power. that I thought same with the others digicam. For your convenient use a 3 set of NIMH batteries. which can take 30 to 40 pictures each set in normal used. You can save your battery live with minimize using LCD monitor to framing the object.,4,1,977

The selling point for me was its virtual surround capabilities. despite the  fact that I own a dolby digital ready audio system. its an attractive  touch since its not always convenient to set up for surround sound.  And  with this feature in mind. shopping for a DVD player was made MUCH easier  due to the fact that I could eliminate so many other possibilities. Also.  the unit is incredibly light and easily transportable from location to  location. and with extras like a DTS output and HDCD support make it all  the more worth the price tag.  Why not five stars?  I hate the access times  and the fact that its almost impossible not to overshoot when  fastforwarding and rewinding the image that appears on screen when doing  this can be many seconds behind .takes some real getting used to..  But.  being an early generation device. this is certainly negligable.,4,1,1008
A1L6DUSGDJP8S9,22,I guess i got what i paid for. considering i paid less than 30 for it. works sparingly. should have waited and spent my hard earned money else where.,2,0,149
A1L6HR2L59IRQD,1,Installed two of these units. Primary alarm use was the  current and shock sensors. Works great. The siren is good  and loud. Instructions are easy to follow and the system  provides a lot of extra capabilities. A supplimental device  was also added to complement the Bulldog. Installation  took 15 minutes on each system to decide location of siren  and wiring harnesses. Another 1015 for a hidden location  for the control box .not under dash..size of cigarette pack..  Harness connector is keyed so it fits only one way. Arrived  in less than one week.,4,1,555
A1L6PBIR22S3FA,23,The only reason that I use this charger is in case I have a battery that is too dead to charge with my wonderful Maha MHC801D charger.  Unfortunately the Maha MHC801D needs some slight residual charge remaining for the processor to initiate a charge. so that is why I sometimes need to use this Energizer CHM4FC for around a half a minute to give the battery just enough juice for the Maha MHC801D to initiate a charge.  The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is. but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging.  The Maha can even erase the memory effect of old batteries.  At least the Energizer CHM4FC does not burn up the batteries like those terrible life shortening 15 minute chargers however.,3,0,752
A1L6T2D1T5ZN5B,0,These were not new tapes.  I have only used one so far. but it had definitely been used before and not been completely erased.,3,0,126
A1L7EZGH3YAKQI,0,The fact that this device is made to load on windows 9598 and not XP must have been written in small print. because I didnt see it.  As I was completing the order the Amazon window popped up saying people who ordered this unit also ordered smart cards and among those offered was a 128 mb card I figured. hey more music. so I added one to my order.  When I got the unit the blurb on the side of the box said you could expand it to 96mb no more.  It makes no difference since the software wont load anyway.  Thanx Amazon I have a nice little...paper weight.,1,0,556
A1L8C4LX3DUNOL,0,This memory card holds sooooooo much memory for my phone. I received it in the mail about a week ago and i am very happy with the purchase.  So far i have 174 pictures on my phone. about 50 contacts. and 20 recorded sounds in addition to the ones it came with.  That takes up 34MB1.8GB.  I know it might be hard to understand how much that really is. but on my phone there is a place to go that shows a bar of memory usage.  The tiniest corner of the bar about the size of a very skinny pencil line is red for the stuff i have on there right now. and the rest is white meaning there is a ton of empty space left for much more pictures. sounds. and contacts. I love how i can easily take the card out of the phone and put it in the adapter and put it right into the slot for a SD card in my computer. It makes it so easy to send. print. enlarge pictures from my phone or whatever i want to do. I really recommend purchasing this item because it holds a lot of memory and i promise you will be more than satisfied with your purchase.,5,1,1031
A1L9EX57IJUA6K,33,Very simple product at good price and works fine without any issues.  Fair price and could not be found locally.  Fortunate it was able to found brand new at this site.,5,0,168
A1L9T511N7PLGG,12,Id be careful to listen to these speakers before buying.  They have the advantage of being cheap. and sound OK at low listening levels.  However. turn up the volume and youll get hissing like youre living in a snake pit.  Theres no volume on the subwoofer.  To make matters worse. once you increase the bass level. I ended up with very annoying crackle with the right front speaker badly breaking up.  I have a cheap subwoofer and two satellite speakers purchased at the local computer show that sound much better.  Ill just buy two cheap rear speakers to plug into my SB Live for the rears.If youre looking for something with decent sound and bass. your best looking elsewhere and spending a little more.,1,0,705
A1LAT21BT7FUXX,26,This cartridge fits well and Ive purchased it a few times already. It works well and has no problems. It is authentic and cost effective for our needs. Labeling leftovers in the fridge so that we dont poison ourselves with 2 month old food that should have been thrown out last week.,4,1,283
A1LB5R512TL077,0,It has already broken after one use I have to wedge paper under it to hold in order to charge but it is better than nothing.,3,0,124
A1LBDR75J3EW3F,0,This is advertised as a USB chargingdata transfer cable for the Padfone2. As shown. it is NOT the correct cable.,1,0,112
A1LBNAE3BQW19J,11,I received it. but thats the only thing good I can say.  The liquid was all dried up.  If you are some of the few of us that are left who are trying to preserve our VCRs. dont buy a wet head cleaner.  Go for a dry one.  Maxell is the best. but I havent bout one through Amazon.  I borrowed my parents video head cleaner.  Two other recommendationstape on the slowest playit eats up the hours on the tape. but you get a much better picture.  And get a VCR rewinder.,1,0,464
A1LCWEZ04BMAIO,0,Excellent value!!! Sound quality is satisfactory. and the 9+ footlong cord provides a high degree of freedom while using these headphones. The only drawback  no local volume control. Cushioned earpieces provide a  good degree of comfort while simultaneously dampening noise from the  headphones so that others are not annoyed by your music  a good buy if  you are a college student with roommates.,5,1,397
A1LD7Z5GOPGHR5,33,ive tried to install this piece of ... for a week on 3 diferent computers .my p3 with win2000. and a friends p2 with win98. and another frieds p3 with winXP. None. i repeat NONE was able to put this thing playing image. ive download everything for every hardware situation but it was worthless. After beeing really beaving like an obseesed maniac. ive quit! My actually concerned right now is that ive bought it in Portugal and ime right now in italy and cant return it. and the support offered by pinnacle is like the board. Luky u guys that were able to install it!,1,0,567
A1LDH3BX7Y3S8A,23,Bought these replacement tapes for our little labeler. The tapes are the right size and work fine in the labeler. One caveat. I used this tape to make labels for our call box outside. The call box has a protective lexan cover. but the sun still faded the tape to the point where its very difficult to read. So. dont use this tape outside unless its completely protected from sunlight. Otherwise. we use it to label everything from pantry items to window screens. Highly recommended.,5,1,482
A1LDKW1EX1JAZ4,0,This Directv system is wonderful. You can have access to all cable channels. also local channels through the same dish antenna without having to spend extra money for another dish. Also. going from one channel to  another is very rapid compared to the other big company. But there is one  thing that is not that great. if you live in a place where there is a lot  of big storms. the signal will fade and eventually. youll lose the signal  for a few minutes. The samething will happen if you have a snow build up on  the dish antenna. But besides that. the Directv RCA system is wonderful.  Great value. sound and image!,4,1,619
A1LDLEWKACKEI0,3436,Works great out of the box. Never had a single problem connecting my HD camcorder to my LCD TV.,5,0,95
A1LE0TJ3UYVV7X,11,Awesome. great wall mount for TV. came with 2. 212  lag bolts and a vast assortment of hard ware. so much hardware you should be able to mount any TV to the mount.  Mount is hidden completely behind TV yet looks attractive. folds to just a few inches from the wall or pulls out to position. easy to adjust angle adjustment and came with clips to keep the cord from being pinched inside the mount.  Shipped and arrived very quickly.,5,1,431
A1LF4HL31Y65LW,0,I found the DC265 to be an excellent product with intuituve features and highquality images. The USB connection is idiotproof and fast. And the technical support I got from Kodak when needed was good. The accompanying  software for managing your shots is simple and effective but not very  sophisticated at image manipulation. The only drawback to the camera which  takes a little gettingused to is the apparent delay from when you depress  the shutter release til it actually releases. Probably more of an  adjustment issue from using regular SLRs.,4,1,549
A1LFJPLJE0SKOI,11,Quite a few of these reviews mentioned a greater than 3v output after full charge. This was indeed the case with the set I purchased which left me with 4 unusable batteries as a greater than 3v output is unacceptable in most high end gear.,1,0,239
A1LFPLFZDHDPZH,47,Used it on 2 of my CDs  followed instructions explicitly as I am an audio junkie  both CDs were useless after use.  Those that are skeptical please note that I cleaned in a straight line from center to edge  at a failure to understand how this product can be used successfully,1,0,276
A1LHCUV1YEFCDV,0,Not happy with my Nook.  Be forewarned...you can pay for some books and they will download but you cant open them.  How to avoid this? Open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for Nook..and not nook color or nook etc...just Nook.  Ive had to ask for credits several times already.There arent enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing. Maybe the Nook Color is a better bet?,1,0,436
A1LHIQCO5EZHZC,14,I show this version to seventh grade students. They mostly like it. however. they tend to dislike most of the singing.,3,0,118
A1LHPG9WZGL31,0,This zune case does it job. but I ended up taking it off a few days after I put it on. you need to purchase a screen protector as well if you want that. My biggest problem was the feel with the buttons.Next. back. the case forms this odd rubber circle around them so the button is inside the circle. and it was uncomfortable for me to push the buttons. After that I took it off and never put it back on.,2,0,403
A1LK6MVROMC0V4,12,The floppy eject button jammed and broke less than in a month. No more buing cheap floppy drives. I like the TEAC drives better as its easier to set them up in Windows 7 64bit environment.,2,0,188
A1LKPYHG80GFTZ,0,I share the Nikon 950 coolpix camera with my mom. she uses the serial cable provided. I would like to use a USB cable for it. but does anybody know where I can get a USB cable for this camera? Thanks for any help.,4,1,213
A1LKXQNNHK1NMO,310,This unit works as advertised.  Not the best charger I have ever used but not the worst.  It allows me to keep my Garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip.  .Could be real useful if you use your GPS city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot..  All in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other GPS accessories.,3,0,380
A1LL35PC63NXQP,0,I just bought a Palm IIIx and although the functionality of the machine is great. Ive had glitches with my unit.  I had problems performing the hotsync  maybe a problem with the unit or cradle and the batteries would  go dead after 23 days .this happened three times..  I also lost all my  data .twice. without any low battery warning.  Im getting a replacement  and I hope that this was a anomaly.,3,0,398
A1LLACL82ZONMN,1113,I still have my Sony DVD player and have had NO PROBLEMS whatsoever! I have 15 DVDs with five more coming and I just love the DVD player! NOT all players have the lip synch problem and even if I did experience Im  certaintly not gonna send it back! The good would definately outweigh the  bad. A simply awesome player that should be bought immediately by anyone  wanting a DVD player real badly. Spectacular player!,5,1,415
A1LLND2UADQL51,2249,I like this device.  but the software is flaky.  With 2 months of light use. after numerous lockhang issues. mine is a brick and cannot be be rebooted.  Bu0026N has offered a REFURB unit as a warranty replacement  underwhelming for such a new and obviously flawed device.  My experience is not unique. many have had similar issues.  It should not be that hard to deliver a bulletproof eReader. it has very limited function. not like a general purpose computer running code from various vendors.  Application codedevice driver stack is not strong.  Hardware appears to be reasonable.  Would be interesting to see a report from someone that knows specifics about the software shop that developed the Nook Simple Touch code.  The UI is learnable in a relatively short time.  but not intuitive as an eReader should be.  The eReader UI experience should be closer to an iPhone experience. instead of a VCR timer event recording from the 80s .like it is..  Recommendation to Bu0026N. get different software development team with experience writing bulletproof production code for 2.0.  Full rewrite of Nook Simple Touch code recommended.,2,0,1131
A1LM8DX9OVY2N3,11,Anyone who wants the best of both worlds. light. portable. fantastic display. This DVDL50 is a MUST purchase. I was leary about spending that much money on such an object. especially since I have 2 Macintosh  Towers.one with a DVD player. and a 3400c PowerBook that I can easely put a  DVD player in. My mind was blown when I took it on a plane to Tucson. AZ. I  watched 2 complete movies as the flight was 3.5 hr long. I find that it is  better to use in bed at night. then the large TVs with the nonportable  DVD players. I take some DVDs to bed with me so I can change disks. plus  it seems more intimate that way. especially with adult discs. The privacy  and magnificant sound with internal ear phones is better than anything I  have heard. You hear quiet things in the background that you never heard  before. Handles all cd types also. DVD.Video CDs. etc. I guarantee you  will love it. GET ONE,5,1,901
A1LMAD3NFQS6JB,0,This bag really works great for the camera with strap. a battery or two and a memory card. Thats it though dont plan on putting your car keys or cell phone in too it just wont work. Just the camera and thats about it. But. remember it is a camera bag!,3,0,251
A1LMBT0ST7TQEE,11,Broke the second day. need I say more?,1,0,38
A1LOJYG9XBVKX6,1113,The screen is good. overall its not a bad ereader.  3 quick issues.  First. the sticky rubber on the back is already peeling.  Second. you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi. and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.  Third. and worst of all. is you cannot sync books that are not purchased through nook to your phone.  This is really aggravating.,1,0,425
A1LPDIAKNVQNQ2,1,I cannot recognoze well how 7foot long because Im Japanese and the peoples other than US use metric unit. It doesnt wrok for my intension because too short!,2,0,156
A1LPUD5YTDY7IT,2,This cd case is my fav so far. The cds stay in place and the end sleeves are very durable. I filled it up and the sheets moved along smoothly. It doesnt come with a small inner net or a pocket though. Another good thing  about it is its handle on its spine and its great leather look. great cd  holder.,5,1,302
A1LQ3T1H0H5KL1,1722,Works fantastic on my Harley for what I use it for.  I ride in groups of bikes. and this CB allows me to communicate with others in the group. plus a little further.  Probably about a mile or so,5,0,194
A1LQ7MCDRV9HGW,34,Works fine for stationary object.  Dont use for hair products that move .i.e. flat iron. hair dryer..  It is loose.,3,0,115
A1LQPBPA37U1XF,0,I bought this for my Synology NAS but it did not fit the NAS and would come off very easily. Luckily I had another lock for my Thunderbolt display. I plugged this one in the Thunderbolt and it fit nicely. Quality seems good too so Im glad it worked out.When you buy this lock. make sure it fits your device.,4,1,307
A1LQQVMP2JLWV6,0,I have had my Color Nook for 3 or 4 months and cant say much about how well it works because most of the time I have spent with it has been fiddling with it trying to get it to connect to my WiFi or figure out why it freezes up when browsing photos.  It looks like it has potential. but overall its been a frustrating experience for me.  If you only want to connect to an unsecured neworks andor know enough about networks to quickly locate the MAC address on your router you might get along fine with it.  In hind sight. I would have been much better off spending USD600 or USD700 on a small light weight laptop.,1,0,613
A1LRDRNZU351CL,711,I love my giraffe print case. It is very professional. it can be propped up. and it isnt bulky. It has protected my screen from any scratches and I am not worried to put in my backpack and take it to classes.My only complaint would be the edges of the iPadt are exposed. I have a couple scratches around the edges. and I have purchased a skin to put the iPad in before I slip it into this cover case. I also wish it had pockets or sleeves to put things into it. Or a place to slip my stylus. Right now I just clip it to the spin of the cover.Overall it is a great buy. and I am very pleased with it.,4,1,599
A1LRRS6Q8N48EK,0,I just bought this. however. when I received the item it was scuffed on one corner. so I sent it back for an exchange. Just checked on that order and was told they refunded me instead. so I was to go in and purchase it again. Now its listed at USD31.99 .only 1 used item.no new items available. so it could be the one I returned. and I originally bought it for USD29.99. Buyer beware.,3,0,384
A1LRU6HKYFB5KX,2,It has far exceeded my expectations. Sounds great on DVD or Audio CDs. The party decode is unusual. allowing stereo CDs to sound 5.1ish.I did spend good money on speakers. especially a quality sub.As another reviewer wrote here. this is my favorite toy.,4,1,253
A1LS6ORDVFE053,0,I bought this little thing because I was traveling and needed something to keep me busy during layovers and delays.  But WOW.  The screen resolution is fine. especially with the choice of three screen sizes.  The sound is  excellent and then I discovered that I can hook it to my hotel room tv and  watch my movies for free.  Beware of holding it on your lap...the bottom  gets very hot after a while.  My Daughter loves it as well....we use for  those long car rides and those times when we go camping.  Pricey but worth  it...in my opinion!,5,1,542
A1LSO02HOVR14H,1818,I bought TWO of these for Christmas gifts to Grandparents u0026amp will return both.  Heres my beef.1. Sound is mono. not stereo2. The onscreen channel information is unreadable when the channels are changed.  The digits are less than one inch in height and the white numerals are  invisible on a light colored  background.3.  Picture quality and  stability have room for improvement.4.  Impossible to record one show  and watch another .this is pretty much normal for TVVCR sets  however..Money would be much better spent on a higher quality model. RCA  designers blew it on the display readout.,2,0,596
A1LSVLASFS6IEB,1271,This is a really great CD player. It loooks kewl and the ultra slim part really can in handy. All my friends are jealous of this!  It is a great CD  player BUT the only problem comes with the headphones. I like the inline  volume control. but they break really easily. It has been a month since I  bought it and Im back on Amazon looking for new headphones. So if you want  to have a kewl CD player and dont mind getting new headphones after a  while. this is for you!,4,1,468
A1LUMWAVTPP043,1112,I like other customers have had this camera for some time. 3coms customer support let me know quickly that they will not support it for XP. With that kinda customer service. 3com will NEVER EVER get my business again.,1,0,217
A1LW1R1TD6VR8P,46,Went on a cruise in Europe in Oct. 2012 and worked great on the ship and everywhere else we stopped...worked perfect had no issues has every kind of adaptor you need!!! worked perfect on cruise ships as well in Europe!!! would recommend this product!!!  Did not have any issues from previous reviews of being to lose when it was in use. worked perfect and love how all the pieces come together for easy carrying and for traveling!,5,1,430
A1LWYVLGA3N2R4,22,I was having sporadic problems with my old floppy drive .also a Teac. so. suspecting the problem was with the drive itself. rather than the motherboard. controller. cable. driver. etc.. I went ahead and bought this one from Amazon....  Well. it installed without a hitch. and now works flawlessly.  File transfers are somehow much. much faster  faster than with my drive at work. and especially compared to my old drive.  Funny that floppy drives dont carry X speed ratings like CDROMS  if they did this one might be an u0026quot8Xu0026quot.,4,1,541
A1LWYVLGA3N2R4,2526,Pros. low price. decent sound. unobtrusive. easy to set up.  Unlike some 3 or 5piece systems. the PC Works bass unit is shielded. in case you ever need to put it close to your monitor.Cons. though it seems a bit silly  to complain that a USD50 set of speakers offers less than perfect sound  reproduction  heck. Ive spent far more than that on speaker wire  the  u0026quotsubwooferu0026quot in this set is not really a subwoofer at all.  Its a  woofer. and exhibits a rather uneven frequency response.  Still. the sound  is fine for games and most Internet music content.As long as you  arent expecting them to sound like a good pair of living room speakers   dont believe the hype on the box  you probably wont be disappointed.,4,1,728
A1LX5SYITIHSLW,1011,I purchased this from an Ebay vendor for USD399. and received it three days later from Korea. Amazing. Well packed. everything was included. even a silly 240v120v prong adapter. I wasnt billed for any additional import fees. No problems with hookup and the monitor is working fine so far. I only docked one star because the antiglare coating on the screen is pretty poor. You really need to sit back some distance to avoid the strange distortions caused by the coating. I hate reflective screens. but if I had known about this coating in advance it might have chosen to get a version with a glass reflective screen.,4,1,615
A1LX9GSMN66L7E,11,I really like the ergo design. and this was a nice low price point for me to spend some time with an ergo keyboard. But the actual keys are kinda clunky  quite noisy. a bit hard to press. and not smooth acting.Also. I hadnt noticed .though see that its now clear in the photo on Amazon.com. that the wristpad is a solid. flat. plastic. integrated annoyance. It isnt comfortable. isnt paddable. and isnt removable  yuck!So. its worth the price. but thats about it. For comfort and satisfication. spend two or three times this price. which still isnt much.,3,0,554
A1LXSH5B0ELU0D,1010,Even though I put in the specific radio model we have. this is not the right antenna for it.  I failed to read the other reviews before I ordered it. we had the same problem some other reviewers stated.  The connection to the radio does not fit.  And there are no adaptors for it.  Even the review for the correct antenna said that it did not fit their radio.,2,0,359
A1LY7Z60TNV629,11,Works just like my shorter cables only with more optional length.  A good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to TV hookup when viewing pictures.,5,0,158
A1LYN3ZK230TGE,11,I just bought the Cobra Microtalk2 about a week ago and already. I am extremely impressed! The quality of the product is superb and the range is very good!Features on the radio include. Autosquelch. Autopower saver  feature. button beep confirmation. battery power level. Voice scramble.very  nice feature.. 14 channels and over 532 subchannels. a retractable antenna.  a backlight display. and a couple more features.The voice scrambling  feature is awesome on the radio. If you have a home scanner and listen to  the radio with the scramble ON. you could not tell what the radio is  saying. Anyways. very very nice radio all around. good for just about any  activity you want to do in fairly close proximity.The full range of the  radio is based primarily on lineofsight communication if you want to  reach the 2mile mark. This radio can reach a 2 mile mark. but again. only  if there isnt many obstacles in the way. However. I live in a very heavily  forested area and the microtalk2 reached up to 1.5 miles with slight  static.,5,1,1031
A1LYN3ZK230TGE,3232,Actually. I bought the RP2376 model. but it is pretty much the same.The player is really nice and has a good design. There arent a whole lot of features. but it does offer what you need including programability. 45 second antiskip. bass bootsurround sound. shuffle. repeat and your normal play. pause. stop. eject functions.The surround sound feature sounds nothing like surround sound in part from the stock headphones. These headphones have little to no treble. so it sounds like your listening to an old 1930s AM radio.If your looking to listen to some music and need a relatively inexpensive cd player. you found the one.,4,1,625

A1M16EVF7TL8V,0,I brought this 32gb sd card to upgrade the default 4gb sd card that came with the phone.121313.. Ive had this card in my coolpad quattro 4g smartphone. for about a month now. so far no problems what so ever...**UPDATE**  on .2514. this card died. became unrecognizable on all my devices. I had recently upgrade my phone from coolpad Quattro to a LG Optimus f3. .. so naturally i transferred the card to the new phone and less then a week later boom the card became unrecognizable. Fortunately i always backup all my data on my 4tb external drive. Very important people aways backup your data every time you add new data. or suffer the consequences.,3,0,648
A1M17ZTK354P6Y,0,The wall mount arrived in a timely manner.  I was a little hesitant about ordering this product after reading other reviews that was not very favorable.  I took a chance and ordered the wall mount .  I am using it with a Samsung 32  LCD LED Smart Tv and it works fine.  My husband had no problem with the installation and did it by himself.  When I arrived home it was hung and ready to go.  There is no sag and the unit is pretty heavy and solid.  I had to loosen some of the screws because they were to tight and I could not adjust the tv like I wanted to.  Other than that the tv wall mount is fine.  I dont know what experiences others had but for the price yipeeeeee!,4,1,672
A1M1P0Y1GIHMK4,0,i got it based on the a suggestion you know the products often purchased with. So I got it it said it  FITS MOST  19in36 inch tv. So not true. Well it was a BIG let down more because it was a Christmas gift the TV and wall mount was going to be up Christmas morning oh joy....But no the stupid mount didnt fit the TV. So I have the TV still sitting in the box and told the kids that Santa will have to send us the extension parts via UPS. Not Cool at.,2,0,451
A1M2RJNIHB2RQJ,1,caused a static noise. but after adjusting the bass and treble nobs on the cars stereo. the noise diminished a bit. noise still heard. but nothing too annoying.,4,1,160
A1M31HB05OCA8X,0,I installed these in my garage and am very pleased with the sound and clarity.  A salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them. but for USD30.00. you just cant beat these speakers.  They are easy to set up.  Anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage. patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with them.,4,1,363
A1M3YRGMZ9PPDS,0,Bought 2 one worked for 1 min the other lasted almost 2 monthsand cant return wont buy from amazon again they sell JUNK,1,0,119
A1M40ZIRNW4AX2,22,I love the software and the finished product looks great. I rated it down for userfriendliness. Memorex has the greatest helpline. though. if you get stuck. After talking to 4 people over 3 days. I finally got it right. The arrow for the feed into the printer is upside down .at least thats the way it is for my printer.. I thought the jewel case backs lacked perforation and didnt understand why Id need to use a paper cutter but as it turned out. it was perfect when I turned the page around. The helpline folks helped me calibrate my printer. My design was off just a littleI needed to move it a few millimeters to the left and down. I recommend telephoning for help if you cant figure something out. They are very patient and very versed in the software. There is an extensive help menu. but I found that confusing.,4,1,819
A1M4UW768SKVAF,44,broke really fast  during my trip and ended up having to buy a new one.  Tried to use it when I got back .purchased an electronic in England while I was there. and the US portion would not work either.  Going to just throw it away.  The ones I purchased in the UK were cheaper and better quality. anyways.,2,0,305
A1M5ACJ0SQNZGO,0,I would not pay USD14.99 plus shipping .especially when I qualified for free shipping. for this cheaply made book light. I feel its not worth the money and it looks like it should be a give away..........I was also told the approximately USD4.00 I had left on my gift certificate would be applied to my purchases. It wasnt. and I have no idea how to retrieve it.,1,0,362
A1M5D0DG09UGVM,1,I love my USD25 Brother label maker.  The first day I was busy for hours until I ran out of tape.  I wouldnt have chosen this color if it wasnt the cheapest one sold through Amazon.grb,3,0,184
A1M5IWLZF5Z53P,23,The unit that was sent to me does not power on. I searched on the Internet and a lot of other people have the same issue. It seems there is a problem with the batteries on these units.... They are supposed to last for a long time. but mine did not even power on once. It would be nice for the end user to be able to take the battery out and replace it I am going to have to send mine back. even though I had to wait a while to get this one and was looking forward to use it. play with it. test it. Ok. so I sent this one back and got the money back. but not the cost to send it back to seller. I bought a second one from another seller. This one powered on. but had other serious issue with it. I tried to insert a micro SD card. but the casing for the card reader was misaligned and my card fell in the device itself. As this could have been labeled as my fault. that I did not pay enough attention to the casing. I did not try to send it back. Plus. I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader. but instead I managed to break it entirely. The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely. I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device. but without damaging some places of the plastic cover. I figured that 2GB of internal memory would be enough and I would be loading books on it through the USB connector. by connecting to a computer. But it turns out it does not have 2GB available internally to put books on. It only has 250 MB. like other reviewers have mentioned. I do not know if I can root the device without a card reader to put a card in. Have not tried to root it yet. but I read on the internet that it is possible. That would be the obvious solution to many of its software limitations. I went ahead and bought a third device because I really want a book reader with an EInk screen that has a card reader and that one seems fine. but I did not played with it much.,1,0,2073
A1M6FE68HVMTK4,11,The Nook is an excellent ereader.If you prefer buttons or. simply do not like a touch screen. stop reading right now. and go buy yourself a kindle. If you are like me. and find buttons meddlesome. then the Nook is the ebook for you. There are a few cons with the nook though.There is a long delay when trying to do a lot of things on the NookThe nook feels a bit chunky in your handsThe touch screen can sometimes be unresponsive.Aside from these flaws. the nook has some promising features. Such as.Very easy set upPolished lookThere is a convienient reading now button. that takes you back to the book that you were recently readingYou can lend books to friendsYou can download books from your local library.In conclusion. the Nook is not perfect. But. over all it is a very good ereader to chose.,4,1,799
A1M6X8CH3J2K4J,0,Wow. what a frustrating product. The technology is so tantalizing. but the realization through the Rio 500 is so bugridden that it drove me crazy.  I  am returning the product.  Some of the problems.o The software from  Diamond or from Audible to program the Rio is truly horrid. the worst  software Ive seen in many years.  It crashes so frequently that you will  be pulling your hair out.o The documentation is a joke! The  u0026quotmanualu0026quot is two pages long. And no. the product isnt intuitive  so you dont need a manual. Look forward to lots of trial and error as you  learn it yourself.Actually. the hardware part is OK and the sound is  joyous on those rare occasions when you can get it programmed. But for me.  the trouble overwhelms the joy.  Ill be returning mine and looking at a  Creative Nomad or some nextgeneration MP3 player.,1,0,849
A1M7HM3P4NRLHA,710,I have been using these little babies for the last couple of years...and  they perform as well as 3COM 905s. fraction of the cost.Im a  Systemsnetwork Admin typehardware. software.etc.  I do most of it.I  have yet to run into problems I could peg on the card.  Ive run it under  WinNT Server and Workstation 4.0. Win 2000 Pro. Windows 9x. and Linux.  For  a brief time. bad drivers were shipped with them. but Netgear corrected  it.These little babies are dual mode .10100 speed. and Full Duplex  .this is a good thing for you nongeeks out there..The naysayers are  blaming the wrong part of their PC with the criticisms Ive read so far.  Ive run them in everything from Pentium Class TX motherboards up to PIII  BX boards.  No problems.Buy it. youll like it.,5,1,759
A1M8AKSWFB9RX9,1921,I now have my third G2000A. the first two having been returned under warranty.  All three have .had.horrible AM sections which display considerable static on all but local a 50.000 watt station.  Extremely disappointing and not worth purchasing.,1,0,245
A1M8J5Z9V22BGY,2424,Midland has always made quality products and this handheld CB is a nice little unit.

A1M8QFBIN85XW4,0,The worst product I have ever used.  The nook has for the second time deleted an expensive university text. This was not user error.  Google the issue.

A1M9126YPQPS3L,4,These speakers do not sound bad. dont get me wrong.  If the company had actually used a tad more thought when designing the cabling they would have a winner.  However. even the sound quality on these is not up to par with the set of Cambridge SoundworksCreative Labs computer speakers I have that cost about the same price.The subwoofer seems fine. but the satellites seem to have a much cheaper tinnier sound than the Creative Labs Speakers.  For gaming they sound fine. but music clearly sounds better on the Creative Labs speakers to me.But where these speakers truly fail the end user is in the wiring.  Unlike the Creative Labs set that is configured more like a standard set of stereo speakers. allowing you to position your satellites anywhere in the room to achieve optimal separation. the Altec Lansing set has very short cables.  The left speaker has to be within four feet of the subwoofer.  Then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left.  Then to add insult to injury. the five foot wire from the computer to the speaker system has to plug into the left speaker.Worst of all. they hardwire everything.  On the Creative labs system. the computer connects to the subwoofer which connects via standard speaker cable to the satellites.  Wonderful and simple design!!  The Altec Lansings have wires of nonstandard configuration hardwired into the left speaker and chincy speaker wire that is hardwired between the speakers .Maybe if you rip them apart and splice wires you could expand it. but do you want to?..The easy configuration of your computer speaker system is a large percentage of its sound and convenience.  Dump these babies for the better sounding Creative Labs setup.,1,0,1703

A1MA0AS18PPABP,11,I have had experience in both the Palm and Pocket PC fields. owning a Palm Vx and HP Jornada 525. This Jornada 680 is a REMARKABLE machine. The Windows CE is very similar to the normal Windows.One important thing to think about before buying. Do you want to spend about USD600700 on a new one or spend about USD250 for a new and used one on ebay.com? I bought mine there NEW for USD260!The display is wonderful. even though 256 colors. The keyboard eventhough small has many standard features of a normal keyboard. For normal typing. it is not to great. but for touch typing its great. It has a CompactFlash slot and PC card slot for LAN. etc. It has a 56k modem which is a real rocket.I have given 4 stars for the small keyboard. which is not a real problem. A MUST for busy people!,4,1,783
A1MASM2C2VL2R,78,I have this slot in my Canon 60D which states it is for a HDMI cable that can be hooked up to a HDTV.  It is supposed to provide a sharper picture so I thought I would get one.

A1MC4013WKDABW,11,The radio works as advertised and I enjoy it very much.  The main reason I ordered it was because you can use it as a portable radio and as an inauto cb.

The seller accepted the return of this product without any problems and provided a refund quickly..,2,0,426
A1MCFC8BXNAWO,0,While reading books on the nook is a pleasant experience. finding them is not.  For one thing. some magazine subscriptions do not work on the Nook Color. But they do not warn you of this fact.  The happily charge your credit card and allow you to believe that next Monday you can download the latest copy of The New Yorker.  What you get. however is an error message that tells you to try again later.  Finally. after several days. you must call. wait on hold. and to to customer service. etc.Another problem is the search function on the Bu0026N website.  Their engine is not nearly as intuitive as this one.  I actually use Amazon for all of my searches and then write down specific info so I can find the same thing over there.  If they even have it.  I wanted to buy a book about the Columbine school shootings. so I searched for books here and found what I wanted .available on Kindle. too!.. but the same book is not available over there.Nook Color is a colossal waste of money for me. Beware.,3,0,999

A1MDRMX9BLKLPU,33,This is the second Nook I have purchased from Hudson.  They both developed problems after just a couple of months.

I will never buy anything from Hudson again because they do not care if they sell defective items!,1,0,365
A1MDZD02NEV6IG,12,My first experiences with AGFA cameras were inexpensive. cheaplymade. but functional cameras. The ePhoto SMILE is not an exception.The fact that you can get a camera with a resolution of 640x480 with this many features  for this cheap is quite amazing. However. before you start reaching for  your credit card. remember a few things.1. 640x480 is great. but the  compression algorithm .makes the picture smaller in size  this does have  an affect on quality. leaves much to be desired. You dont get really clean  640x480 pics out of here2. If you are going to be using this camera to  take pics of items to sell on eBay or other auction sites. or just to toss  up on your homepage. this camera does quite nicely.3. If you are trying  to sell a product and want the photo to look professional. this is not the  camera for you. check out a camera with an LCD display on the back and that  does at LEAST 1024x768.4. This thing eats batteries. Guess what. so do  all digital cameras. Especially those with an LCD display on the back .this  one doesnt..5. It comes with everything you need to get started   camera. software. computer cables. carrying case. etc. You dont have to go  out and buy anything else just to get started.Overall. not a bad camera  for the price. but if you want a high quality camera. you need to expect to  spend USD200USD300 at the bare minimum.,3,0,1367

A1MF10ZZDL36SE,0,Well you get what you pay for. I use these cables to listen to my iPod in the car. But the connection is so flimsy that the cables the connectors have to be placed perfectly. If one of them is slightly bentoff. Ill lose my stereo effect and the music will only come out of one speaker. You have to jiggle it around a bit to get it to function properly. and even then its only until you make a too sharp turn or go over a speed bump too quickly. and then you have to jiggle it again to get it right again.If you can stand messing around with your cables to get them to work. theyre great. Otherwise. spend more money on higher quality cables.,2,0,641
A1MGNQGS99DYUI,0,I bought my notebook computer three years ago and immediately purchased the Kensington Microsaver.  Why? .. because its just too darn easy for someone snatch several thousands of dollars of computer off of a desk top  and be gone in two seconds.  Its that simple.  Ive developed a habit of  locking down when I am at a job site. leaving the hotel room and I even  lock it down to the rail underneath the car seat .why not?.. My friend just  purchased an expensive fully loaded notebook computer and I want to get him  a microsaver... so Im ordering one from Amazon.com,5,1,568
A1MH6WD3MPEOG2,1921,I give the Rio 5 stars in spite of some flaws. It is a new product. yet when compared to its unique features gets a high rating from me. I do use the RIO for music when walking. etc. However I have found it very valuable  to me as an education cram machine. I bought a series of videos on SQL7  Database certification. Most of the instruction is audio .90%. which lends  itself to the RIO audio player. What I do is digitally record each chapter  as a .WAV file about 10 to 18 minutes each. I use soundforge software. I  normalize to 10db. Then noisefilter the gaps for silence. I then do a time  compression of about 30% this seems to work the best. then convert the  .WAV to .MP3 at 32 bits mono. This is about the lowest bitrate before it  sounds like Darth Vader. I am getting about a 110 file size reduction and  30% time reduction before loading to the RIO. I can load 4 hours of clean.  clear voice instructions in one package. I play it when I walk. in my car  and other free listening time. Great educational aid!,5,1,1022
A1MHZHYE05NXCP,1316,I bought 2 boxes of them and whenever I want to replay them .they are not doing it. lots of continues streaks and fast forwards during the run. I had to trow them out !!!And I ordered different namebrands.but if you like to see some  I can send you a few.,1,0,255

A1MI94V2UD7AAW,0,Great way to have all your chargers or plugs fit into one power  strip .  Design allows for all but the largest chargers to fit side by side .a few might not..

A1MIS022T4YM4J,0,I used this lock for about six months before finally tossing it. It occasionally got stuck but I was always able to jiggle it open eventually .after about 5 minutes.. Finally last week it got stuck and no amount of jiggling was able to unstick it. Finally forced it open by using pliers to force the button down .the combination was right the whole time. after a few days of carrying around the whole cable. Not a good lock if you want something dependable.,1,0,457
A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,11,This is one great trackball. The product I bought is actually the Cordless version of the FX Trackball. but its basically the same as this one except for the cordlesswireless feature. The ergonomics are a little different also but its basically the same trackball device.You cant beat the smoothness of this trackball. Ive seen lots of them over the years but none ever impressed me enough to buy one until now. Now that Ive tried one Im a convert. The action is extremely smooth once you adapt a little to the finger movements to move the ball. Also. getting used to the placement of the four different buttons takes a little time. But once this is accomplished the ability to move smoothly and quickly around your computer screen is vastly improved over a typical mouse.The buttons are all configurable as to function. but Ive found sticking with the default settings during the software setup is the best way to go. There is one thing I am trying to see how it works out. I reconfigured button 4 as the delete key. This is sort of convenient because it allows you to browse and delete files just with the  trackball instead of having to use the other hand to hit the delete key on the keyboard after highlighting a file with the trackball. Pretty convenient for those occasional cleanup tasks on your hard disk.Another thing I have found useful is to use medium instead of low acceleration. which allows you to shoot all the way across the screen by moving the trackball maybe an inch and a half or so. but then to drop the overall sensitivity down a bit. The default setting for trackball sensitivity is right in the middle of the range on the slider adjustment bar. I drop it down one more tack on the slider bar. This assists in hitting all those small buttons when using high resolution on your monitor. The medium acceleration gets you there faster but then you have more control once youre there to zero in on the button. Try it and see if you like this better than the default settings. You will find these settings by opening up the Trackball program menu. clicking on u0026quotmouse properties.u0026quot and then on the u0026quotmotionu0026quot tab.One last thing I do to customize the operation of the trackball is you can check a box that causes the cursor to jump to the highlighted button of a new dialog box. I find this useful also.I noted a very interesting new feature. One of the buttons when clicked pops up the u0026quotWebwheel.u0026quot This is a wheel with 10 different pieshaped pieces which are configurable as web addresses or for other webrelated functions. such as go back. reload. go to favoritesbookmarks. and so on. When you hit this button. the wheel comes up. and you basically have a second menu to choose selection from. Pretty cool.I should mention the software install is a little nonintuitive. The instructions say to disconnect your mouse and plug in the new trackball .with the power off.. However. when you boot the machine. Windows 98 sees the now missing mouse and wants to autodetect your hardware again and recreate the entire driver database. Not knowing what would happen I just cancelled out of this screen and let the computer boot up normally but without any mouse function. I then loaded the software. using the tab key to navigate around to configure everything. which wasnt too hard. and after you are finished it asks do you want to reboot. and after that the trackball works normally.Although not cheap. all in all a fine product that is worth the money.,4,1,3512
A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,1011,I did a previous review on this case. which I liked. and just wanted to clear up a misconception I read by another reviewer.He said the case doesnt offer that much protection because its just plastic with an aluminum finish. No. The case has real aluminum bonded to plastic. because one of the occasional problems Ive heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plastic.Aside from the occasional problem like that. I found this to be quality case. Although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it. its worth it as it costs USD100 to get the glass screen replaced by Palm if it breaks.,4,1,646
A1MMEARDASNIA0,11,This is definitely the way to go if you want to keep an officecomputer and home computer in sync. Just get the extra cradle and use your Palm as the gobetween. Amazon definitely has the best price Ive found on this  most places sell at retail.,4,1,243

A1MOIMSIK8JSYW,1,I bought this CB radio about two months ago.  i am a CB enthusiast and have been through many radios. i must say that this handheld radio is absolutely the best bet for anyone who is going on a trip or just want to  have some fun. it his high powered and unbelievable features for its price.  the PTT button or .push to talk button. on it is very nice you dont need  much force to push it in and it clicks so u know you are transmitting.  The  weather radio is nice receives very nicely and for a handheld it gets out  pretty far and if you buy an external antenna. u can add at least another 2  miles to the range of this radio. I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT!,5,1,650

A1MVFDBFYO0HTE,0,I have used this nearly every day for about 18 months at work. on the road. at parks and sometimes at home to secure my laptop.  It has worked well for me. I have had no trouble with the combination changing as others on Amazon report.  It can be a little sensitive to go off while you are typing. so you want the cable to be fairly loose between the laptop and alarm so vibrations arent transferred through the cable. But I dont consider this a problem.  My company accepts this as an alternative to physically securing .anchoring. the laptop to a piece of furniture which is often impractical when on the road or in many other situations.  The cable is not long enough to physically anchor in most cases so you have to trust the alarm mechanism. but it works very well. The rubberplastic cover for the Activate motion alarm button cracked but the button still works fine.If your company requires you to secure your laptop from theft at all times this is a more practical approach than trying to find physical anchor spots in meeting rooms. hotels. outdoors etc. See if your IT group will approve this device.  It makes laptop physical security a lot easier and therefore more likely to be followed consistently.,4,1,1213

A1MW6W6E481PW5,0,originally. I wrote.So far so good with this SD card. I bought this for my wifes Samsung Intensity II. It seems that Verizon has blocked the easy USB access to the internal memory card. I used to easily connect and transfer pics that we took with the phone.This product was easy to use. I reformatted to FAT32. then inserted into her phone. I moved all the pics to her card. and then used the included PC SD card adaptor to load the cards onto my netbook.update.Functionally. this card is good. Seems to take forever to move files from teh phone to the card. but that could be an issue with the phone.However. after much troubleshooting of battery issues with the phone. I realized that this card was causing the phone battery to drain in a remarkable speed.If you purchase this card. you will have to use it as we do. just as a media to remove files from the phone and transfer to the pc. If you keep this card in your phone. it will drain your battery!,2,0,954

A1MYO26LV8X7JI,67,I bought the Nook last week. its always a joyous experience to buy something from a store. activation was easy on the device. took some time to create new account on Barnes and noble site. but I was ready to go in 15 minutes.I purchased one book and started reading immediately. after 4 days. suddenly the eink screen went darker. The device comes with one year warranty. I took it to the store and they replaced it in 5 minutes. again. the store experience was great.Pros.1 The device look and feel is good. design is sleek and smooth.2 Touch screen is a good idea. I have tendinitis so I prefer to use touch screen over keyboard.3 The page turn keys are in good place. very comfortable to read and hold at the same time.4 Found many books on the library search. it has detailed editorial and user reviews. with ratings. just like Amazon site.5 The format is not proprietary. this was a huge sale point for me. there are other devices that can read the same format.6 Battery is replaceable and memory SD slot is available.Cons.1 The touch screen is sluggish. you need to use it slower than using other touch devices. this is either buggy hardware or CPU is too slow.2 First device I got was defective. not a good sign. hopefully the second one is better.3 Browsing the web is ok. but using the small touch screen to navigate through HTML is not an easy task. especially since it is sluggish.4 Not all books are available in the online library. I found a psychology book in the store that did not exist for download.5 You need to use screw driver to open the back cover and replace battery or insert SD card.6 Little bit heavy. certainly heavier than a medium size hard cover book.,4,1,1681

A1N1GDSDLHLJO,14,The camera bag smelled like cigaret ashes and it looked very old and used but it works good tho ..,1,0,98
A1N3BKGQDMZ8ZU,0,Had to return this item as it did not load properly.  Only able to view the default issue.  Was unable to open any other articles. pictorials. etc.,1,0,147
A1N3DFHTSVCORA,22,I wouldnt waste my time on this product.  The range isnt nearly what was advertised.  It says 150 feet. but I can barely get them to work across the room.  Its even worse in a twostory house.  God forbid if you want to have the transmitter downstairs and the speaker upstairs or outside.  They are prone to hissing and popping and my set has an annoying. highpitched whine.  Even the slight motion can interfere with the signal. I should have returned them when I had the chance.,1,0,479
A1N3EH28S4DI8L,0,Works just like it should. Serves as a great way to get proper white balance. Just place in front of lens. depress shutter button to focus and light meter. then remove and shoot. Images look much better now.,4,1,207
A1N3SPXXZQT0ZV,0,I gave this unit 4 stars because it is a reasonable value for the price .unlike the RVB99BK..  I modified the unit so I could play my bass through it while playing CDs.  Due to the digital design. the modification was not  trivial.  Construction is mostly plastic. with a number of computerstyle  circuit boards connected with fragile ribbon cables.  Not as rugged as I  would expect.  The CD and tape are not all that well protected against  dust.  The CD player is VERY sensitive to jarring it will skip if you walk  with it.  Instead of a conventional crossover. they place steel weights on  the woofers.  Novel.  The bass is strong enough for me to use as a bass amp  when playing with several acoustic guitars.  .Positive comments from  listeners..  The electronics features .via remote. are impressive. and the  FM tuner works well AM is less impressive.,4,1,860
A1N5D3CDF6P8PX,1517,It is extremely comfortable and actually fun to use.  It would be the perfect input device if it only had a mousewheel.  The button replacement is not nearly as good. but this is true on any device that tries to replace the wheel with a button.,4,1,244
A1N5YQG97VX7XM,22,Used out doors for hands free operation.  Good quailty sound and construction.  I expect Ill get years of use from them.  These are a good buy.,4,0,143
A1N61YO8HAAZ44,13,Im the kind of person who leaves batteries in a charger andforgets about them till I need them. I think most people are likethat. The worst feature of this product is you cannot leave the batteries in it for more than 48 hours without damaging them! Im sorry but Ive got other things to worry about besides checking batteries charge status.The u0026quotUniversal Battery Charger .23419.u0026quot can do 4. and is half the cost of the Olympus. The u0026quotRechargeable Battery Fast Charger .23422.u0026quot can do 8. which. considering the way the D340R eats batteries. you might want. It is almost the price of this model here. but with twice the capacity. Neither come with NiMH batteries.After returning the Olympus charger. I got the size 8 one and it works fine. The batteries are sold separately but you will still come out ahead.Do yourselves a favor. skip this one,2,0,872
A1N61YO8HAAZ44,8586,You need this if you have a camera that uses SmartMedia. For transferring images to your computer. its way faster than using the cable. It took me about 5 minutes to install the software. Theres a helpful picture on the  adapter to show you how to correctly insert the SmartMedia card. After  that. the whole thing is transparent. the adapter mounts as if it were a  floppy drive on your desktop.Make sure you move the images from the  floppy to your hard drive before opening them because the hard drive is  much faster. If you want to clear space on your SmartMedia card after  moving the photos. you just delete them as if they were regular files. It  uses two CR2016 lithium coin batteries some people say these run out  quickly. but I havent had any problems. Do a search on Amazon for  u0026quotCR2016u0026quot under u0026quotAll Productsu0026quot and youll find a wide  selection. The adapter will power down after some idle period to save  battery life  you power it back up by ejecting and reinserting the  adapter.Be aware. the adapter does NOT recognize write protection on  SmartMedia cards. This is not a real problem but just something to keep in  mind.The whole thing is so easy and also kind of fun! Dont own a  SmartMedia digital camera without one.,5,1,1266
A1N61YO8HAAZ44,5153,Theres a reason why this camera is the most popular one on the site  it is all you will ever need in a digital camera. at an unbeatable price! I understood ZERO about digital photography and had it up and running in no  time. Make sure you get the following accessories..1. A floppy adaptor.  because moving pictures to your computer by cable is too slow..2. A  16MB memory cartridge because you will not be able to stop taking  pictures..3. Extra rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger because the  one minor drawback of this baby is the way it eats batteries for  breakfast.I cannot say enough good things about this camera. If youre  just looking for a camera to record your friends. family. and life. this is  the one.,5,1,725
A1N63K8FHO3AML,1618,It is slow and glitches for me. And I could not figure out how to put on the  Free 1.000 Ebooks  that it supposedly came with. Watch their wording with this one. I did receive 1.000 books but they were already free on the Nook. I paid the extra money to get something free. I will NEVER order from this person again. I did not appreciate the misleading words. I will continue to use and purchase my Nook products but not from this seller again,1,0,443
A1N6VVVSEEPWIL,1,Great set of small speakers. which I bought for being simple travel speakers. and for the price they are incredible.The sound quality is better than many cheap radios. Although it does suffer from a lack of bass this is more than acceptable as the treble is crisp and clear.Again. for the price it is incredible buy. I would recommend them to anyone.,5,1,350
A1N6Y12BLR43BM,12,After using it in my CD player it wouldnt even finish cleaning it. So therefore its not playing other CDS. I would not invest my money if I were you.,1,0,149
A1N7GVGLTV5NJ7,3,Decided upon the NOOK tablet over the Kindle fire.  Happy with the choice so far.  The 32 gig memory gives lots of possibilties.  The reader works well.  Using mostly for free audio books downloaded from LIBRIVOX.ORG.,5,1,217
A1N7OU7YBSJU24,33,During hollidays. spent under the bright sun with my iPad as a reading device. I was jealously looking at the people using proper ebook readers. Searching for the best matching one. Ive found 2 interesting. Barnes u0026 Noble Nook Touch and Kobo Touch. My decision was based on the pageturning knobs implemented in the shell. which were lacking in Kobo device. Im quite happy with Nook Touch. allthough dont really understand the politics behind the sale of the electronic books outside of North America. Its simply impossible to buy smething from NB. not having an adress in States or Canada. DRM coded books can be readed. but without the cover image  probably software issue. Few times. while pressing over the word. which of course highlighted the marking .without choosing any options. it went out of response from the touch screen. The only solution was. either to plug the USB cable. or wait until the device can be accessed  meaning at least one hour.Well. as a gift for my doughter. Nook Touch is perfect. small. light and stylish. For me. Im gonna wait for an Amazon Kindle Touch device with a Pearl eink matrix.,4,1,1122
A1N7Q1NR7ELYCY,2,For me. the Nook was not a good product.  Use caution if you choose to buy one.  FIND OUT HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO RETURN IT FOR A FULL REFUND. so that you can get your money back if its defective.Jumbled Texts.  The first thing I purchased for my Nook was a newspaper.  Unfortunately. the articles were jumbled one with the other. so that they didnt make sense.  Confused. I took it into the Bu0026N store.  The salesman said. yes this sometimes happens.  He didnt even seem particularly surprised.  I asked for a refund. He said. there are no refunds for jumbled texts.  Ah.Battery.  I found that when I charged the battery. it lost power quickly. even when not in use.  I took it in.  The salesman kindly tested it for me. and said there is nothing wrong.  That was kind of him. but it didnt solve the problem.So I gave my Nook away and bought a Kindle. and have been happy ever since.  The staff at the Barnes and Noble bookstore are very friendly. but the company policy of how product problems are handled does not offer the customer refunds for defects and it seems that defects are the norm.Imagine charging for a newspaper with jumbled text???  I dont know what was going on with the battery perhaps the battery problem was user error?  If so. the product isnt very userfriendly.  I had no such problems with the Kindle.  No jumbled texts. and no batteries that discharge when the product isnt in use.Foreign Languages.  A third advantage to the Kindle is wide access to documents in other languages. both books and periodicals.  For example. you can purchase a SpanishEnglish dictionary for your Kindle. then purchase a Madrid newspaper in Spanish.  Point to a word. and up pops the definition in Spanish and English.  Splendid!,1,0,1734
A1N85NGWKHCEK6,23,The number 1 reason this is terrible? The design for going over your ear is just plain stupid. It doesnt stay on. It more or less dangles on your ear and if you bend over or tilt your head it basically falls off. Maybe if you have huge ears this MIGHT stay on. but who knows. I didnt test the sound quality because honestly. if it doesnt stay on your ear then who care how superb the quality is.,1,0,395
A1N8HDVGGZENV5,0,I wanted a microphone which would work with voice recognition software.  The advertising said that this microphone was. u0026quotideal for voice recording. voice recognition software or telephony over the internet.u0026quot  Ideal is not the word Id use.I tested the microphone with the voice  recognition software.  It came back with a below average rating and a  warning that the voice recognition software might not work well with  it.In many cases. low quality voice recognition is worse than no voice  recognition at all.  Often Ill have to undo what the computer thought I  told it to do.  They say that a computer only does what you tell it to do.  If the microphone does not clearly hear what you are saying. it will take a  guess.The bottom line is that for voice recognition. a higher quality  microphone is needed.  In a pinch if your keyboard and mouse were  inoperative you might be able to make the voice recognition software work  using this microphone.  Personally Id just turn off the computer.,3,0,1011
A1N8HZA6TPK97P,3639,We have had the LD50 for over a month now. and it works great! The video is what one would expect on DVD. The audio is a bit tinny through the small speakers. but otherwise OK. Through headphones. the sound is CDquality.  The player accompanies us on both plane and car trips.,5,1,276
A1N9BYQWV16CSG,1821,I have been trying to contact Belkin about this product.  I have one that I used for a few years. and when I pulled the plug out. the plastic housing cracked apart. leaving exposed wires and the electrical prongs firmly embedded in the live electrical outlet.  I had to go to our breaker box and shut down power to the outlets. then used a screwdriver to pry the exposed plug from the wall outlet.  REALLY poor material use. made in China with out safety standards.  Boo to this company.,1,0,487
A1N9HGBEH1KLVW,55,I purchased the EHP1000 in January of 2002 at the cost of USD25 plus shipping. from a different online vendor.  The unit performed nicely for a long time.  However. at one point it just quit.  Being mechanically and electronically able. I disassembled the unit. There is a ribbon cable that connects both sides of the headphones.  This ribbon cable had several razor cuts through the insulation. just deep enough to prevent the conductors from being severed. It was obvious this was done intentionally by the person who assembled the unit.The cable flexes internally when the headset is adjusted for different head sizes.  Over time. the headset adjusting. flexed the cable internally and the wires eventually broke. I was able to replace the wires and make the unit work. but note that this unit was mechanically NEVER designed to be repaired.  The ear pads thin plastic coating will flake over time. The battery replacement is aggravating units by other manufacturers have outside access battery compartments making replacement easier.  I got my use out of this unit.  For the cost. it paid its own way. Would I buy another?  Not since I know there are other low cost units out there. easier with which to work.,2,0,1213
A1N9QUJASE2N76,0,I love the digital music channels provided through my cable TV service. and I wanted to be able to listen to this music outside. I just got so sick of dragging the boom box outside during dinner parties or while gardening and then having to fuss with changing CDsespecially when I had great music playing inside the house.The speaker has exceeded my expectations. If you read the directions carefully and follow them stepbystep. youll have good sound outdoors. too. I was up and running with tunes oustide within ten minutes. I needed another five minutes to fine tune. which was easily accomplished by reading the instructions and the troubleshooting guide. .If you refuse to read instructions or to show a little patience. you get what you deserve..Contrary to what you may have read in other reviews. if the unit is set up correctly. the sound is NOT thin. The bass is substantial and even with the volume set to maximum. there is no distortion. I set up the speaker .loud!. and strolled my entire yard perimeter. as well as the far side of my neighbors yard. and could hear everything perfectly. I used the cordless phone right next to the unitno problem. The distance from my stereo to the backyard is the entire depth of the houseabout 60 feetwith signal passing through several plaster and brick walls. I found that its important to place the transmitter up as high as you can. That solved the few little sound problems I had at setup. What can I say? It sounds great and I love it.,5,1,1489
A1N9U2ACOM3UQ6,7882,Many people are busting on this player.  Ive only had mine for 1 week. and its been flawless.  I offer 2 ideas about it. 1. players made back in q3 of 1999 might be a different batch than those available now.  So. some  improvements may be available now that were not in this model last year. 2.  this player has a RF adapter. so that you can play it directly into an  analog tv.  I bought the converter at a local store. and it works great.  So. now. I dont need to buy a new T.V.I hope it keeps working this  well. but for saving me the need to buy a new T.V.. there was a significant  hidden savings in this player.  Its the only one I could find that had  this feature.It played the Matrix. etc. without a hitch this weekend.,4,1,729
A1N9V2Y5ERIR4S,0,Well.  my father won a gift certificate for 500 dollars. and instead of getting a digital camera he got a mider saw and this cd player for me for christmas. It has some minor flaws. to wide. the buttons are in a bad spot.  no hold button. cover moves a bit. causing it to stop. anti skip starts up  no matter what. which makes you wait...and it drains your batteris. but its  ok. my xgirl friend dropped it. and i watched it shatter. so i guess i get  USD50 outa the whole deal,1,0,477

A1NCK1OV50VO4Q,0,My only concern that I havent resolved is that they seem to fall out of Palm IIIxe models too easily. but I havent figured out whether its the IIIxe or the styli that have a compatability problem.  May want to check it if youve got a Palm IIIxe.,4,1,245
A1NCMP9H9BCJF5,0,I like it because it works like I hoped and wanted it to. I wasnt sure where else to go to find a zip drive so I can use my zip discs. My old computer with a built in zip drive quit working. A friend suggested Amazon and he was right. I wasnt sure what I would get on the internet. It looks new and performs like I hoped it would. Right now I am very happy with Amazon.com.,5,1,373
A1NCWM4LO568L8,22,This item just isnt a good idea. I know its cheap. but rremember that you get what you pay for. It doesnt give a constant charge to my device. Its as if my G.P.S. just doesnt like the charger at all or vice versa. Just a terrible decision on my part I guess. Hold out for the proper wall charger.,1,0,296

A1NEO06KPX4VCC,13,If you dont want to spend all that money on the slimmer. sleeker Palm V. and you know you dont want a WinCE device. then the IIIx is the way to go.The IIIx has the same screen technology and processor as the IIIe.  but twice as much memory. Some users have reported u0026quotstreakingu0026quot  problems on the screen. I have not experienced that. In most cases. my  screen is very clear and readable.However. Palm recently introduced the  u0026quotreverse backlightingu0026quot feature that inverts the color when you  turn it on. Its great when youre sitting in very dark conditions. but in  dimly lit rooms or during twilight outside. it can be quite difficult to  read the screen because of the reverse backlighting. I learned. though.  that there is a simple Graffiti shortcut to make the backlight  u0026quotnormalu0026quot. Even with the normal backlighting. I had trouble  reading the screen in twilight conditions.Another feature of the IIIx  that the IIIe lacks is an upgradeable operating system. This was the  deciding factor for me when I chose the IIIx over the IIIe. The current  PalmOS is 3.3. but the IIIe was shipping with 3.1 when I bought the unit  for a friend for Christmas. The IIIx also had 3.1. but I immediately  upgraded it to 3.3. There is no way to do that on the IIIe.You may ask.  Why would I need OS 3.3 instead of 3.1? Heres one reason. HotSyncing via  infrared. OS 3.1 cant do it. If youre a laptop user and dont feel like  carrying your HotSync cradle everywhere. or springing the extra money for a  USB cable. then IR is a great feature. Its slower than the cradle. but way  more convenient.The IIIx also has an internal expansion slot that the  IIIe lacks. Supposedly. you can open up your IIIx and plug devices like  pager cards. etc.. into it. but I dont think many of these devices exist  right now. It wasnt a deciding factor for me.Many people .including  myself. have wondered. Why get a Palm IIIx instead of a Handspring Visor  Deluxe? Heres is my reason. that I dont see many people mentioning. like  the IIIe. the OS in the current Handsprings CANNOT be upgraded. That means  if it ships with OS3.1. you are stuck with it.If upgrading your OS is  important to you. you should not get a current model of the Visor. .Perhaps  in the future. their models will be upgradeable..The other reason I  chose the IIIx over the Handspring was that Handspring was experiencing 6  week delays. I know that another reviewer has said he got his in 2.5 weeks.  but if Handsprings own website is saying u0026quotIts going to be 6  weeks.u0026quot then you pretty much have to take it at face value. I just  checked their site as I write this. and it says their wait is down to four  weeks. If you can wait that long and dont need an upgradeable version.  then I would take a hard look at the Visor. It has a lot of attractive  features. Remember that Visors ship with a USB cradle. If you dont have  USB support on your computer. youll have to purchase a serial cradle for  .I think. USD10.As far as cost goes on the IIIx. shop around a little if  youre costconscious.To sum up. get the IIIx if..a. You cant  afforddont need the slimness of the V or Vx .b. Need the extra memory  compared to the V or IIIe .c. Need the upgradeable OS or IR HotSync .d.  Cant wait the possible 4 weeks for the Visor.Hope this info is useful.,4,1,3352
A1NFJNKDVHUB4H,1311,I own three of these  one for each computer I regularly use.  They last forever. and never even need cleaning as they never get jumpy.  There is never any slippage. so it works much better than a ballbased mouse for  things like Quake where you may want to make fast but precise  movements.There are four buttons which can be programmed to do whatever  you want.  For example. I set one of the extra buttons to be the back  button in my web browser.  Now I can move through web sites onehanded  without having to move the pointed up over the back button constantly.  This also allowed me to switch my IE toolbar to use small icons with no  text labels. freeing up screen space.The only possible suggestion I can  come up with is that it would be nice if they added on a scrollwheel like  all the new mice seem to have.Ill never go back to using regular mice  as long as Kensington keeps making these.,5,1,900
A1NFUURN2RV9GT,2324,My mount came in without any hardware. No bolts. washers. sleeves. anchors.or spanners. I did check the box for the proper model number .ML563B.. and I did check the description to make sure hardware should have been included . Standard hardware and user manual included. ..Amazon offered me a return at no cost. as they shipped it but did not sell the product. My options were to refund for another model. reorder the same model and risk the same issue. or just buy the hardware myself. I spent nearly USD10 on hardware. but my 40  television is securely mounted to the wall. The arms are a bit stiff. but they dont move once theyve been adjusted. It has the right tilt for mounting near the ceiling.,3,0,701

A1NIBE2WEWDQN3,1516,The paper with the adhesive is separate from the clips. You have to position the paper on the clip and then pull off a paper to reveal the sticky side.

A1NKIGV40OT9WS,11,I bought this product because Im impressed with the feature it has. and as a customer support engineer I need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to  carry on the street. Most of the time I carry it as a backpack. But its  not tough as it should be. It last only 1 month and the inner side between  the padded computer compartment began to tear. Because it has a lifetime  warranty. I went back to the shop and got a new one. After a month plus  again the inner side .I will say it as a weakness. is starting to tear and  then I will go back to the shop to replace it.,2,0,634
A1NKL8VNOV1LBF,910,I edit a scientific journal and write reference materials for clients.

WordPerfect 8.0. would eventually crash.Having no need other than getting a reliable backup filing system. I chose the 100M USB Iomega. based largely on other customers reviews. Im very pleased with my selection. It was a snap to install. even for a computermoron like me. In an afternoon of work. I backed up all my files .100 technical manuscripts 3 books..

A1NO56ON6QPBGO,2833,I had heard many good things about flatpanel monitors and my eyes get  tired after long hours in front of my old monitor. since prices have come  down in the past few months I decided to splurge and take my coworkers  advice. Glad I did!  There is no going back to a regular monitor again.  This Viewsonic model I found to have the clearest picture and much better  color representation than the other brands. Its unbelievable how sharp  this unit is. I saw it at a local store .Compusa I think it was. and it  looked great there. its even better sitting on my desk at home. I cant  say enough good things about this monitor. The clarity and everything is  fabulous! I could sit in front of the VP150 all day long and not feel any  eye strain.

Lots of positions to put your tv in with a little tlc and effort in how you get the tv in your desired postion.There were all types of screws in the box. but the only ones that scewed into the bak of my tv were too long or too short.

A1NQBVFVB4JXHL,0,Unfortunately. one of the two tapes was defective and does not work.  I did not return it as the postage cost would exceed the value of the tape.,2,0,145
A1NQNJ3EAZ6CMZ,22,I bought this cover for my girlfriend for Christmas. The only complaint shes had so far is the taking a photo with the case on. You have to kinda hold the flap in order to take it. That sounds pretty minor to me though.,4,1,219
A1NQNTVMQ29D4N,0,I purchased the GE Super Radio specifically for listening to distant AM .DXing.radio stations. The GE Super Radio far exceeded my expectations for clear reception of distant stations. Ive managed to monitor literally hundreds of stations all over the continent. incluing stations in Canada. The performs well for what it was designed to do. This radio would be a great tool for those who live in remote areas. There are only two minor things that I would change with the GE Super Radio. The first would be a backlit display for the analog dial. Its difficult to figure out where you are at on the dial in low light. The other would be to add a stereo circut for the headphones only. As this radio only has one speaker. but it would be possible to generate stereo through the headphones on the FM band. and this radio does not do that.,5,1,834
A1NQPG5IJ43HJI,33,Works ok. but I do not like the feel of the ear pieces. they are hard to keep on your ear. would not recommend.,3,0,111
A1NS1PGJZWCN52,0,This sony camcorder TRV 310 is having IC defalt and after few hours of use screen will flash and the system will shut down.This is not worth at all.I do not recoment any one to buy this product.,1,0,194

A1NTDZDBB6MKAP,1,I bought one for my home phone .a Panasonic 2.4 GHz. u0026amp it works great.  I even use the headseat more than I thought I would.  .It seemed like such a gimmick at the time...but a cool gimmick..  I just bought a new mobile  phone .an LG330. u0026amp this headset works well with that too .with the  addition of one cheap adapter that I had to buy from GTE..  I wanted one  for my house u0026amp one to keep in my car. For 10 bucks. you cant beat it.  In fact. GTE .temporarily. sold me a headset for USD60 .before I realized  that the one I had would work..  Theirs was a piece of JUNK!  It was  flimsy wouldnt stay on my ear had a tiny speaker that only sounded well  when it was shoved into my ear .which is very uncomfortable. and a thin  wire as a microphone which was hard to control since the position on my ear  was always changing as it slid around.  Besides. I did sound tests to  compare the 2. the ATu0026ampT sounded better on my end and the people I spoke  with could hear me better with the ATu0026ampT.  No contest.  I just ordered  my 2nd ATu0026ampT 90800.,5,1,1077
A1NTMM8G2Q6P4G,1717,Overall a nice case but I really had to think about how to best put it on so that I could get to the buttons. It seems to be made for a lefty and Im a right handed person.Its sturdy and wipes off easy enough. It didnt come with a stylus but has a space for one. Nice case for the price.,4,1,286
A1NTWAU662MBVF,11,it works nicely and it is easy to take it with your netbook anywhere you go.  I like it.,4,0,88
A1NUAX0GYD3076,0,always go cheap for digital cables. i found this same cable at Walmart for ten times the price. no difference what so ever.,5,0,123
A1NUBAJ1YQCKVP,0,Works great. but is rough on batteries!Also. battery compartmmens is insinde and awkwardly siuated under tape deck.BUT where else can you buy a cassette player?Love the headphones. they pop into the ear. give great bass!!I bought 3. one for my ate wife. and 2 for me.,4,1,267
A1NUJJPJ2HA1JA,0,The six routing clips are a bit stiff u0026 do not lock in the cable as with other similar clips but with little effort wires can be inserted.The two  bowtie   bondler clips are also very stiff where it will take an effort in slip wires in . both these are for a semipermanent install ..I am not concerned with the selfadhesive mounting pieces provided as I will apply my own.The two  corner mount cable channels   are a 5 star rating. each channel will hold 2 cables such as cat . coaxial. HDMI.securely,3,0,504
A1NVVGYM4JHK6M,0,The pleather that they use is extremely cheap looking. It isnt comparable at all to the moleskin book covers. I was hoping for something that looked professional. and while this does protect my laptop from scratches and stuff. it just looks bad.,2,0,245
A1NWPDKQHYIF5L,79,I ordered this because I have a few CDs that skip occasionally.  Unfortunately. this device did not do what it promissed.  In fact. its really much more work than its worth.  First of all. the first 2 cds I  tried only skipped a little bit.  After putting them through this device.  they skipped even more.  The directions say you must really buff them with  the special buffing cloth.  I dont know how much buffing people are  willing to do but Im a relatively strong guy and I buffed for about 10  minutes before being exhausted.  Then I tried again and was just very  dissapointed.  Even worse. the spinning of the handle is quite time  consuming and not very much fun.  It would be very nice if the thing was  mechanical and automatic.  I have little patience for plastic toys.  The  thing even gets water all over the place.  All in all. a good idea I  suppose. but really a dissapointing performance.  Im afraid to use it on  any more CDs.,2,0,945
A1NX2OBV6S4QUD,1212,After reading the fine print warnings on the label .much first aid advice on what to do if the patient stops breathing after coming into contact with the solution.... we carefully put a couple of drops of cleaning solution on the tape. put the cassette  in the player. and listened as it choked and ground and clicked. and then refused to come out when I hit eject.  In the process of wrestling the cassette out of the player. the tape broke.  Hoping that the few seconds of cleaning had done some good. we then put in a regular tape. which DID play better for a few minutes. then quickly faded.I guess well try a different brand. but this one definitely didnt work.,1,0,666
A1NX2OBV6S4QUD,68,As others have said. this product works very well and does what I bought it to do. .My particular VCR wont even try to play once the heads are dirty. so the cleaner brought it back to life..  I did have to use it twice in one day ... but Ive been playing a lot of tapes that have been sitting unplayed in a dusty room for quite some time.Being accustomed to wet cleaners. I WAS rather startled to find that this one talks to you as it works.,4,1,441
A1NXJIOFAGKJDX,0,I bought my Microsoft Intellimouse about 2 years ago and Im still using it.The contours of this mouse are perfectly designed for the human hand. when I had my old mouse that came with my computer. my hand would hurt all  if I used it for more than about 20 minutes. and Im only a occasional  mouse user. but with the Microsoft Intellimouse. I find myself enjoying my  mouse much more.The Intellimouse also has many great features. most  notibly the scroll wheel. With the scroll wheel on the mouse you can scroll  through documents and webpages without having to move the mouse all the way  to the little arrows and keep pushing the mouse button.Through and  through. the Microsoft Intellimouse is a great mouse. comfort wise. feature  wise. and price wise.,5,1,757
A1NXMP064PLGNU,55,I know ereaders have been reviewed to death. so I will make my review short and sweet. I was considering the Kindle with Special Offers .cheapest version. but found a super deal on a Nook Simple Touch. I am glad I decided to go with Bu0026Ns ereader for the following reasons. nice matte screen smooth. comfortable. curved ergonomic shape epub support longer battery life touch AND button operation. The main downside for me is the lack of free booksspecial offers that Amazon does for the Kindle. Bu0026N just doesnt have as many good deals or as often. Aside from that. highly recommend!,5,1,589
A1NXYJMRNEO1X7,44,A better buy than all the other players on the market at the moment. It offers a large onboard memory .64MB.. expansion .though it would be better to wait for higher density cards to emerge than buy the ones available at  the moment.. high quality playback and fast USB download capabilities.  However. the software requires much perseverence. The basic bundle  completely confuses the way your mp3s are stored on your HD and the  upgrades .Audio Manager 3.2 being the most conspicuous of the bunch.  occasionally lead to lower quality playback. Also. you will only ever get  about 10 hours play out of the batteries rather than the quoted 13. Still.  this is still better than most other products. In short. as long as you  stick with the original software and wait for better cards. the Rio 500 is  undoubtedly the best product available at the moment.,4,1,854

A1NZH03BZTSPS2,0,There is an unspoken war going on in the trenches of digital reading devices.  First there was the innovative kindle. which revolutionized the industry and created a new medium and format for ebooks then came the residual affects of copycat devices like the Nook.  The Nook is being pushed aside and underestimated.  I discovered that the nook was easier to upload and download material onto but it was not as accessible as far as distribution and popularity of ebooks. it lags behind the kindle in popularity because it seems like an imitator.  Some time has to go by since the kindle came out then Nook should make some huge improvements. this is a way that it could overtake the kindle because Barnes u0026 Noble has brick and mortar stores to sell their Nooks and books in which is where most people would come across reading devices.  However. most reading device readers use the internet frequently and they would cater to online stores where they would normally have downloaded ebooks and look toward Kindle instead.,4,1,1023
A1NZLRAZJGD99W,6,I ordered both the Belkin 25 ft CAT 5e and the Belkin 50 ft. CAT 5e cables since I was not sure if the 25 ft cable would be long enough  as it turned out the 25 ft cable was just what I needed so I did not use the 50 ft. cable.  The 25 ft cable comes in Belkin packaging and markings but .like other reviewers stated. the 50 ft. cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in China and there is no indication that the cable is a Belkin.I gave this 2 stars because it does not appear to be a Belkin product  I would give the 25 ft. cable 5 stars.,2,0,545
A1NZYQ9R9RJS7B,22,My husband has found a lot of his books he needed for school at a much cheaper price and he loves it and how much money it has saved,4,1,132

A1O08QUUK4UY3A,0,Cable works perfectly to run from my router to my Xbox. Cheaper than the wireless adapter and much faster. Also works great for my Bluray player. Speed is perfect for online gaming. but it is primarily used for highdef video from Netflix. No bottlenecks or slowdowns. Perfect length if your modem or router is close by.,5,1,319

A1O1FP37UZUY7,22,This product was misrepresented it was supposed to be a cddvd player external to be used on my mini computer. but it would only read cds and will not read dvds.,1,0,160
A1O23ILOT7E72N,13,I had this product overnighted so that i would have it in time for the arrival for my new system. I run a harman kardan receiver with a denon dvd.  this product does not fit tightly into the optical source of either unit.  It does fit well enough to work. and sounds great. however the link simply sits in the slot and can easily fall out. ive called the manufacturer a few times and have been told that it should fit. Unfortunately i had to go and buy an entire new cable for my system.  my advice is to buy something yoiu can actually see first hand. and return quite easily if it is not the proper fitting.,1,0,609
A1O2IZCM1Y3466,1523,This camera is terrible.  The manual focus does not work at all.  Under normal light. the picture quality is acceptable. but really poor under low light.  The software included is extremely poor. and the technical support from Xirlink .the maker of the camera. is worse.  I tried using the camera on both Win98 and Mac. the Win98 driver works but I had to download a 3rdparty software for the capturing to work.  On the Mac side. the driver provided is from 1996.!.  what a joke.For the money. youre better off getting the Logitech or the Kensington for a little more.  This camera will only give you big headaches.,1,0,615
A1O2L1FBTLUFFV,1010,I have listened to practically every boombox available on the market. and this boombox is the best Ive heard.  When you turn up the volume close to its maximum. the sound is still clean. not distorted and scratchy like most  boomboxes.  Most boomboxes have some sort of feature which enhances the  bass and low frequency midrange notes.  This boombox. instead of a  onebutton u0026quotall or nothingu0026quot bass enhancement. has a variable bass  enhancement feature it has six levels to choose from. and each level is  distinctly more powerful than the previous level.  I am 100% totally  satisfied with this product.,5,1,619
A1O3FYVHHWC8CJ,55,Believe it or not. some of us still use VHSOnly because we are digitizing them now. Converting an analog tape to digital media takes its toll on a VCR and the heads get dirty beyond recognition. Eventually Ill have to tear down my deck to clean it properly but for now this cleaning tape really helps,3,0,300
A1O3H7LAPA7CKV,11,This product did not work as I had expected.  Each cleaning cycle should take about 20 seconds.  After a few cleaning cycles. I saw no improvement in the sound or picture quality.I was determined to improve the quality of my VCRs playback so I could begin converting my VHS tapes to DVD.  I spent over an hour playing the head cleaner.  I wouldnt say that there was no improvement the picture quality was slightly enhanced.  The sound quality did not improve at all.I have used wet cleaners in the past with success. but I wanted to save a few dollars by buying the dry cleaner.  Dont waste your time like I did!  Buy a wet cleaner!,1,0,632

A1O89ISKMIXTE6,22,I was excited to get this vcr cleaner in the mail.  I had two DVDVCR combo players one that hadnt worked in a while and the other that was only a year old. Neither one was playing.  I used the cleaner on the oldest one and it made an improvement but not enough where I could start playing my tapes again.  It didnt work on my newer machine at all.  At first it played my manufactered movies. but when my wife started playing videos recorded from TV it refused to play the other tapes.  In all fairness I dont really know what the problem is. but I had hoped this would be the solution.  Oh yeah. the tape came out of the package and I had to toss it the same day.,2,0,663

A1OA1WF8AOR39T,22,I decided I wanted a headset so that I could talk on the phone while doing work or cooking around my house.  I looked at both this Uniden headset and  the ATu0026ampT one that is also sold on Amazon.  Even though I read the  reviews on here that said this headset can easily break I went ahead and  bought one for cheap off the Amazon.com Outlet.  I used it for a few months  and was pretty happy with it.  It was comfortable on my head. easy to  adjust. sounded good. and I never got any complaints from people I was  talking to.Then it broke.So now Im about to shell out some more  money for the ATu0026ampT headset and I figured Id share my new found wisdom  with everyone else.,2,0,681
A1OAHXLO9PC6LC,7075,No matter where you put these speakers. they give constant feedback.  Ive tried everything I can think of. but nothing works.  I have to turn them off at night. otherwise the static buzz keeps me awake.  If you are looking for high quality speakers. these are definately not them.,1,0,280
A1OBD46QPMQTYK,24,Ive been using this mouse quite a few years and it without a doubt the best. most comfortable out there. As a CAD manager. Ive had the opportunity to sit at many users PCs and none of the variety of input devised Ive encountered match the overall comfort and ease of use as the Trackman. Many of the other track ball input devices on the market force your hands into more unnatural movements.The best two features of the Trackman FX is the location of the marble in the mouse and being able to rest your hand and wrist the on the base of the mouse. Both these two features relieve the stresses on ones hand. arm and shoulder. With this one. you dont push a mouse. you naturally the marble. Throw away that mouse pad! It sits cozy in your hand without having to contort your fingers. Anatomically correct!,5,1,804
A1OCL0T2SWY6VG,33,After 1 year and 2 months of serious playtime for DVDs and CDs my player died in the middle of a movie and subsequently will no longer play any more or recognize any disc inside it. just the pathetic noise it makes as it tries to start the discs to no avail. I know what this means. SONY has ..... me again. Thats 2 SONY CD players to have the pickup laser die on me. But you know what. the picture and enjoyment was so great in the time that I owned it. Im upgrading to the new SONY DVPNS400D and praying that it lasts longer this time.4 stars becaue the damn thing died in a little more than year after what I would estimate as 300 hours of usage.,4,1,649
A1ODBZL50RANSX,1111,I first bought the Grundig 2000A for USD78 plus an additional USD14 for an AC adapter. It was garbage. Merely adaquate FM reception and almost nonexistent shortwave reception. I didnt find one SW station that came in well enough to listen to. Then I bought the Grundig YB300PE for USD40. It was lighter. flimsier feeling and not as goodlooking than 2000A but it was so much better. It has somewhat better FM reception and shortwave reception thats light years ahead. It actually picked up a good number of stations. In addition. it has some features that the 2000A doesnt have like an AC adapter. a DXlocal switch. an external antenna port and an 16 wire antenna for the port. Im sure its not the best shortwave radio out there but for its size and price. it has to stack up well against others. Its an excellent value and I am glad I got it.,4,1,842
A1ODQ6STR9YD92,38,Item was received in perfect condition.  Works just like the older versions I used before.  Very good for regular cleaning.  If your tapes are in bad shape or your rollers are especially dirty. you may have to do a more vigorous cleaning.  If your tapes are in good shape. this cleaner in combination with a demagnetizing cassette is probably all youll ever need.  Eventually. cleaning pads have to be replaced . . . very easy to do.  A good solution for most of us.,4,1,466

A1OG22AV0FS7F1,0,Very high level of noise three pixels on all the time. Otherwise its about as good as a low quality surveillance cam. I dont know  what the other reviewers are used to but they need to look around. For the price its OK in good light forget it when the light begins to fade. The software is somewhat deficient too. when I tried to do a video capture it froze up.I would not recommend this to anyone,2,0,397
A1OG6CQY5X3TCG,0,I read the reviews and awaited this radio for a trip to Tennesssee. Once I got it. it didnt work at all. changed batteries and used AC. I wanted it to work. but in the long run was a real disappointment.  Nothing like static and would not transmit. Pretty much a waste.,1,0,269
A1OGCHIKLXIDYA,12,I have an A120 Panasonic DVD player and I think for the price I paid it is one great machine.  A few maintanence things that are helpful is just using a cd cleaner once a month.  I dont have any problems with anything else in  its performance.  It is simple to use and its DTS is amazing.  Other brands  have more complicated options on them and that drives up the price.  But  for your basic home theater you cant beat the price and the quality.  Just  take care of it!,5,1,470

A1OJ7C3GQMEDTS,12,I bought the Premium Canon Mini HDMI 10 ft. cable from Amazon.com instead of the recommended Canon HTC100 cable. I know. there was some risk. and the substitute cable was made in China. but as other reviewers have pointed out. it works like a charm! I ran it between my Canon Rebel T3 camera and our Panasonic HDTV. Both the still photos and videos appeared on the TV screen in widescreen HD quality. and the audio portion of the videos was as clear as a bell  really amazing! So go ahead and spend the USD7.30. You wont be sorry!Premium Canon Mini HDMI cable .10 ft.,5,1,567
A1OLG8WQ4EAPMF,45,Received this as a gift last Christmas .11 months ago.. Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading. one should be able to use it for a month on one charge. My battery already lasts only 2  2 12 hrs on one charge before the unit wont start due to a low battery level. requiring recharging. This is either a false claim on the part of B u0026 N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality. Ive used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years if this thing suffers from a battery problem. then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality  lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago. Keep away.,2,0,695

A1OOCS2TXLPV3B,33,This may be a great video camera  I wouldnt know.  I have had this thing for a week and have spent hours and hours trying to figure out how to video conference with it.  The instructions which come with the product are  minimal at best  oh. it is easy to install  but what good is a lifeless  camera.  You would think that setting up video conferencing would be easy   but. I wouldnt know and I am about ready to toss the thing into the  rubbish. I had actually hoped to use this camera. silly me. So now I will  be bugging everyone I know who might know something of how to use it as the  manufacturers certainly didnt have novices in mind.  It shouldnt have to  be so difficult.,2,0,680
A1OPERQ94O8SNS,3545,The Bitronics Autoswitch works just as youd expect.  I boughtit at amazon.com to switch between a HP Laserjet 6L and an HP Officejet scannerprinterfax... the Laserjet is my main printer. but occasionally I use the Officejet to scan pictures and the like.  .And note that theres no problem using bidirectional devices like scanners..It works like a champ.  No need to install the .optional. software. no need to plug it in just hook up the cables and youre good to go.  You just press a button to switch between the two devices.Only thing to know is that theres nothing u0026quotautomaticu0026quot about this you need to do the switching yourself.  The word u0026quotautomaticu0026quot refers to another way you can use this switch to hook two PCs up to a single device.  I dont need this capability. so I havent tried it.Good product.,5,1,834

A1OQSMIATYAWVK,0,I recieved a nook color for Christmas The instructions are useless. You get to the wifi selection screen and are unable to navigate away fron that screen. It tells you to go to nookcolor.comwifi which does not exist. I have screen with numbers and wifi on it. What is the purpose of this screen. It tells me to press the home button and nothing happens. Also why must I be a menmber of Barnes and Nobles to buy a book from them. I dont understand why a book company can not supply simple instructions also what wifi provider should I use as different providers probably work better in dofferent locations. They should a least give you some information on that. I reqad alot and after this experience I will never spend another cent in Barnes and nobles and will be returnng there product.,1,0,788

A1OQYBF625961C,12,When it comes to standard parallel printer cables. Belkin is unbeatable. I can almost hear the printer control characters dashing from one end of this 15foot charmer to the next. And the connectors! Absolutely beautiful. One end fits in your printer. the other  into your PC. One. two. and. youre done. All thats left is to step back and admire your handiwork. I needed this cable because the old one wasnt long enough. The generous 15 feet of this Belkin standard parallel printer cable was exactly what I needed. If you are in need of a standard parallel printer cable. and you have a gap of about 15 feet between your PC and printer. I can unequivocally recommend this Belkin F2A03615 Standard Parallel Printer Cable by Belkin Components.,5,1,741
A1ORUSHRRG0VWN,11,I bought this Palm V Hotsync Cradle as a replacement to my old one that had been stolen...The cradle itself works great. It is easy to install and required no extra software if you already the Hotsync software installed. A good product.,4,1,236
A1ORUSHRRG0VWN,57,I have used a Microsoft Keyboard for some time know and I have to admit to  liking it.  It has worked for me very well and I would not go back to a  regular keyboard unless I absolutely had to.  The ergonomic design really  does make a difference this is evident every time I have to type on a  regular keyboard.  I feel the strain on my wrists.  The natural keyboard  almost completely does away with this.  I would recommend this keyboard and  other like it.  One of my complaints is that the keys do seem a little  small for people with bigger hands. and the price is a little high.  If you  dont want to fork over USD50 for a keyboard there are others out there that  will give the same effect and wrist relief for much lowers prices.,4,1,738
A1ORUSHRRG0VWN,44,I have had this mouse for over two years and over all I am happy with it.  The only problem that I have had with this mouse is the scrolling feature.  Over several months it looses the friction between your finger and the  wheel and this makes it very difficult to scroll up or down with it.  Other  than this problem it has been a good mouse.  If I had it to do over again I  would probably buy one of the Logitech mice.  I have talked to people that  have Logitech mice and the problem with the scrolling has not been an issue  with them.,3,0,540
A1ORUSHRRG0VWN,11,I bought this player in December of 99 and ever since have had no problems with it what so ever.  It has been a great player. not only in picture and sound quality but also in price.  There arent many players out there that  offer the same quality. price. and amount of features.  I have used this  player with 2 different Sony TVs and it has worked flawlessly with both  using the Svideo connector.  I have not experienced any of the problems  that other people seemed to have experienced with this player.  I would  highly recommend this player.,5,1,547
A1ORUSHRRG0VWN,0,I have had my Zip drive for almost 3 years and it has worked great.  Although the performance of the drive has been great I find that the media to be too expensive and much larger than the comparable LS120 drives.  Another suggestion is your buying this drive to use it for fast access to  your files. dont go with the parallel.  Instead go with the internal IDE  or the SCSI.  Both of these are at least twice as fast as a parallel drive.,4,1,439

A1OTSX3JOCZH6K,1,when the original seller that I ordered from failed to send me anything. Amazons A to Z guarantee came through for me.  I was able to get a giftcard immediately online for the amount I was out with the other seller.  Amazon was offering this 3pack of tapes for only a couple of dollars more than the other one. I ordered it immediately that night and it showed up on my doorstep less than 48 hours later.  Outstanding!!!!!  Thank you again Amazon.,5,1,447
A1OVSKQCT56NTT,11,I own the 950 since the first days when it was launched. Since it is a product with many reviews. I will perhaps focus on a few positive and negative aspects I have found over this time.For positive. well. overall image quality is very good. colors are very balanced and not artificially saturated for that extra good look. I found myself doing some level adjustment sometimes. you will still need your Photoshop. but in any case. even with highend professional models. you are likely to end up doing some digital darkroom work. The 2.11 CCD is quite good and enough to print excellent photoquality A4 .Im in Europe. thats about the area of a 17u0026quot monitor. prints that people will mistake for normal photos .matched with a good printer of course.. The firmware is very effective. but a few features have been improved in the 990. which I have used too. The swivel design ends up being VERY useful. Trust me. you will notice the difference sometimes when a normal camera wouldnt work as good.My favorite aspect has to be the absolutely AMAZING macro mode. The 950 can focus sharply at a ridiculously small distance from the subject. This thing is almost a microscope. Yes. it can be tricky to adjust lightning in those cases. but the ability to focus so well at such distances really impressed me when this model came out.So to keep it short. Im happy when it comes to overall image quality. color accuracy. and features the main problems with this model are.Considerable barrel distortion at wide angle. If you do a lot of architectural photos or are just unlucky and pick a tricky shot .like a door for instance. at the edges of the screen. at wide angle. well. it is way too obvious sometimes. Few digital cameras offer highquality lens that are completely .almost. barrel distortion free. but I cant help looking at some cheap digicams using Zeiss lenses and feeling that the Coolpix deserved better. At Tele. the problem is a lot less obvious. but on wide. expect some of your lines to be more like.well...splines. No USB interface. no Firewire. no nothing besides the plain old serial interface. Ever tried transferring 48MB at 115k? Well. lets just say that it reminds me the days when I used analog modems. A lot of patience is required. Again. this could and should have been released with USB support .which was widely available at the time..  Big body. The camera is a big big. not cigarretepacket size like some Canons and other models. so. that might end up meaning that youll take it with you less often. Some chromatic distortion .purple edges. etc. under certain conditions.  Forget about using Alkalines they will last 10 minutes. Go for NiMh 1600 rechargeables. The 8MB default card will only hold about 10 photos at maximum resolution. or 1 if you dont want lossy compression. 48 MB or 64 MB cards are essential. Panel isnt always visible under bright sunlight .newer firmware revisions have addressed this issue. but its still tricky sometimes. First versions of NikonView were incredibly . to the point of the user not being able to recover transferred photos after a connection failure .that meant that aborted transfers at 90% of the card when youre using a slow serial protocol meant starting all over. quite fun.. Dont worry. NikonView is now a lot more solid and. but I did suffer with the first versions.Overall. a very good camera that can give you very good photos .and that means printed photos.. Also. keep in mind that the final price ends up rising. since youre likely to need at least the following accessories. A Bigger CompactFlash card .48 MB or 64 MB.. At least 4 NiMh 1600 batteries + a charger. and a decent caseWith Zeiss lens instead of the Nikkor 721mm used and USB interface. this could still be the best 2.11 on the market.  Because of these details. and since I paid full retail USD when it came out. Im keeping a star to myself...,4,1,3883

A1OWW6GE4BV4RX,2729,I got this for my son. who said it worked great in one car but not in the one he normally drives .even with the volume turned to maximum. music was soft and had a lot of hiss..  I changed the cord to the other end of the cassette. and then it worked great. the volume is now fine.  The only problem was my son felt rather silly for not having thought of switching the cord.  If anyone else with low volume problems hasnt tried switching the cord so the cassettee can be turned over. try it.,5,1,490

A1OZC47MULKE9P,0,I was initially quite impressed with this card  though the unique voodoo to vga cable adaptor was a bit odd. The card performed well. and actually still is. However. the special cable that came with the card .the only one that will allow your monitor to view the signal. is having problems now. If this was any other card I could easily buy a new VGA cable. Voodoo shortsightedness in the making of this product puts me in an awkward position  buy a new card so that Im not tied to a propriatary setup or search eBay for an extra cable. All in all. not worth the ticket pricel,2,0,576

A1OZYQ4V83X8K4,22,I had a pair of Jensen headphones that were similar to these that got worn out and broke on the side .wish I remembered the model  but theyre long gone in the trash. so I thought id get another pair of Jensens because the others sounded great.  Boy was I wrong. these headphones sound like complete garbage. the treble is horrible. the bass is horrible. everything. these are worse than the trashy earbud style headphones I got with my mp3 player. Pay a few extra bucks and buy something else because youll end up trashing these and getting something else anyway like I did.,1,0,574

A1P0T2LT65ENSE,0,Do not purchase if you live in Canada. they do not work here you need to have a US address!The Nook Color itself is a good sturdy design. brilliant colour and I am sure had all features worked for me it would of been a great device.Unfortunately they do not work in Canada.  Do your research. Barnes u0026 Noble dont sell them here.  The stores who sell to Canada and say there is a fix. the fix is to travel to the US and buy Barnes u0026 Nobles gift cards to use!Please be aware of this. I thought I had done enough research and took a leap of faith in hopes of a fix working but it didnt and I ended up USD100 out of pocket on shipping. duties and restock fees!,2,0,664
A1P0TDLIRX2P3C,0,Out of the box the V90 is easy to use. Though the manual does give insight as to some of the more exotic features. the basic record and play functions are a snap.I carried the V90 with me for a month. testing working ability and ministry application. On ability. the V90 is a champ. At no time did I have any difficulty operating the recorder. and it always did a good job recording. The hold function is especially useful. as it locks the keys to avoid unintentional record or playback when the unit is in a pocket or purse. The visual display is easy to read. and the folders are easy to navigate. The only folder that was at all dificult to navigate was the SFolder. which is used to record alarms for later playback.On ministry application. the V90 confirmed my suspicions that a digital recorder would be a great tool for ministry. I found it handy when talking with people to record short notes to myself with prayer requests. phone numbers. and action items. No more fumbling for pen and paper .or napkin. or back of business card. or palm of hand!..The ergonomic design is stylish and makes for good conversation. but probably unnecessary. With the small size and light weight. it probably would not matter if it were rectangular. In fact. it might be easier for a guy with large hands .like me. to hold a rectangular recorder .check out the VN90!..,4,1,1357

A1P3DDFL423B3C,11,I dont understand all the negative reviews about this changer. Ive owned this changer for about 6 months now. and find it more than suitable for casual use.  My previous 5 disc changer was a Kenwood CD203 .purchased in 1998. I also own a Pioneer 301 disc changer.  Before purchasing this changer. I was quite apprehensive due to the negative reviews on here.  I bit the bullet. as my Kenwood changer was acting up. and I am quite happy with this product.This changer has never skipped on me or presented other issues.  I use the optical output on the changer to connect to my receiver. and the quality is excellent.  The remote works even with sloppy angles.  The changer is quiet when changing CDs .rotating the carousel.. and the display is readable from across the room.There are a few little quirks.  The changer differentiates between exchanging a CD .thus not interrupting the currently playing CD. and not opening the drawer all the way. and open. which stops the current CD and opens the drawer.  Personally. I find the distinction a little annoying. since I almost always want to exchange.  My previous Kenwood has no such distinction.I also wish the remote layout and buttons were a little more friendly to use by touch and not by sightI like to listen to music in low light or even darkness. so I had to memorize some of the remote buttons .In particular. disc skip is located in the middle of the remote..However. these are extremely minor nits.  The changer is excellent. feels sturdy. and has survived about 600 hours of use in the last 6 months.  I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend the changer to anyone looking for a low capacity changer.,5,1,1671

A1P7T6D2L8RC1C,0,We have an older Packard Bell which I was able to upgrade to its maximum of 64 MB of memory and Windows 98.  It works well in a small office for word processing. etc but without a network card it couldnt share files with the newer machines.  This Packard Bell has no PCI or ISA slots. so there was no way to add a regular network card.  Fortunately. it has one USB port. so a USBEthernet adapter is the perfect solution.  This 3Com USB NIC is easy to install.  Run the driver software and plug in the NIC.  Then. check the usual network settings. and youre in business.  Now the computer is networked to the other machines through a LinkSys router. and has high speed internet access. too.,5,1,689
A1P8W0HATB9U86,22,I needed a few extra CAT 5e cables to hook up some devices to my home network.

A1PC3H8P4MZ3BV,26,Like another reviewer here. I can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism. On my Nakamichi BX300. they frequently stop during recording or playback. Its a tension problem. wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage basically. it thinks the tape is stuck. Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes. Ive had no problem with other. commercially available cassettes on this deck.My advice. if you have these tapes. is to run them a bit before you record to them. Pop em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape. then rewind fully. Maybe a few times. With one tape. after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side. until I performed the above. YMMV. Recorded audio sounds fine.I would add that these are recommended in the Nakamichi owners manual. Go figure.,2,0,922

A1PCSGMFTCOZSQ,45,Ive had my camera for two months and I love it. I am sure not a professional photographer but I took some great pictures from the very first. I have taken over 500 pics using all three focus depths and they  turned out beautifully.  Of course. I took some that were too dark but that  was not the fault of the camera.  I wish that it would take the 16MB and  the 32MB cards. but I get over 90 pictures on the 8MB card in the three  star mode and they are of very good quality.  Price was right. too.,4,1,499

A1PEFK6SSTM02G,0,I love the new Nook my husband and I got!  Its a great product.  We have been able to download books with ease.  It doesnt take long to download the books either.  Its just that we live in Alaska. where it is very cold in the winter.  We have to wait 24 hours before plugging in our Nook to charge it.

For me. the best features are its address book and the u0026quotTo  Do List.u0026quot  Gone are the little scraps of paper I used to use to keep  all my lists of stuff to do.  Ive been completely neglecting my paper  address book ever since I got the IIIx.  Between its small size. its ease  of use. and its versatility. this Palm is a winner all around.  BTW. I  highly recommend the OReilly PalmPilot guide to go with it.  Like all  OReilly books. this one cuts right to the chase.  It makes the IIIx even  easier to use.,5,1,683
A1PG25M78VQX11,9395,This trackball worked great for about the 1st 6 months. Of course. I had to clean it at least once a week because the mechanisms that operate the trackball get extremely gummed up and any hair or fibers will get wrapped around the small rollers inside. I loved this trackball because I am a left handed mouser u0026amp I have very small hands. this trackball allowed me to be on my computer for hours with minimal discomfort. But after 6 months the bliss ended with a trackball that wouldnt track. I sent it back to kensington u0026amp they repaired it u0026amp sent it back to me. Meanwhile I went out u0026amp bought another just like it while my old one was being repaired. I thought it was just a defective unit. but after about 6 months the new trackball stopped tracking too.So I wouldnt buy this product unless you dont mind shipping it out to repaired every 6 months for 3 years u0026amp then buying a new one .because Kensington only warranties this product for 3 years..Its shame because out of the box its the best trackball Ive used. Im now using an Logitech Marble Mouse.

A1PGUHJ9ZN499P,12,These straps are great for the general purpose of organizing entertainment center cords.  computer system cords... Etc.  My intended use for these straps was to manage cords for medical equipment during travel.  The worn straps these were to replace looped onto a cord before wrapping allowing it to stay in place when the cords are released.  Unfortunately.  these are missing that same basic design feature making them more likely to get lost as you need to secure it everytime you release the cord.  whereas other velcro straps remain secure at all times.  Not a big deal if you just want to organize cords of stationary electronics.  but then again for that purpose you may as well save a few dollars and buy a bag of classic zip ties.,3,0,739
A1PHYZAE6N9MDB,0,I researched several different solutions for securing my laptop at work after a few of them were stolen.  Kensington products are widely regarded as the industry standard for laptop security cables. and my particular laptop .HP NC2400. was compatible.  This cable also fits into my docking station. which makes it doublehandy.  But like many other reviewers have noted. this is not a panacea for thwarting laptop theft.  I not only loop my cable through the security hole in my desk. but I also loop it through a set of mugs that I bought at my local dollar store. so if anyone tries to cut the cable. theyll make a loud ruckus.  Just a suggestion to increase the efficacy of this lock for a few bucks more.,4,1,707

A1PJKGNMUEGEWO,2327,I bought this Barlow Len to use with a 25mm piece or 9mm piece that came withMeade 20218 NG70SM 70mm Altazimuth Refractor Telescope.  I wanted to use this Barlow Lens with the 9mm to watch Saturn and Jupiter.  I was worried it would be a bit too much. and it was.For example. the first issue was to get Saturn on the center of the field of view.  Once I got it on the center. I would have about 10 seconds before Saturn would drift out the field of view again.  The second issue was to get the telescope to focus.  Even the slightest tap on the nob would change of focus. and cause the image to vibrate.  However. once I got past these issues .not a trivial task.. I was able to observe how the shadow of Saturn darkened the ring behind.  Awesome!During the time of the Venus Transient .June 5. 2012.. I used my telescope with this Barlow to project the image on the wall. It actually worked like a charm. I think I had to extend or retract the telescope all the way .forgot which one.. but I go a clear view of the Sun and Venus.Anyway. be very careful if you try a similar experiment since the telescope does heat up and remember to look only at the projected image.In all. this Barlow Len worked as expected. and I even got it one day earlier than expected from the seller.,4,1,1276

What I mean to say is it is well made and has decent insulation tonot disturb the flow of information between that and your modem.2nd Finally able to color match some of your cables so they actually add to the look of your rig or ambianceI would reccomendthese cables,4,1,289

A1POA1618TJMAW,0,Purchased this item through a third party seller. fulfilled by amazon. The item I recieved was not a Belkin product at all. instead just a cheap offbrand cable. Even worse. the cables turned out to be nonfunctional. Led to a disaster for my photography business at an event where I was printing on site. Do not purchase this item from MarginMart.,1,0,346
A1PORTFBFB91T9,33,I purchased the NIKON coolpix 950 and was disappointed to find out that it does not mount squarely to a tripod. Ive called Canada Customer service and they seemed unconcerned. If you want to take level square pictures be  prepared to modify the bottom of the camera. Hopefully they will read this  and come up with a better solution.Otherwise the camera is great.,4,1,363
A1PPS91NLI7KEH,810,I went from the Sony Reader Pocket Edition .which I really did like. to the Nook after the Wifi only version came out and I do not regret the move.  I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile  I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I dont have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device .the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up.. I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is USD14.99 so I can buy extra .one for home. one for work.  where Sony Readers power cord was almost USD30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook. I just have to go to a nearby Bu0026N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device  exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product.,5,1,1759
A1PQRZQ4LG3KB3,2583,Make sure you plug in BOTH usb cables or it wont work. Average quality for the price. It would be much better if it worked via 1 usb cable since usb ports are limited on most laptops!,4,1,183
A1PS1T0P7XZP6R,11,All the good reviews are right  the picture is great the sound is great. etc. I enjoyed mine immensely  until it turned into a giant paperweight. with the pixelationlockup problems mentioned in numerous reviews. I would  not recommend this nor will I ever buy ANY product made by Panasonic ever  again. due to their total lack of customer support. Buy a Sony. a Pioneer  or a Toshiba  anythings better than Panasonic.PS. For all of those  who wrote positive reviews. I am sorry in advance for when your machines  fail...,1,0,520
A1PSFWLVAH0SFZ,1141,This LED seemed to function as it was intended. however. I returned it because it did not suit my needs.,3,0,104
A1PSG8DOO9YMLM,0,I returned mine for a couple of reasons.  The transport makes too much noise. especially when I listen late at night .I dont want to hear the machine. just the music. and the alarm does not allow you to set volume.  so unless you remember to listen at night at the level you want to wake up  to .so much for the sleep function. it may be too loud or too quiet in the  morning.  I found the Sony CMTED1 to have better sound. and to be more  intelligently designed. for less money.,3,0,479
A1PU4NJBB1UU33,44,Worked perfectly to mount my tv to the wall. TV now swivels easily to accomodate me. It was very easy to install and very sturdy. I was worried it would be cheap but I was incorrect!,4,1,182
A1PVP4AP69IXC4,0,I used this headset often for about a year and have no complaints. The sound quality was good both receiving and transmitting. No one that I asked was able to guess that I was speaking into a headset microphone. so background noise pickup was not a problem.This set was stable on my head  and did not need constant adjustments once set. It survived my office where  Im sure I must have dropped. kicked. and stepped on it more than  once.Other headsets I have an amount of experience with are the Andrea  NC80. and some Labtecs. This is superior. Im buying another HS910 to replace the one that went back with the defective Uniden phone. If there was another headset for the USDUSD. that I felt was better. I would get it.,4,1,721

A1PXJTI5TCW8YQ,0,I reacently bought the diamond rio 500 mp3 player and i was really excited to get it. But when I installed it and all that other crap it wouldnt work! I found out that my mp3 player was defective. I called rio and they  said  that there is alot of defective ones out there so be aware. If you do get a  defective one send it back and I suggest getting the sony vaio music clip  it is probably easier than the rio to use. But if my rio worked I would  have gave it a 5 stars.,1,0,474

A1PYNWE6PYBN5R,0,Looking for a great fast 56k V.90 modem at a reasonable price? So was I and thats when I found this baby! This Sound Blaster ISA modem works just as well as a PCI model because the difference in the ISA slot and PCI slot  is that a PCI slot is better for sound and graphics. When it comes to data  transfer a ISA slot will work best and using the low graphic and sound ISA  slot is ideal for a modem. Dont waste your money on an expensive PCI modem  or a Winmodem which will rob your computers resources. I will not go over  the specs the of this thing in my review because if your reading this I am  sure you read what this wonderfull modem can do! I use this modem for  everything and it is reliable and FAST. Trust me this is a good  buy......,5,1,746
A1Q00VIAQPW82J,1515,Ive been using this pack since day 1.  Ive used it hundreds of times for the gym and my hiking excursions and Ive never had one single problem.  Its pockets are roomy for extra carry along CDs. batteries. or foldup headphones.  The side pockets are ideal for a few keys or some spare cash.  Definitely worth it.Unlike the others I have never had a problem with using the outside netting for holding my CD player.  One thing it is not built for is jogging.  So avoid it if you think its good for that.  Being made of nylon makes it ideal for outdoor conditions that I need for it and it stores great in my car and gym bag.For only USD20 you cant lose out really.,5,1,661
A1Q0GZFOZ9VAF5,44,I love my nook and love my books. This is my 2nd nook color. 1st charging port broke and no longer charges. This one has some glitches and I wish Bu0026N would fix the things people are complaining about bc it is the same problems for everyone. With all the issues. lower the price. Plus. found kindle books are cheaper then bu0026s and kids del has less issues than nooks.,3,0,373
A1Q0ULB2T10IRZ,0,I bought this keyboard because I wanted a keyboard with a touchpad. since I havent been able to use a mouse consistently without having some arm pain.  I thought having the touchpad on the right instead of the center would be more comfortable but turns out its not.  Its ok where it is but I think center may have been even better.  I like the layout of the keyboard though it did take some getting used to the split and slant between left and right hand.  But now that Ive been using it awhile I really like it.  All in all I think its a good keyboard.,4,1,553

A1Q39C6LC6R2GZ,0,I had one of these for several years before it died a natural death and will be getting another one delivered very shortly.

A1Q3S1VTKCB7C3,22,At first I was very excited about getting my new Studio PCTV.  When I opened to box I was suprised to notice that the hardware wasnt very protected.  It could of been EASILY damaged in shipment.  Second I noticed  how thin the manual was.  Installation was rather easy. but I should be  getting to the point.  THIS HARDWARE DOESNT SUPPORT VOODOO3 3DFX!  DONT  LET THE DOCUMENTATION FOOL YOU. IT SIMPLY DOESNT BELIEVE THE DRIVERS ARE  INSTALLED.  Upon the pulg and play window. I popped in the CD.  I was  forced to manually find the files on this foreign CD with no documentation  on where to find these files.  Accidently pressing a wrong button. the  system went crazy and corrpupted all of the files agian.  I had to  reinstall all of the Studio PCTV software once agian.  Then agian... Once I  got to the third installation it figuered I had done it. but I had not.  The realization is simple. 1. This hardware is cheaply made for the cheap  price which is understandable. 2. The software is BADLY written.  Ive  seen better on my IIgs.  It crashes very often for no reason. forcing a  restart and loss of all work. 3. THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT.  As  far as I know of there is no webpage in the manual. 4. I beg you. if you  are looking for video capture PLEASE get something else.  Please dont make  the mistake I did.  Now I have to go through the whole process of returning  this piece of junk.I hope youll understand this.,1,0,1441
A1Q3S1VTKCB7C3,4951,.... Now that DV is here. Pinnacle released a wave of DV capture cards. This is their cheapest one. Unlike pervious Pinnacle products installation was easy this time. it seems that theyve rewritten their installer app. It wont go around searching the A. drive for some file that is on the CD itself. Youll need your Windows 98ME install CD with you .if you own a Dell. you might not have one.. You have to us Pinnacles program for capture and output. but this time its a bit more stable. Capturing is easy. but output isnt. Studio may suddenly stop during output. and you may lose all of your information .and a TON of hard drive space from the fragmented files.. The editing isnt that bad this time. its right up there with the other Crap video editors .Ulead Video Studio. Videowave.. ....If you EVER buy a pinnacle product. make it this one. Then again I dont suggest buying a pinnacle product. Of the 3 ive used. only 1 has worked. 1 of 3 is not good. There are alternatives to Pinnacle! ....,3,0,996
A1Q4QC7PN8Z1CX,1518,In full disclosure this is the first eink reader I have ever owned.  That being said. Ive heard complaints from others about older models and have people at work compare their kindles to my nook touch and they think mine is sweet.  For me the size is perfect and once you play around with it. it is very easy to navigate.  It only has wi fi and no 3G but that may not matter to some.  Im very happy with it so far and my only real complaint is that the Bu0026N accessories are a little on the high side.  I mean really. youre paying 140 bucks for the reader. you shouldnt have to shell out USD30 for a case.  Other than that. I think its really cool and it doesnt have any of the web browsermp3 nonsense on it that sucks anyway on e readers.  If youre on the fence regarding e readers. go with this one and help keep book stores alive!!!,5,1,837
A1Q5M90ZZEEAL1,33,I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noisefree. pleasant air travel.  They fall short for two reasons.  The first is that they just dont cancel that much noise.  If youre not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off. its just not that great  partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this. the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H1000 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.  The second problem is that they generate noise of their own.  If its not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz.  So Id recommend either getting a pair of earplugs. or a set of headphones with a better seal.,3,0,814
A1Q6OAE55DIW6R,89,I ordered this so I could retrieve some photos of my boys from their younger years and I couldnt get it to work. the first one mad such a loud buzzing it hurt my ears and didnt work. then the company sent me another and the same . sad with the whole order. guess ill never get my photos. memories lost.,1,0,302

A1Q9H6HK893HTN,0,I found this drive to be an excellent source for reviewing my old floppy discs. and transferring then to cds. I have read several people say that it didnt work for them. At first I too. thought that it was non working. Ive used the drive on 3 computers. all having windows 7 operating system. Using the disc that came with the product. Worked on all 3. successfully.Once I figured out that all I needed to do was chose the right program for each disc according to the media stored on the disc everything is good now. I always safely remove my media when ejecting the disc from my computer. This made it so that I had to unplug and then plug back in each time for my computer to recognize the drive again. Probably something that Im doing. lol So I would say that operator error would be part of my problem. But. a little patience goes along way. Over all great device. I did get  charged more for shipping then stated in listing. during my transaction.,4,1,952

The polymer material is very easy to use  flexible. and holds its shape once you have melded it as desired. Overall. I like it. I considered a few other plastickycheap metal alternatives. but I decided on this Moleskine model as it just looks better made and more thoughtthrough. as a product.,4,1,583

A1QDBV9OI32OJY,12,After reading a number of other reviews here I had considerable trepidation about this speakers quality. but for under USD30 I was willing to gamble a bit. It turns out to work well for me with very good though not spectacular sound.Again. based on other reviews. I had already decided to avoid using the provided power supply and run it on batteries .and for my poolside application this is no real burden.. I note. however. that while the speaker itself runs on 12v DC the power supply I received prominently displays an output voltage of 18v.!.. If this is typical then its little wonder so many other people report hooking up and having their speaker run for only 30 seconds before going silent. With a 50% over voltage condition nobody should be surprised at circuits burning out.Overall. my impression is that the system is built to a price point and cuts corners every way possible. Expectations should be set accordingly. However. it works and seems to work pretty well .save for the glaring power supply problem. and Im quite satisfied with the result.,3,0,1061
A1QF9NX7O7XUNH,11,I bought two of these .24.95 with a 20.00 rebate. You get what you pay for!  Each modem was totally different. 1 worked fine. The other caused the PC to lose video and not boot up all the way up. The software and  instructions were different for each modem.  I exchanged the bad modem and  got a third different modem.

The new Palm IIIx didnt make it  through two days.Palm tech support says the u0026quotsolutionu0026quot to  lost data is a reset. Sure it isthat restores the unit to its factory  condition.

A1QPV43SWY9CGI,22,Not being a computer or camera u0026quotprou0026quot I needed something easy to use. I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon. I decided to buy the F83 model. This model allows for a 15 second u0026quotmovieu0026quot. Boy  do I like it. I like the ease of the Floppy disk. The quality is fine for  my needs. The battery lasts a long time. A camera bag is a necessity since  the LCD screen marks easily. I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a  digital camera that is easy to use.

Battery type is RBC2 for those wondering.Solid unit. having a telephone lineout and USB controller is a plus.,4,1,321
A1QTDEFXUKJ0MR,45,To start off I didnt buy this particular model. I bought the very first ATI AllInWonderPro that ATI first came out with. but looking at the technical data on this device. its pretty much the same thing but with more memeory for Video and DVD support.  Ill first list its good things.If you like doing interesting things with your computer like me. then this is defenitely one thing you should get.  This card gives you the services of Digital VCR. Digital Recorder. TV Tuner. Video Out mode. and DVD support.  With this one card that I have in my computer Im able to hook up my VCR to the card. and since my VCR has two Video inputs itself. I have an N64 and another VCR plugged into the computer.  All in all the card allows me to have two VCRs and the N64 plugged into the computer.  And this is all in digital quality.  You get amazing looking images from your videotapes or your games. seeing them like youve never seen them before.  It still amazes me how great my VHS tapes look when filtered through this card.  Then. I didnt even buy a monitor when I bought the computer tower.  Instead. knowing that this allows for VideoOut mode onto a TV. Im currently typying this on a 27inch TV monitor.  That definetely beats out the largest Computer monitor you can find on the market. Then. with the Digital VCR option Im able to record anything I want from the VCR onto my computer. including the TV channels my VCR outputs.  You may ask yourself. why would you do that when that takes up so much space and instead you can record it on tape.  Thats true. but with the VideoWave CDROM that came with card I can play around with the material that was recorded. editing it. putting in special effects. and eventually being able to output it back onto tape.  As for the DVD support. mine didnt come with that. but I imagine that all it is is just software.  You wont be able to play a DVD on your computer unless you have an actual DVDROM drive. then with this DVD support I imagine youll be able to do such things as record the DVD and play around with hit.Now for the setbacks.  Like some reviewrs mentioned earlier. there are some glithches that came with the card.  When I first installed it. the optioins to have Digital VCR. TV tuner. or Digital Recorder were never available.  The icons were simply not on the screen.  I contacted ATI. and again like the previous reviewrs mentioned. it takes a while for them to answer back. However when they did. they provided me with the information I needed to know to fix this. in simple idiotproof steps.  But still. it was a pain to try and figure out first why those options werent ready upon installation.  Secondly. that TVOut option is great. watching the computer display on the TV is defenitely better than on any smaller computer monitor. but only if you dont mind having the images slightly blurred.  Its not the cards fault. its the TVs.  Since most TVs do not have the high resolution as some computer monitors do. when you install this you may be asking yourself why some of the smaller letters look slightly blurred.  Games look great though. theres no impact there. but its only if youre reading something thats really small. like fine print.  That becomes a problem.  And thirdly. the Video memory.  Mine boasted 7MB. this one says 16MB.  If youre planning on doing some serious video editing. or setting your games on the highest possible standard. this just isnt enough.  On video. when youre storing video onto memory or retooling it. because of the small MB size this takes a while.  On games. the MB size is a joke.  If youre running games like HalfLife on the highest settings. be prepared to see alot of ping problems.  But then again this card wasnt meant for games specifically.  Something like Voodoo. or more SYNdram memory is better for that.  Im using the larger video memory that my computer came with myself.  Another memory problem is again not the cards fault.  If youre planning on doing some video editing or recording. be prepared to have some serious hard drive space for that.  Great looking recorded images take up a lot of space. but an alternative is that if you dont mind the Digital Recorder comes with several modes of compression. easing the memory it eats.So overall. I gave this four stars for its outstanding services that it provides. minus the one star for some of its glitches.  I highly recommend purchasing this as soon as possible if you want to do incredible things with your computer.,4,1,4482
A1QVML259ML93I,0,I am extremely dissatisfied with Kingston at this point. They are definitely not the memory company they once were. In the past eight months three mSDhc cards have failed. Granted Kingston replaced them under warranty. but still... Losing all the photos of your deceased soul mate is extremely traumatic at any given moment. these are irreplaceable. First my 64Gb .new out of the holder. would not properly format .TabLaptopDesktop  AndrLinuxWindows.. Now both my 32Gb have failed. both are dead and appear not to even power up. These were in different devices. but the failure is identical  dead. Class 10 devices should not fail within the first year of use. Unfortunately I will have to purchase some other vendors items to replace these Kingston memories as I do not trust them with my memories. Nor should you. Whether it is files to a thumb mSDhc or messagesapps u0026 photos on your phone. Do not trust them to Kingston.,1,0,927

A1QWYAWB1DRSQF,1,The Olympus D340R is. in my opinion. the best value digital camera available right now.The picture quality is impressiveI usually cant tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken  with a USD340 SLR that I have scanned in.Also. the camera is fairly  lightweight and compact and easy to use. like a good point and shoot camera  should be.Since I bought my Olympus. I have not taken 1 nondigital  photograph.  I enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from  developing and film costs .some USD10roll..Overall. the camera is worth  the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital  photography.,5,1,649

A1QXPYQYDWZ1NX,0,I purchased these speakers on a whim at PC Richard. without checking consumer reports or any other review services.  I connected them to my office computer and was impressed by the sound quality.  Coworkers had spent the equivalent on speakers that were truly inferior .small size. battery powered. tinny reproduction..  These Advents are quite powerful  I have yet to crank them past 12 power. and usually keep them at 14.  This is probably due to their relatively large size. and to the curved faces that seem to angle the sound directly at the user. One speaker has small dials that control volume. bass and treble.  There is also a mute button and a headphone jack.  There is an input for a subwoofer if you decide to add one.They also look very good with the standard beige desktop unit they resemble modern sculpture.  Plus. they are tough.  I dropped one of them while installingno damage. The guy who designed these put his heart into it.Bass reproduction could be improved. but without a subwoofer what do you expect? The Advent name badge seems flimsy. Thats it.  All in all. I dont understand how Advent is able to produce these speakers at this price point. They are a real pleasureI would be happy to bring these speakers home.,5,1,1240
A1QXUOIF8TORKC,33,After a 6 week wait. my Nook arrived.  I am bitterly disappointed in how the nooks functionality has been crippled and will return it. Hopefully Amazon. Sony and BN peruse these reviews and consumers may see some of the issues addressed.1. You cant manually set the clock.  BN assumes you will always have 3G access. If you travel or are out of a 3G area the time is wrong.  Seems like a small thing but it matters in a big way.  Not being able to manually set the clock is a genuine head scratcher.2. To drive consumers to the BN store and to the epub format BN has chosen to disallow basic functions with other supported document formats.  I am an academic and this matters to me. I have thousands of PDF docs on my computer and immediately transferred a couple of hundred to the Nook only to discover that I have no ability to search. sort or order document formats other than epubs. My PDFs exist on the Nook only as a dumb scrollable list. I cannot enter an author name or title and pull up the file. Neither can I alphabetize my PDF documents after they have been imported to the Nook.3. Following on from the above. BN has decided that while they will allow users to highlight. bookmark or make notes when reading they will not allow those functions if reading PDFs or any document format other than epubs.I cant perceive any logic in any of the above. Rather than having a satisfied customer who would come back to BN for epub purchases. I will have to return the nook because it doesnt offer basic functionality.,1,0,1521
A1QYB3PM0SWV4M,2337,Neat unit...  but for USD1000 youre halfway .or more. to a fullon laptop computer with DVDROM and FAR more functionality and power!  This is just too expensive for a DVDROM and ittybitty screen.  The value isnt there.  Spend the money on a laptop computer or. if you have one. buy a DVDROM  drive.  Youll thank yourself in the morning.  This unit will be worth USD100  or less in a year or two...  ouch!,1,0,403
A1QYOB73WONCYT,2735,My dad has data stored on floppies that he needs access to. but his new Windows 8.1 computer has no floppy drive. I didnt even know that USB floppy drives existed until I needed to find one. and this one seems to fit the bill.

A1QZ5FAJRCIRVM,11,Initially the camera worked fine.  Pictures were of good quality and all features worked fine.  After only a few months the cameras performance has dropped considerably.  Brand new batteries only last for about 12 pictures. the camera doesnt even power up at times even with new batteries. If you check the other reviews youll find equally frustrating problems others have had with the DC210.  Consumer Reports Nov 2002 issue contains Kodaxs repair history which speaks for itself. The same issue also provides excellent alternative cameras with superior features at much lower cost.  My advice.  Dont waste your hard earned cash on the overpriced. poor performing DC210.,1,0,671
A1QZMBCO1MWLQ5,15,This is a great camera if you dont have the money to buy an expensive one.  I was suprised how easy it is to set the camera up.

A1R1B3C8CFK4CZ,12,Not quite a fullfledged tablet. not a dedicated ereader...and thats OK with me for USD249!  I had my first two NookColors replaced. the first due to a SD card holder spring that failed after 90 days and the second due to an unresponsive touch screen and problems with powering on.  Customer service had me on the phone for about 45 minutes and took me through two factory resets before I finally convinced them to replace my second unit.  Note that all replacements of defective devices are refurbished. not new.  Finally. I am experiencing what Barnes u0026 Noble had in mind.  NookColor 3 works great and now that I have a unit with a touch screen that works as it should I am finally realizing what a great little machine this can be. with a really solid ereader and nice adds like Pandora and other apps. as well as wifi web browsing that really works well for a function that is secondary to the NookColors primary role as an ereader.  I really appreciate being able to listen to any selection from my iTunes library straight off the SD Card while reading or surfing the web or playing around with a couple of the apps I bought. Standard quality MP4 video files play smoothly. and most were converted to that format via third party software on my PC .My VideoConverter.. The app store is still underdeveloped and I really wish this had 3G capability so Id have an excuse for taking it with me more often. but at such a low price compared to 3G tablets. I have become very enamored of this machine.  The questionable quality control. a screen that is reflective in bright light and the weight of the device with cover are my only complaints. and if I had not encountered the quality problems I mentioned this would have been a solid 4 or 5Star review. especially considering the price vs. competing tablets .because it really is in the tablet category. especially with Android 2.2 froyo installed..,3,0,1902
A1R1BCR9N6OAIZ,33,This recorder at first was pretty good for the price. but the plug for the AC adaptor shorted. so I had to throw it out.  I probably had it for a little over a year and did not use it frequently. I did not drop or misuse it.  Im going to try the Panasonic next.,2,0,261

A1R2514DVWIIMV,0,Perhaps I misunderstood how to install the mount. but I.1. Installed the mount to the wall .easy enough.2. Attach TV the mount with some screws .difficult for one person.With one arm I held the TV .heavy!.. The other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the TV to the mount. It took quite an effort to hold the TV for that long. Certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier ..I have another similar mount where the TV back plate and the mount are separate parts. So once the back plate is installed. you slide the connecting parts together. Much easier! ..,4,1,595

A1R4YZGWS9176N,0,Ive been playing paintball for several years now and have been using the Motorola 250 with an earbudmic. The boom mic was to large and cumbersome to fit inside my paintball mask.With time comes upgrades so it was only natural that I would upgrade to the 289 with an earbudmic. With the range of the Motorola 289 and this you can easily stay in touch with your teammates and allow the other team to know if anything is going on. There is a slight discomfot when you first use the earbud however it does go away.Without the earbud I doubt I would hear the radio when someone was trying to get in contact with me. If your outside and want to stay in touch with your friends you need a Motorola and one of these. I gave this product 4 stars for its dependabilty and ease of use.***,4,1,777
A1R4YZGWS9176N,2122,Ive been playing paintball for several years now and have been using the  Motorola 250 with this earbudmic. I havent had any problems with it. The  boom mic was to large and cumbersome to fit inside my paintball mask. As  for the earlier reviews which complain about the VOX system in wind and  background noise. the easy solution is to deactivate the VOX and use the  radio as a standard push to seak radio using the earbud and inline  microphone to speak and listen.With the range of the Motorola 250 and  this you can easily stay in touch with your teammates and allow the other  team to know if anything is going on. Playing in the woods all day causes  you to sweat and my earbud cover has not disintegrated. Ive even cleaned  it from time to time. The inside of paintball masks has a similar foam  around the goggles.  I clean mask everytime I play and the foam hasnt  disintegrated either.There is a slight discomfot when you first use the  earbud however it does go away.Without the earbud I doubt I would hear  the radio when someone was trying to get in contact with me. I gave this  product 4 stars for its dependabilty and ease of use.,4,1,1147
A1R59N965DZU0L,68,Im here reading reviews trying to figure how I can email my photos. I  hoping maybe its just the SORRY software program that came with the camera.

Tried  polaroid tech. have to say they were no help what so ever!Ive got a few  ideas from other reviews to try when I get home that will hopefully work.  One thing for sure I did learn was I need to go purchase rechargable  batteries.Unless some of your suggestions work the camera is going back  to the store Monday.All its been is one big headache!!,2,0,568
A1R5GO02AP6C12,13,I just got the Diamond Rio. It is a wonderful product. heres why . What do you strive for in a MP3 player ? Good sound. Space for music. compactness. cool look. competitive pricing. and I can honestly say that  the Rio 500 meets each of these qualities. The sound is barely  distinguishable from a true CD. Unless your are a true audiophile you will  not be able to tell the difference. UNLESS you like listening to music  REALLY LOUD. then you might be able too find a small distortion in the MP3  version. The 500 can also hold a lot of songs. because it is 64 Megs and  also you can transfer your songs because of its USB connection. It looks  great! It is also the size of a pager. AND IT DOESNT SKIP! This product is  worth its price. This maybe the last u0026quotpure mp3u0026quot model available  because after christmas the SDIC will be putting a detector which wont let  you download free mp3s unless explicity stated by the musician. SO GET EM  NOW! It only takes one AA batteria for 12 hrs of playback which is pretty  good. The LCD is a very nice neon blue. The only problem with this product  are the bad earphones. Contrary to one of the reviewers I believe it is  quite easy to install. I didnt read the manual. Just plug it into your USB  port . IMPORTANT YOU NEED A USB PORT TO RUN IT .and then windows  automatically asks you for the driver cd. then you pop it in restart your  computer and Viola! Dont ponder the value of this product too long because  before you know it they will be Sold OUT! Happy Listening! Cheers,5,1,1537
A1R602SXNGOMJ4,5455,What a great little camera!!  I got this for Christmas last year and since its so small.. I take it with me wherever I go.  The picture quality is great.

A1R6I0ZLP8M2C9,11,I bought this unit because it was sold specifically for the 765T GPS.  When plugged in the computer connection screen came up and now wont go away.  Now I cant turn it off and the computer connection screen is up all time.  If you value your GPS. dont buy this charger.,1,0,269
A1R7CQ8PFI1X2X,1111,This radio arrived and Im very satisfied with the functions the radio provides.  The rechargeable battery pack has some kind of issue. With the rechargeable pack on. no power makes it to the radio.  Using the standard pack or the auto power jack it works fine.I bought this radio specifically to use on my motorcycle.  The thing that tipped me finally over the top is the separate earphone jacks and microphone jack on this unit.  I route all audio through a preamp and them into ear buds rather speakers near my ears.  Ive found I can hear much better with the ear buds.  Many portable systems. Id even say most have a combined audio out and microphone jack .1..  This unit has separate and this allows me to use my preamp.  Im looking forward to next years trips on the bike with my new CB tied in with my gps and IPOD.  Stylin now!,4,1,834

A1R9QOPV6HVEKF,0,This RIO model is a nifty music device.  Compact size. fantastic sound quality. no skipping. and easy transfer of music from a computer.  On the other hand. it only holds six or seven songs. the door on the battery case  doesnt stay shut so well after a few months of use. and a little abuse.  and the u0026quotholdu0026quot switch gets sticky after a while and becomes  difficult to move.  If you can find it on the cheap its a cool toy.  otherwise wait for a newer model or get some other technology to fire up  your tunes.,3,0,525
A1RAHXEOHEHDC2,2,Ive had my 5mx for a year now and I love it.  The native applications are great. the OS is very stable. the batteries last. and the keyboard is the best Ive seen. etc. etc.However. I thought it would be more interesting to highlight some of the nonstandard things you can do.o  For truly mobile email. I use an Ericsson sh888 which connects via an  infrared link.  Works in Europe and Far East. For the US you would need a  different phone .triband?..o Routplanner gives you  mobile maps and route planning.  Add on a GPS .I use an old Garmin GPSII+.  and the map follows your position  this is a superb package which really  works well in the car. I attach the GPS to the dashboard with velcro and  the 5mx connects with a cable. Now that the GPS signal is no longer  degraded. the accuracy is good enough for street level navigation.o You  can swap compact flash cards with a suitable digital camera  and send them  as attachments to an email.  I use a Kodak DC240. Great for postcards.o  The Opera webbrowser is just out and will get you onto  your hotmail account and other sites that require SSL security.  I  personnally only use the web on the move when I need to retrieve specific  pages. because portable phones are still too slow for true browsing.  You  could of course get the infrared modem which gives you 50k when connected  to a landline.,5,1,1354

A1RE2QZZKXREQJ,0,The circular disc inside the unit that cleans the cd has a very thin and narrow strip of cloth attached to foam on it.  Even the least amount of pressure when cleaning a cd will leave scratches on the cd.  This is because the clothfoam piece is easily pushed inside the plastic circle. and that plastic on the circle ends up touching the cd and scratching it while you are cleaning it.  I recommend using cd cleaners that have wide and thick cleaning pads that cannot be pushed into the object holding it.  Ive also noticed that the wider pads clean the cds better and dont get dirtyworn out as quickly as the thin. narrow ones do. My personal favorite is the Scotch Disc Cleaner.,2,0,680

A1RFYCSNNOJ0VW,8383,These Teac drives are great. I have them for about 2 months and no problems. Just remember  No cable comes with purchase so make so you have a cable.,4,0,149
A1RFYCSNNOJ0VW,3948,Paying .little cash.. I was not expecting a great deal of volume from this speakers. Consider this. some cheap non amplified speakers cost near USD15 dollars and for double that price. you would expect about double the quality. Well. let me tell you. this baby more than quadtriples the sound of those speakers.The Creative labs PC WORKS 1000 system comes complete with the 2 satelitte cubes. the subwoofer. power adapter. audio inputer cable. mounting stands. velcro attachments and screws. Installation was very easy. just plug the speakers in the back of the sub. plug in the power adapter in the power source and the audio cable in the sub and the source.The included manual is quite small but is adequate enough to help you set up and get the system running. They have recommendations on placement and volume. I plugged my system into a discman first. When I first turned it on I was amazed at the power of the bass. The OOMPHS really shocked me.Concerning the volume. this is one of the problems I have with the system. First off. the volume is somewhat hard to find the appropriate setting. .There is a bass adjustmant on the sub and a volume control on the audio cable. Finding a balance in bass and treble is quite hard. When the bass level is at 50% .as set when you first get the system.. the bass tends to overpower the treble at lower volumes while the treble overpowers the bass at high volumes. Solving this problems involves alot of tweaking and depends on the type of music you listen to.My second problem with this system is the supplied velcro strips. These were supposed to be used to mount to a wall. I was obviously skeptical at the concept but I tried it anyway. About 3 days after mounting them to the wall. on one of the speakers. the velcro pad unstuck from the speaker so the speaker fell. After resticking it. almost a day later. the velcro pad stuck to the wall unstuck so the other speaker fell. After this happened. it is obvious that the actual sticking surface which attaches to the wallspeaker is too weak. not the velcro. If you decide to use the velcro. let the pads stick to the surfaces for atleast 2 days before mounting the speaker to the wall.Those 2 problems are my only ones. other than that the volume is excellent. You will be suprised about the amount of volume you can get from this system. Its hard to explain....hear the sound. you will be amazed.....In conclusion. if you think about it. the cost of these speakers warrant it to be a typical speaker system for any computer and can easily be used for a small home theatre system. The speakers are magnetically shielded so you can mount them to your monitor. If you got extra cash and you want neighbours 2 or 3 houses down the road to hear you. consider pumping out that cash for a more expensive system. But for regular people like me on a budget. this system is an excellent solution for any sound need.,4,1,2905
A1RG4WKNMPYS4X,22,I built my PC and added this monitor about 3 years ago. Its still performing just as well as it did when i bought it. Its easy to learn to use .as far as video adjustments like horizontalvertical and pincushioning.. displays colors really well. and is easy to get drivers for. I tend to update my drivers once every 6 months or so since there seems to always be a newer one available. I run Win2K with a Voodoo 3 video card. Its a more than adequate monitor at the cheap end of the spectrum. I paid USD250. but nowadays you shouldnt pay more than USD150 for a new one.,4,1,568
A1RGVCDAZL1MWK,0,I was given on older GPS unit without a wall charger. This charges fast.

A1RIK8B9P23U1W,1,Ive only used it a few times and its never been in a place where it probably wouldve been stolen anyway. I still use it because on the off chance it could disappear. its worth the minute it takes me to get this cable out and put it on. The first time I put it on it felt and sounded like it was scraping the inside of the laptop. but I didnt worry too much about it and it hasnt been a problem. Now that its been on a couple times it goes on easily every time. Just have to get the Tbar twisted until it lines up with the dots by pressing the key in and turning. then stick it in. turn the key 90 degrees. pull it out. and done. Long enough I havent ever had a problem finding something to loop the cable around.,4,1,712

A1RJTWUR7DXKUN,0,PalmV is very easy to use.  I spent only a couple of days to fully utilize the machine.  A lot of addon programs you can download later on.  It really reminds all my busy schedule.  Very good for anyone who has lots of  meetings. A little downside. once in a while I seem to have problem with  very slow battery charging.,4,1,321
A1RLP0R1N8H8C4,912,We use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does.  So far this little rechargable hasnt needed a recharge u0026 is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out u0026 then back on while were sleeping.  I gave it 4 stars because we havent had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just given.,4,1,376
A1RMIFPUBF7EXH,11,I was quite pleased with my headphones. which I purchased midjanuary to  use in my dorm room.  They were somewhat uncomfortable with extended use .2  hours or so.. but they felt pretty good. and I never had a problem with  sound quality. A few days shy of the end of the year. the plastic on the  unchorded side split cleanly in two. for no apparent reason.  However. for  15 bucks. AND with a lifetime.!. warranty. I still highly recommend these.  I just ordered a nicer pair of sony open air ones. but these served me  well.,4,1,526
A1RNBZEIMXSBZZ,14,I was not happy with this product.  It did not work properly. door would not open and close.  Product came without proper cables.  I spent USD14 to send this product back.

A1RNIAD5OPGLG,1,Ordered this because I had a Kindle that didnt have 3G. I like the method of reviewing items to order on Barnes u0026 Noble and I like the reading surface of the Nook better than the Kindle.  I prefer the Kindle for ease and quickness of ordering. for its lighter weight and the lightness of the page turning buttons.  I know have the Kindle with 3G  but will use both inner changeably.  I let my granddaughter use my original Kindle.,4,1,434
A1RNNIGB4CE8MH,0,Ill start off by saying the Marble FX isnt for everyone. That said. I will say it is one of the easiest input devices to use and maintain. The large trackball takes getting used to. but once you do. youll never want  to use a traditional mouse again. Using the trackball requires only the  movement of your fingers. and not your wrist. I found myself resting my  wrist and palm along the curved lower portion. You can use your thumb and  forefinger to gain accurate control of the pointer on the screen.  Maintenance is easy. I usually pop the marble out and clean it and wipe the  socket clean with a cloth. Theres never any worry about lint jamming it  since there are no moving parts. The marble sits on several hard plastic  contacts and is the only thing that moves. If you have limited deskspace or  are suffering from a sore back or shoulder. Id highly recommend this  device.,5,1,883
A1RNTCN7T1EKXZ,1414,If youve never had an SVHSVCR.as most people have not.this would be a good one tohave.Super VHS is an improvedversion of VHS and nearly doubles the picture quality!All SVHS decks also record and playback ordinary VHS  too.Actually this deck supportsthree formats VHS.SVHS.andSVHS ET.SVHS ET  .ET standsfor expansion technology.notextra terrestial!. allows oneto use  ordinary VHS tapes tomake SVHS recordings.If youuse veryhigh quality VHS  tapes.your results will beclose to fullfledged SVHS!You will lose only 2  to 4 %picture quality as opposed tousing higherprice SVHS tapes.SVHS ET  works best forS.P. .standard play. speedrecording.If you want to makeE.P.  .extended play. tapes.Ireccomend you use SVHS tapes.Super VHS at E.P.  speed looksbetter than regular VHS doesat S.P. .hands down! This VCRwill  make tapes off sateliteand digital cable that areatleast close to the  originalbroadcast.unlike ordinary VHS.the difference isnt obvious!This  deck is featureladden too.It has VCR Plus +.which takes about a halfhour  to setup but allows you to program very quickly via the VCR Plus + codes  found in most all TV guides.If you program using the onscreen menu.thats  easy too!On the remote the keys used for programing are inside a linedoff  area and steps are numbered on the remote so its hard to make a  mistake.Other notable features include automatic clock set. if your PBS  station is doing this service..automatic clock adjust for daylight savings  time.multibrand TV control.and skip search .each push of the button  fastforwards your tape thirty seconds.I think you know why!..The remote is  an excellent design in the best JVC tradition.Other VCR manufacturers  should copy their remotes.theyre that good! With todays improved video  sources like DBS.SVHS recording is the ticket! You can buy just any VHS  recorder real cheap.but if you want a really good one.pay a little more for  this unit.,4,1,1910
A1RNX9KTD903Z2,2830,This was my first ever digital camera and once I had it out a couple of hours and found myself looking for more batteries! Operation is very simple and easy to use. However. it comes with the smallest available memory card and I suggest buying a 128mb card...Well worth the money for extended .more than 12. hires pictures. At this point. my LED stopped working. The cost is almost as much as the camera. so. Im buying a new Fugi 5.0 mega pixel. The image quality difference is mindblowing. Spend the extra money and buy at least a 2.0 mega pixel camera with the extra toys that dont come with the cheaper cameras. If the camera doesnt come with the ACadapter for home or the additional battery pack keep looking for one that does. The alternative is pulling a wagon behind you full of batteries.,3,0,796

A1ROW7BZCQZAC2,1332,I like the system. its a perfect size and its appearance isnt blocky or  tacky like most systems.  However.

A1RPTVW5VEOSI,3132,The ETX is in many ways a marvelous little scope. Optically. its far and above most 90mm catadioptric scopes. like the Celestron 90. Mechanically. though. it leaves a bit to be desired. There are a few too many flimsy  plastic parts. the clock drive is not terribly accurate. and the drive  clutch has way too much slop in it.The human engineering aspect leaves a  lot to be desired as well. The finder scope is almost impossible to use as  set up. The mount makes it impossible to view though the scope or finder in  many orientations.  What Meade tried to do here is create a clone of the  USD4.000 Questar at a bargain price. Optically theyve done well .though it  still falls short of a Questar. but in copying the mechnical design opf the  Questar they had to leave out precisely those details that make the Questar  such a pleasure to use.The USD599 price is a little misleading. While  designed for tabaletop use. unless you have a cast concrete tabletop youll  need a solid tripod to support it. so you can add another USD150 right there.  bringing the actual cost to more like USD749. And for that price there are a  lot of good choices around. They make not look as slick. but theyre a lot  more usable.,3,0,1213
A1RPTVW5VEOSI,8789,Its big. its bulky. and you cant carry it while youre roller blading. but the GE Superradio has the best AM and FM reception of just about ANY  portable radio on the market. short of a USD500 Lowe. Its especially valued  for its sensitive AM reception .its a favorite of AM broadcast band  u0026quotDXersu0026quot chasing distant stations. but the FM reception is nearly  as good. Spend some time listening to it in the evening and youllbe amazed  how many AM stations are out there that you never suspected existed.After I loaned mine to a builder friend working on my house. he ran out  and bought one his old job site radio just couldnt get his favorite  stations. He listens to it at home now. too. For the money theres just  nothing else that even comes close.,5,1,765
A1RPTVW5VEOSI,4747,This is a generic Pacificrim made prism imported by Meade. and not terribly different from similar items sold by Celestron. Orion and other popular companies catering to amateur astronomers. Its a useful accessory  for nature viewing. but dont try to use it for star gazing.  Because of  how theyre constructed. with multiple reflecting surfaces. erecting  diagonals lose a lot of light. something you cant afford when looking at  distant. dim images. Worse. they produce ghost images for every star or  planet. youll see a dim twin nearby. Save it for daylight use. and youll  have no problem.,4,1,594
A1RPTVW5VEOSI,1241,I bought the Smile to have a handy. inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages. I didnt want to spend USD400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months. I figured for USD100 I couldnt go wrong. I was mistaken.The Smile just has too many compromises. The lens is a tiny fixedfocus item that requires bright light to form an image. Battery life is abysmal it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures. I should have spent USD200 and gotten a far better camera.,1,0,481
A1RQG5UIBSBK2V,1031,The RCA RC 920 that Amazon sells bundled with the RCA RC 930 are not compatible.  Call Audiovox. the actual manufacturer. at 8004095111 to confirm.  The RC 930 works fine.  The RC 920 is worthless.,2,0,197
A1RR8ZVMBHQFIJ,0,I purchased the Kindle 1. then a BeBook .because it reads PDFs.. and now a Kindle DX for the TextToSpeech. The Nook looks so cool. until you own one. Heavy copy protection. even on PUBLIC DOMAIN books is ridiculous. And. from what I am reading on the web. the books are encoded with a persons credit card  and other personal info. So ... hackers can rejoice if I loose my Nook.Anyway. books are still cheaper on Amazon.The color touch screen is cool. until you realize that it takes up SOOOO much of the reading area and ... costs battery!Maybe next year. the nook will be ready for prime time.,1,0,594

A1RV27V0ZGOM6Q,0,I got this camera as a christmas gift and have been using it 12 hours per week since then with no problems.  I also purchased a firewire editor .studio dv. and it works great with the PV 910 allowing titles. sound  effects. non linear editing and much more.  I love the light included with  the camera and the sizeweight.  I highly recommend it.,4,1,345
A1RWI7T9KNVORT,2022,I purchased this product to connect my TIVO without having to install a second phone line. The installation was pretty simple. but when I plugged in a simple telephone set to test the line at the site where my TIVO was. the line noise was significant. When I plugged in the phone cord to my TIVO and tried to connect. the connection failed. I then contacted customer service to figure out what was wrong. and after troubleshooting the service attendent asked me if I had DSL on the line. I told her yes. and she informed me that the excessive noise on the line was due to the DSL. The wireless jack will not work with a DSL line! I was stunned! Why is there is no mention of this on the packaging or documentation?!?!? It looks like time to make a service call to the dreaded phone company to install a phone jack. Bad product. and bad documentation.,2,0,850

A1RX0PONTT2ZL7,45,I love the nook tablet!!!! The only problem I had was from the place the tablet came from. never sent the order as stated. I had to email amazon to locate my shipment.

A1RXKNLMW3F1ZM,0,While the hard case has protected my palm from a couple of falls onto hard pavement. it obviously wasnt designed by the same folks who designed the cradle. Moreover it has a fundamental design flaw that I find extremely frustrating. you can only put the palm in one way  so that it opens in typical book fashion. In other words. the slider on the hard case will only go into the slot on the left edge of the palm. This is caused by two features of the front face. it is slightly deeper. and it has milled areas for the buttons. How hard would it have been to make the case symmetric so you could mount the palm the other way?Why I would like to mount the palm the other way? Well. the obvious way to mount it is the way the case is designed for. book style. The less obvious but *superior* way for a righthanded person is to have the case mounted in the right edge slot. This makes it much easier to hold the palm with your left hand. and in addition it allows you to operate the palm with your right hand solo by holding the open face of the case against your knee. If you are righthanded and dont believe me. try putting the palm in the hard case slider into the right slot so it opens from the back. .You can install it this way it just wont close properly because of the flawed design.. Now open it. grab the stylus in your right hand. put the right flap of the case on your knee. and put your hand down on it to hold it. Youll see how much easier it is to operate. Now try holding the palm in your left hand and youll see that its easier to operate in this fashion also.Now dont misunderstand me to be saying the case should be designed for righthanded people. Im saying it should be designed so that you can mount the palm from either side so that both right and lefthanded people can use it comfortably. The current design is better for southpaws. I guess theres some sort of poetic justice there.,2,0,1904
A1RZW5AHNQ66H2,2,Reading on the Nook is easy. especially for those of us who read in bed.The text is clear. adjustments are simple for any eye.I still prefer a real print book to the ereader. but with limited space. the Nook is the answer to having a lot of books to read without having to buy another house.I have a problem getting the Nook and my pc to play together nicely. but time and experience will solve this eventually.,4,1,411

A1S3TON0L88AG0,25,I bought my palm while in Brazil. dropped it off a ladder. called customer service. had a likenew reconditioned one and a paidfor return mailer in 24 hours.  Back in the states I ran it over with my truck. .it still worked  but had some screen trouble.. called customer service and once again I got  a likenew one in 24hrs.  That one broke and because the original was more  than a year old I had to pay USD100 for the same great service once again.,4,1,449
A1S400D6Z2LIH6,1621,After my old Kodak at work gave up the ghost. I read some reviews. including yours. and decided on the Agfa CL30. Shortly after installing the software in the computer and connecting the camera. the batteries got very hot and it ceased working permanently. The first .and only. pictures I took were of far greater quality than my old digital camera. In other words. while it was working. I was very pleased. But obviously. there are some quality problems,3,0,454
A1S41XZ9CXH725,4451,This was advertised as for a Samsung Rugby.  The connector to the phone does not fit.  It looks like the correct size plug. but it will not connect.  Apparently. there is an insert internal to the connector that will not allow it to plug into the phone.  It does not work with my phone and was not advertised with any restrictions.,2,0,331
A1S43AJ24LNR93,0,As is apparent through previous reviews. many people are displeased with the quality of this item.  I am one of those people.  While I was certainly not expecting an elaborate. handcrafted. bulletproof Palm fortress. I was expecting a little more than a cheap plastic coat that feels like it came out of a vending machine.  This would make a great USD7.95 item.  It makes a terrible USD3040 item.The plastic .the primary material of construction. supplemented by a thin layer of aluminum. probably feels more delicate than it really is.  But at the same time. who wants to spend that much money on something just to test and see if it really is stronger than it feels?  For me. the case never closed properly. and if there is some kind of ingenious spring mechanism. it certainly doesnt work on the case I bought.All in all. I found this case to be of uncharacteristically low quality for Palm. and feel the money was completely wasted.  I do see very limited use for this case. such as people who really do like to take their Palm into hazardous environments where its likely to get banged around by heavy objects. or something of that sort.  But for the average Palm user. this gadget is really more trouble than its worth. and in the end. will only serve to diminish the convenience of the Palm.,2,0,1298
A1S5QVS3YLY6FK,22,I ordered a longer version of this exact cable last year to connect my cable modem to my desktop computer. I was so impressed with the make and quality of it that when I bought a Valet router. I decided the cat 5 cable supplied with it was not up to the standard I expected. I bought the 3 foot one to connect my router to the modem. I really wasnt expecting much as far as improved performance. but I am keeping a full wifi signal on my phone now. while previously only having 2 of 3 bars showing up. Could be the shorter cord. could be better quality. Im not really one to say since Im no pro with these things. but it has improved my routers signal. One piece of advice. if youre using more than one get a different color. I wasnt thinking and prefer the blue cord. so I ended up with two blue cords that are going to the same product. Since I do occasionally plug my modem directly into the PC instead of through the router. I ended up having to color a black mark on the one cord so I know which is which. The snagless feature on these works really well and was the biggest concern I had with the cable that came with the router since I could already see the clip starting to wear from unplugging it and plugging. Wouldnt usually write a review for a cord. but this one has enough going for it that I think it deserves all the praise it can get.,5,1,1350
A1S6B5QFWGVL5U,34,Works well. a little pricey I think for a charging cable. but then again. not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement,4,0,141
A1S6MB867Q8B8S,22,I was skeptical and unsure whether I should order this wall mount but after reading the reviews I decided to take a chance. I figured I have nothing to lose.

A1S7939NNQGLP8,0,While the sound quality on the MPMan is quite good. the setup can be a nightmare.  The documentation for the MPMan is spartan at best and totally useless at worst.  The customer support line is basically an answering  service involving hours of phone tag and mixed messages.

A1S7ZHV3VCF4IQ,0,This cb radio is the most awesome cb Ive ever owned! And iv owned a lot of them since the 1970s! This is so easy to go from totally hand held to a  mobile cb and the sound quality is better than my BIG radio!! Just be sure you match it with your antenna when using it as mobile! As with ALL cb radios this is a must do!! There are good swr meters on amazon .or elsewhere if you prefer.Like just about any truck stop or RadioShack.I would definitely recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a new and very versatile cb radio!! Happy CBing!!  UPDATE. If using in a big rig you may want to use an external speaker with it. I could still hear but found myself straining a bit.It takes all of about 2 seconds to plug in a ext.speaker and well worth it.I also use a retractable Mic.keeper .hooked to belt clip.to quickly install in truck.,5,1,841

A1S8BIA04QYPTA,11,My replacement nook simple touch just died.  This is the second to die in less than a year.  Always the same reason ... cant charge the battery ... or rather the battery looses its charge in about 2 days.  This is a long ways from the advertised battery life.  I did all the usual things. like disabling wifi. and nothing seems to help.  So. essentially a battery is good for about 1 to 2 charges before it refuses to hold a charge.I really enjoy the device but cant see myself replacing an eReader every 4 months.  So. I gave the NST a score of 3 star. because its a nice and easy to use eReader.  Reliability issues is a deal breaker for me.  There has to be something more reliable than a nook.,3,0,697

A1SAQB40R8C44A,44,I owned a Palm III for a while when it came out. and then stepped up to the V after about a year with my III. What can I say? I was allured by its sexiness and general asthetic appeal.I have now relied on it for about a  year for all my organizing needs. I have used every part of the Palm  Software suite except the expense reporting feature.While I like the  Palm Vs style. I have become more and more disappointed by its features  and memory issues.Features. lacks decent sound for starters. a beep is  boring and weak. When I carry the Palm in its home .my pocket. I cannot  hear the alarm tones even with volume maxed! The screen is a mixed bag.  While its clarity is better than other organizers. it is very hard to read  in slightly dim areas because the backlighting leaves a lot to be desired.  Battery power is okay. but not anywhere near the advertised time of 30  days.Memory is a whole different issue. All I have on my palm is some  1500 addresses and 1000 calendar entries and it tells me I am half full. as  you know they advertise a lot more capacity. I don use but a couple of  aftermarket programs.The Graffiti recognizer is crap. When it works it  puts the wrong letters on the screen. Real users need to get Jot! from  CiC.Palm. Inc.s tech support is the WORST! Most of their support staff  can hardly speak English so imagine them trying to explain a highly  technical issue! Whats more. they dont even care. I was pormised a return  call  had to call back. I have not once ever received a real response by  email  only autoresponders that say u0026quot2448 hoursu0026quot  still  waiting on my inquiry from January!In short. save a little longer and  get the Cassiopeia E115 .when it comes out.. In my experiences with  headtohead comparrisons of Cassiopeia E105s to my Palm V. the Cassio was  a true frontrunner! The E115 will certainly be even better! If you need a  great datebook and address book to keep you straight and dont need sound.  memory. genuine Word Processing. or Spreadsheet. or color screen then GO  WITH THE PALM V!  But if you need features and real performance. get a  Windows CE Device.,3,0,2131

A1SF59X4FDUGQG,23,I bought this because of the duality of its nature.  It can be used as a walkie talkie. with either 6 regular AA batteries or 8 rechargeable batteries which can be charged while in the radio!!Or you can plug it into your vehicle power point and use it with .... just about any kind of cb antenna you may choose.  Just make sure you check the SWR or have someone do it for you if cant do it yourself!!Good sound quality. both as a CB and as a weather radio.AND. when I got it. from the used department at Amazon .bad idea.. it was a couple of weeks before I was able to try the rechargeable base to see if it worked. Everything else did. but this item did not. Having hassled with Amazons chat function a couple times. I wasnt in the mood to deal with them again. so. a quick email to Midland got me a replacement rechargeable battery box that DID work. no charge. no hassle. 3 days in the mail and Im VERY impressed with Midlands customer service.

A1SK0GBODI5VMU,0,I just was not able to hear clearly. I was disappointed. especially because I bought what I thought was a topoftheline product.,1,0,127
A1SKNNDCWOFA0I,0,This item is relatively easy to setup if you have a decent understanding of computer hardware.  For most systems it requires changing irqs in the bios.  The provided documentation is terrible and the software is mediocre.  The unit itself however. in my opinion. provides better sound quality than  a rio.,4,1,305
A1SKUEZ2TNLZK3,33,Out of the box use. great speed. Shipping was prompt. and secure. Another great product for a great price. I will be doing more business in the near future.,5,0,156
A1SL5FHOMDDY15,44,Well. it has taken three weeks and three different online companies to get the Palm V to me.  Was it worth the wait?  You bet...although its a bit pricey due to the shortage of flash ram and LCD screens.  After filling up  my address book. downloading email and news .through AvantGo.. as well as  various applications and games I still have about 768K left.  2MB may seem  like a small amount of storage to some people. but it goes a long way as  long as you manage your email. games. and amount of AvantGo channels you  read.  The HotSync operation only takes a few minutes. and I spent a total  of five minutes learning the alphabet and numbering system of the graffiti  language.  Once fully charged. the battery never seems to diminish no  matter how much I use it.  Even though the Palm V did not come with a nice  checkbook program. I found a free one immediately at download.com.  Now  that the US version is sold out in most places. I would highly recommend  considering the international version as it seems like it is virtually the  same as the US version with an international AC adapter.,5,1,1100
A1SNT83NFD4U8N,23,Its an ethernet cable.  Its fifty feet long.  It works.Need more?  Well. I like that the plastic molding at the connectors doesnt slide down the cable.Still need more?  Buy it if you need it.,5,0,191

A1SPGYWZUX7ANK,0,This is a great product for the price.  Yes. the batteries drain a little fast if you use the LCD screen too much.  The resolution isnt professional quality. but it works for the average user.  If you get an 8 MB SmartMedia card. you can take tons of pictures.  Good lighting is a must  a lot of my indoor pictures havent turned out too good because of dim lighting.  I guess the flash is a little weak.  Also. weve had a problem with the LCD screen  it stopped working after only a couple months.  We had fresh batteries and all. the screen just quit on us.  My mother in law had the same problem. but Polaroid replaced the camera for her .she just had to pay for shipping it..  Were working on that right now.  Recommend a Flash Path 3.5 floppy adapter  it works great for transfering files without messing with cables or anything.,3,0,833
A1SPZ6C21SN6IL,44,I wrestled between SONY and the Toshiba DVD players for a couple months!  I finally went with Sony.  I trust the name and my insincts were correct again! I must say all the reviews I read right here on Amazon  about both  players were of enormous help!  Thanks everyone!  Had it up and running in  5 nimutes.  Flawless performance!  No problems with any dvd so far and do  not expect any.  Quality .and nicely setup. remote.  I cant say much more  without repeating what everyone else said but you will not be let down by  the Sony S330.  The price is right!  The free Netflix rentals were great  too!  DVD RENTALS shipped to my door with no late fees...prepaid  mailers...you never have to leave your couch! Any questions if your  browsing. give a holler! .tjhale@webtv.net.,5,1,775
A1SQOEKFCAHY8I,3030,I got this from HSN on easy pay todays special for only USD249. No bugs and super fast. There is free Wifi everywhere so why pay for 3G. if its really 3G. The color is amazing and the screen is super fast when scrolling. I have an Iphone 4s so if I need a camera to do skype. Ill use my phone. In the meantime. this supports Flash. I was considering getting the Ipad 3 thats coming out this March. but Apple refuses to partner with Flash. Why pay over USD1K if no flash? Unless Apple does a giant leap in tablets. Ill stick with the Nook tablet.,5,1,545

A1SS291G5X84WC,0,The wall mount did not come with extenders for larger TVs. It is pictured with extenders and no where in the listing does it say they are not included and must be purchased separately.  Not very pleased with purchase.,2,0,217
A1SSL3RR30E0XE,2,I truthfully searched for like 4 weeks trying to find a suitable case for my Palm Vx.  I went through the Dooney u0026amp Bourke Bayou Case. the targus Wallet and even used the standard screen flip cover that came with the Palm before I settled for this.I hate to use the term settled. but this has become my case by default.  Ive had this case for about 2 weeks now and am growing into it. so to speak.People who say that this is overpriced are correct.  While the Hard Case appears to be amde of some strong metal alloy in the pictures. the fact is that it is merely sleek. silvery plastic which is no more structurally sound than a CD jewel box.  After about 2 weeks of use. the hinge on the front cover appears to be wearing down. so Im a little concerned by that.  And trying to HotSynch with the case on is tricky. but manageable.The slickness of the outer shell does make the unit difficult to manage sometimes.What I like about the case is that it does offer some protection. at least more than the flip cover that came with the Palm. Since buying this case. Ive dropped my Palm twice. and the case has held up.  Its certainly not as strdy or solid as the Rhino Case. but its held up so far.Also. unlike the Targus Wallet. the case really doesnt add much at all to the overall size of the Palm.  It still fits very conveniently in my coat pocket.  That is a big positive for me.I may change my mind about this case and really grow to like it. Like I said. there are some positives.  But right now Im using it out of default more than anything.,3,0,1551
A1SSRTHZNF270V,99,Belkin CAT5 cables are by far the best ones that I have owned. I have bought from both them and Amazon and this gets an extra star because it has a clip that holds it in the port on your computer or wall. I cant stand losing internet connection in the middle of watching a movie because I decided to move my laptop. This cable is also of a higher quality than most others. so far none that I own have frayed or split at the end through constant twisting and pulling. I highly recommend this over the AmazonBasics one. the extra dollar will save you many annoyances.Cheers.,5,1,572
A1STGBZGT67XMP,0,This is a great camera!  So much you can do with your photos using your computer.  The floppy disc is the way to go  so fast u0026amp simple.  My only criticism is the packaging by Sony.  The adapter for the battery plug  had rolled over to a corner of the box and I couldnt find it until I  started to put everything back in the box...even tho there were 10  instruction books in every language. the English language directions were  vague and you had to use your own computer savvy to know how to  u0026quotformatu0026quot your floppys. plus there wasnt a warranty card  enclosed. but I contacted Sony via email and received one in the mail.  But. other than those inconveniences. the camera itself is wonderful.  Good  quality pictures and excellent color u0026amp fun. fun. fun!,4,1,782

A1SW1CR2I316PR,0,This is good for you if you want a cheap CD holder for the car or just to get them out of the way but it is not that stable. If your more concerned  about the price that the quality then buy it. Its really small so you  cant fit that many CDs in it if you want the CD booklets in there with  them. Also another thing I dont like about it is that it dosnt have a  spot for your CD player which is a notible feature in a CD case.,3,0,427

A1SWTPMI6741JA,0,Remote send out IR as well as RF to the transponder which sends out IR.  It controlls my Sony STRDA555ES. Toshiba 50u0026quot. Panasonic A120U. Akai and Panasonic HiFi VCRs.  This remote exceeded my expectations for  functionality .PiPinputmenu for TV. most functions for DVDVCR. limited  function for my receiver but sufficient..  It doesnt support any LD  players. but even if it did. I dont expect my old Samsung LD player to be  supported.Its RF capability doesnt seem to work very well while my old  pair of pyramid IRRF remote extenders still functions flawlessly.  Though  not up to my expectations. this Jensen remotes RF  capability is adequate.  dropping it down to 4 stars.Other annoyances. claims to control  ProLogic receivers but cannot on my Dolby DigitalProLogic receiver only  one receiver setting can control most of my Sonys functions except the  power switch. I had to use AUX2 with a different code that can only turn  the receiver on or off. Its not perfect. but its the best I own for the  price range.  Its much more functional than my other programmablelearning  remotes.  I do recommend it.,4,1,1116

A1SXQ7CSLW6KDW,22,Looks pretty nice. like a Moleskine notebook. But it is too thick. so I end to use the kindle naked. The elastic bands are a worse sujection option than the Amazon one.

You dont have to buy the orginalcigarette lighter from. get one that compatable with panasonic. it works.  2. You can perchase the extra battery unit.it holds regular AAA..  Another thing. I had this unit for over a year in the car now. and it works perfectly.  Meanwhile my friend had a Sony MDplayer in his car. and broke within a year.  I can tell you that this little thing might not look as fancy as it is. and maybe a bit too thick. but its great in and out.except writing names..  And plus. it never skips on me. no matter I am listening at home. walking. runing. or driving. My conculsion. this MDplayer worth more than you are paying for.compare to other MDplayers..,5,1,772

A1T2DUOCI6766V,22,We ordered this cable from Charger City instead of the others available on Amazon because we wanted the longest one available.  The discripton claimed 10 ft. long cable.

A1T38NLNDB2PMJ,12,Im very picky when it comes to memory cards for either my camera andor phone. I usually try to get the biggest GB I could get and the best. So far I have been looking for a GB MicroSD card for my phone. After hearing lots of reviews but also problems from the other SanDisk 32GB how it caused some problems for others who had the Galaxy s4 and it erased memorydata. but worked for a lot. I didnt want to take the risk of losing data or picturesmusic on my phone by getting the 32 GB. Maybe the 32GB didnt work for some because they already had data and pics on it already or the GB was too big to handle.After hearing a lot of good reviews from the Professional Ultra SanDisk 16GB also. I prayed that this memory chip work for my phone. Sure it wasnt a 32GB. but it was big enough to hold more pictures and apps on it. And it worked for my phone!I was getting nervous hoping not to get a format popup sign when I inserted the chip. but Thank God it didnt and the memory card gave me no problems whatsoever.  ..,5,1,1010

A1TAFEUKHIFV6L,0,.December 2000.I really like these headphones.  I also tried the Sony RF950RK. which is in a comparable price range.What I liked about Sony.  longer battery life .15 hr instead of 6 hr. theres a stand on which you can hang your headphones theres an auto onoff feature that saves battery life.What I didnt like about Sony.  you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit .I was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge. like the Palm Pilots do in their cradles. when I tilt my head forward .at my desk. since I use these at work.. they slide off.What I like about Advent.  the sound is slightly better the battery recharging is easy .plug it in and it recharges. they are more comfortable than the Sonys.What I didnt like about Advent.  theres no recharging stand the tuning knob is in a really bad place .where youd put your hands when youre putting the headphones on..I didnt really care about the range. because Im really only using them in the same room.  One thing to be aware of. the Advent instruction manual .which nobody reads. says you should plug them into the LINE OUT and not the SPEAKER OUT port.  The line out has a much stronger signal .unless you turn up the volume on the sound source..  Theres also an adjustment knob youre supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level.  Before I did these two things. I got a lot of noise.  After I read the instructions and set up a strong signal. I had almost no noise.Overall I really love them.  I can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate. and theyre comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble..December 2003.I no longer use these headphones for day to day use.  After about six months. I got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out. the increasing amount of hiss. and the random loss of stereo signal.  Im back to using regular wired headphones. this time spending only USD18 on an Aiwa pair that I like.  I still use the Advent wireless headphones for occasional TV viewing .where sound quality is not so important.. but I wouldnt recommend them.,2,0,2116

I have never connected below 46K.  Heres  the great part. it has Jumpers!  Its the only modem I could find w  jumpers.  It works in my new Linux system.  The other cool part is a  connector to use your soundcard w the modem so you dont need cheeesy  speakers for speakerphone u0026amp voice.Highest Rating.

A1TBXF9K4DHO3C,6262,I recently purchased  a set of these little radios for a campinghunting trip and they are great! I used them to communicate with my friends while out in the woods and there are very handy. They have a very good range 1.52 miles depending on the terrain and the signal is very clear with no interferance or static! they have many useful features such as 14 channels with the 38 sub codes a rodger beep tone that can be turned off if you wish and a privacy.voice scramble. mode. We used them while driving to and from the woods and campsite and basically anytime we werent in ear shot of each other. I would highly reccomend these radios to anyone I now have several pairs,5,1,670
A1TCCGVDJV9XAV,22,I consider myself a well educated electronics purchaser who did a lot of homework over getting the kindle fire or the nook tablet.  Being a tech geek. I decided to go with the nook because of its superior specs and the fact that I prefer the nook reading experience better than the kindle one.  After doing my homework and playing with the tablet in the store I felt I made the right decision until I got it home.The nook market absolutley ruins this thing to the point I am looking to root it.  There are next to zero free apps and despite already knowing that the tablet would not honor the apps I already own in the android market for my phone. I never expected in a million years that APPS THAT ARE NORMALLY FREE IN THE ANDROID MARKET ARE OVERPRICED EXTENSIVELY.  For example. Angry birds seasons is free on android market.  Its USD3!!!!!! on the nook app market.  This is rape.And if you are expecting to root this device. it appears barnes and noble is aggressively patching their device to disallow the use of outside apps.If you want to read books only. get the nook color or an eink device.  If you want a tablet. This will only frustrate you.  I feel violated and disappointed I overlooked the pricing on the market.,2,0,1226
A1TCF8MWQMRO4G,612,Its a pity there is no option for either zero or negative stars. I recently bought a 10pack of RCA videotapes. and quite frankly. I wish Id thrown my money in the street instead. These things are absolutely. positively horrid! The tape is wound too loosely on the reels. and there is NO RATCHETING MECHANISM to tighten the tape!

A1TE6IFFPTUB86,0,My first digital camera looks like something out of a Cracker Jack box compared to this one!  The lower of the Mavica line. it does not do video and may have a lower number of pixels. but I feel it is a really great  camera for the price!Being able to store photos directly on disk is the  greatest invention. and the menuindexing screens allow you to view photos  right away to decide if you want to continue or delete an image without  having to wiat until theyre on the computer screen.The battery has a  long life. and recharging is quick and easy.  Bought the package with the  carrying case. which has room for camera. charger. and plenty of  disks.Very happy with this camera overall!,4,1,691
A1TEEBGRM13VJ1,1616,I just purchased the lock recently. The lock is very hard to put on and take off. Even with the right combination on you have to pull a bit hard at the cable.

A1TEKCBCU3ZBXE,22,This camera takes excellent quality digital pictures and comes with the Nikonview software which enables you to make basic edits on the pictures on your computer.  It is fairly easy to use and the compact flash uploads into the computer either via a reader or directly from the camera.

A1TEZBRWLAIU5M,55,Good quality cassette tape being available was something I took for granted until I wanted to transfer 30yr old tapes to new ones.

A1TG5C2B7FEJ1K,0,This item is advertised as a Garmin charger. It is not OEM equipment from Garmin. It fits the Garmin Nuvi 1490t but is not produced by the Garmin company. Priced too high for a Garmin knockoff.,3,0,193
A1TG9V3FVZSTN6,58,A cheap case that looks nice. has a slim profile. and works well.  The iPad slides in from the hinged side of the case so it is impossible for the iPad to slide out when its closed.  None of the sockets are covered or obscured and the leather fits tight for awhile.  The only bad part is that the case has a tendency to loosen up a bit so the iPad can slide when the case is fully opened.  I put a piece of non adhesive rubber between the felt like lining and the back of the iPad which fixed it perfectly.  I have had a number of people compliment me on the case and asked where I got it.  Its much better and cheaper then anything you can find locally.,4,1,654

A1THVYYKIYZAD7,0,I purchased this to add a phone line to the 2nd floor of my house .which does not have a phone jack.  simply adding a traditional phone line. no VOIP. no TIVO. nothing fancy.  We have DSL. so I used the 2Wire filters and tried every phone jack in the house for the base.  Some had a clearer connection than others. but with every attempt. after 5 seconds to 60 seconds. the line would disconnect and the remote phone was left with no connection.  I reset the units. followed all troubleshooting options. and still had the same problem.I returned this unit  I dont know if this was an individual defect. or another symptom of a faulty product. but based on the negative reviews. I wont be ordering another to find out.,1,0,717
A1TIPQPZ4LXFJT,23,First of all the camera is tiny.  It easily fits in ones pocket. and can be transported around without too much bulk.  Think about it. you are spending USD50USD70 on a digital camera. you are getting what you pay for.  People who buy the camera expecting great pictures are fooling themselves.  If you want a great camera drop your USD300 on another camera. and post a  5star review over there.  This camera for the price is what I expected.  THere are some qwirks. but once you muddle through them. youve got a  camera. which costs less than most PCMAC cameras that sit ontop of your  monitor. and you can take some decent pictures.  Here are some hints if you  buy the camera.  1.  Register the product on the AGFA website and  download the latest version of the software .the most recent patch..  Until  I did this. I couldnt download the pictures.  2.  Be wary of the  light in your pictures and do NOT include any light sources. only indirect  light.  3.  ALWAYS USE THE FLASH.  4.  When placing the  pictures in a web page or an email. reduce the size by about half and the  pictures look great!  5.  The u0026quotQuick Fixu0026quot function does a  great job. so use it!  After learning these simple tips. my pictures are  very clean. and look great as an EMAIL picture. or one for the web.  This  is not the kind of camera to replace your film camera. just one to take fun  pictures and send to your friends.  If you expect more. you are fooling  yourself!  Have a good time snapping your cheap digital pictures!,4,1,1520

A1TKTY8A6QZAU6,22,Bought this product two months ago and none of the chargers work anymore.  The wall charger was the first to go after about one month it just stopped working when you plugged it into the phone.  If you hold it at just the right position. it will charge for one moment. and then stop again.  I used this one the most. about once each day at work.  About one month later. the car charger also stopped working. same story as the wall charger.  And. to top it all off. I decided to try and use the USB cable .which I never even used up until that point. as a charger by connecting it to my computer at work. and it did the same thing as the other two on its very first use it would charge for a moment if you held it at just the right spot and then quit again.  All three pieces turned out to be complete garbage in the end.,1,0,820
A1TLCK0EK2976F,11,I wanted to add an additional extension to my RC 930 wireless modem. This was the only RCA extension unit that I could find so I ordered it. I now know that the RCA wireless phone and modem systems are not compatible. RCA confirmed this over the phone and also said that the modem extensions are not sold separately.,1,0,316
A1TLNMQG6MUSR9,2324,PERFECT for what I needed.  I wanted to stream movies when we use our RV but did not want to have to carry my computer every time.  It arrived very quickly so I was able to use it on our next camping trip.,5,1,205
A1TMEVDZGD8DFZ,33,After about six months of use it started using batteries even though it was turned off. A few months later it quit working completely. I sent it in to be repaired under warranty. They sent me a new one along with a power cable. It worked fine for about four months .it only had a 90 day warranty.. before it did the same thing. I turn it on now and the whole screen goes black. It worked very well and I liked the GPS and functioanlity. when it worked. I am now stuck with a nonworking GPS and the accessories that I wont be able to use with the Garmin I plan on buying. Everyone I have talked to told me I should have bought a Garmin as they are the best.,1,0,656
A1TMVIMYYQ4OBI,47,Ive been using a set of these for over a year. and they are a godsend but not perfect. The good news I use it to connect my Tivo .Tivo needs to dial in every night to update its program data. and it was the perfect solution for a tough spot. since theres no phone jack anywhere near my television. I have also used it to surf the web with a dialup connection. with no real problems. Its fine. even through an extension cord! The bad news Ive tried to use for a phone. and that rally didnt cut it. It worked. but its a bad connection. I couldnt tolerate it. So I dispute the earlier comment that it cant be used for data. For me. its only use is for data. not voice! For certain situations. its ideal.,4,1,700
A1TN2BHF8DNJF3,4042,The item doesnt work! What a joke and disappointment. I am returning it. No wonder its discontinued. Shouldve known better ..,1,0,125

A1TN741NG9R91H,11,I purchased this card as one of the original guinea pigs. when the 32 MB card was just released. It was significantly more money. but the prerelease reviews had it as a big improvement for 3D applications .not  games.. What a waste of money. You get more bang for the buck with the Rage  Orion.,2,0,294
A1TNK6MP89YXY2,911,When it comes to notebook physical security you need a device that will deter crimes of opportunity  such as those presented by leaving your notebook at your desk at work or at a table in a library while you browse the shelves.  If you want to protect your notebook from a determined thief. buy a safe.Most cable security devices are going to provide about the same amount of security so you need to focus on ease of use.  If a device is easy to use. then youre more likely to use it and use it properly.  The Kensington system doesnt get much simpler.  It consists of a cable. which is wrapped around a reasonably unmoveable object. and an attached key lock that attaches directly to your notebooks security slot.Compare the Kensington system with the Curtis 06414 system and youll probably agree that the Kensington system is far easier to use.  Compare its 1 piece system to the Curtis system which uses a cable. a seperate metal piece that hooks to the notebooks security slot and a seperate lock that connects that piece to the cable.  Thats 3 seperate pieces. a little more effort to hook everything up and the possibility of losing that tiny metal piece the whole system depends on.Ive used both the Kensington and the Curtis systems at work and have found the Kensington system to be far easier to use.  I put one key on my keyring. put the other key someplace safe and can toss the cable into my bag and be good to go.  With the Curtis system. I had to make use of its storage bag just so I wouldnt lose the individual pieces.  Im also sure the extra effort required to setup the Curtis system will prevent some people from using the device as much as they should.The Kensington system costs a little more money. but it is definitely worth it.  Its my choice for my personal notebook.,5,1,1793
A1TNK82XJQ0XPK,1291,Im a computer consultant. which means I use my PalmPilot all the time.  I had a Palm III. but it died from the abuse of travelling in my back pocket.  I switched to the Palm V series for its solid construction and rechargable battery.  I searched for a case that would protect the device from daily wear and tear and chose the Palm V hard case for this reason.  It protects the screen with its clamshell closure and does not add bulk to the package.  Even with the case. its still smaller than a Palm III.  You have to keep your cradle near the edge of your desk if you want to HotSync while still inside the case.  I had to add small adhesive pads to protect the metallic finish.  Other than that. its perfect!  When I beat up the case too much. Ill just buy another one.  My Palm V still looks brand new!,4,1,806

A1TPB3S2DMC0XJ,11,I feel that the portable DVD player is a convenient item to have around.  Whether youre traveling. or out having fun. it is always handy.  Though it is convenient. there are still downsides to this product.  One of them is  that you cannot watch television broadcasts.  This feature would make it a  very worthwhile product to purchase.  Another downside is that it is a  u0026quotlittle bitu0026quot overpriced.  Until this product receives competition  with other companies such as Sony or Philips. you wont be seeing this  product in many households across the US and other countries.  Portable  computers already have an optional DVD feature.  With this feature added to  the software and hardware already on the computer makes the computer more  valuable. and it costs little more than the portable DVD player alone.  Overall. this product was a good idea. but. as stated before. it costs more  than many people are willing to pay.,3,0,936
A1TPPJIWRE8LG6,11,I followed the instructions exactly and have used a similar product before with success. However. this caused my VCRDVD combo player to power down. Try another brand or read your VCR manual first to confirm how to clean it. In addition. Amazon will not allow a return because of the liquid cleaner which is flammable. Would have been helpful if Amazon had said so in the description. Why is Amazon still selling this defective product?,1,0,435
A1TRMLDUKEMT9V,0,Had trouble with Post Office Tracking Service. Kept telling me they didnt have it. Well it finally arrived but was 4 days later than expected. Glad to get it not shippers fault.

A1TTVHL8XE4MJ3,0,I bought this camera a year ago. have made approx. 30 rolls. and I am very happy with it.  It is durable .once I dropped it from a height of 1 meter onto a concrete floor. no problems.. compact. light. makes excellent  pictures. and is easy to use. A few things that I dont like about it are  the fact that after turning the camera off my flash settings are reset. the  buttons are tiny .although usable.. and developing APS film is expensive  .not a fault of this camera of course..,5,1,483

A1TWWI5944VLDY,12,I did my research and felt like the Nook would be a good choice for an ereader. This thing is horrible!! Kept telling me I was connected but then kept saying the network could not connect! Downloading is a joke! Does not download. even trying to download from Barnes u0026 Nobles site is a task. Instructions that come with this is laughable just tells you a basic jist but does not address any problems.I have just spent over an hour and a half trying to download purchases and its still not transferring! This is so very frustrating. What a piece of junk. I will be going back to Bu0026N first thing tomorrow to get a refund. Customer service is a joke. not open late enough. Do your research. and look for other complaints about this one chances are. the negative things people say about the Nook are correct.,1,0,812
A1TX2BLQ6DK9KM,317,Great for watching Netflix movies. quick basic search of the web. checking email and of course reading. .Please remember this is not a computer so it does not act like one.. It occasionally stalls but not often enough to bother me. I did also purchase the N2A .R.  32GB Nook to Android 4.1 bootable microSD Card.No problems to date and it has been heavily used. I am pleased with my purchase.,5,1,392
A1TX3VNWII1TOJ,44,Okay. since most of the printers dont come with cables any longer. you always need to purchase one separately.  A u0026quotregularu0026quot printer cable can cost around USD20 and it can be difficult to plug and unplug correctly without breaking one or more of those tiny prongs.  So a USB cable is a great solution.  It costs less and its easy to plug and unplug. especially if your computer has frontmounted USB ports.  I bought this one for my new HP LaserJet 1012 Printer and it works just fine.  For this price. its a great bargain.,5,1,537
A1TXNLH7V6S4LH,1717,I bought 2 sets of these speakers after looking into several other brands and found these to be the best price value.  Im semipleased witht their performance.  I bought them to replace my computer speakers because I have a laoptop and an ipod where I store ALL of my music.  I like the fact that if I want music in many rooms of my house. I dont have to move the whole laptop as well as a small set of speakers.  I leave my laptop hooked to the transmitter in the living room and have music in any room I want. including outside.The downside. I spend almost as much time trying to get a good signal as I do listening to my favorite songs....the signal always seems to go out when my favorites are on and I find that I have to unplug the AC adapter from the transmitter and plug it back in sometimes to get the signal to come back....,3,0,833
A1TXTPBM4Y94U0,99,This product is garbage. Had issues from the start. then at the end it came apart. Feels and looks cheap. Even though it came in a Samsung package it makes me want to think that is a cheap Chinese copy .no offense to anyone.,1,0,224

A1TYTLET80FO1T,0,I have had this DVD player for more than a year.  It has never ever froze or shut itself off on me.  It comes with lots of features and I dont notice anything at all wrong with the picture quality.  I noted that one review said it was sluggish when going through menus. Hadnt noticed that either. It may have something to with the way that person set up his entertainment system.  I dont know.  We have a digital cable box and our stereo with speakers all hooked up to our television and havent noticed anything wrong.  I think this is a good way to go if you want a quality DVD player.,5,1,586
A1TZ020K7JKFDV,12,Yes. you get what you pay for. but Ive had cheap headphones last many years. so I expect more than a couple months use.  Not made to last.,2,0,138
A1TZ59UDCG6JFV,0,Just what I needed.  I mounted this high. and it swings out and pivots into the open doorway for a more natural viewing  angle from my exercise machine.  My one complaint is that it is pretty hard to change the tilt since I may be on the floor or raised up on the elliptical trainer.  I completely understand the complexity here  the weight of the TV means you need something solid and tight or it would always droop .no drooping here. but I think they could have come up with an alternative to give the control without breaking out a wrench.,4,1,542
A1TZJ574JUHH6S,0,The microphone and earbud itself are not bad. but. I was expecting to get a set of 2.  The picture shows 2 sets. yet only 1 shipped.  I think the seller is misleading by showing 2 headsets in the pic. but only shipping 1.  I did read over the description and it never said there were 2.  Nonetheless. if I would have gotten 2 as the picture shows. it would be a good deal and a 5 star rating.  2 stars given for only getting 1 set. and it being overpriced for the quality of just the 1.,2,0,486
A1U09KI1OMH06R,0,I bought this camera based on the recommendation from the Time magazine article in December. All I wanted to do is send pictures of my kids to Grandma and Grandpa through email. I loved the ease of use and quality of  the camera. I wanted a camera that was compact.similar to the Canon elph.  and was pleased to see it was very close in size. Based on what I spent I  couldnt see being too critical in any way. With the built in flash.  supplied software and batteries I was sending pictures within minutes.  Unless you are a pro. I suggest you give this one a try.,5,1,565
A1U1Q4SO0C4B0T,2126,I bought this recently . I have the nook color tablet and love it. but it`s not the easiest to read in the sun.... the Simple touch is amazing in the sun !!!!,5,0,158
A1U25CO184VS8I,23,Ok. the Nook Tablet is obviously a superior tablet. Fast. amazing screen and downright sexy. However. Amazon has a FAR better web presence and overall superior services. Has anyone here been on the Bu0026N site? It is so far behind Amazon. Just wish there were a happy medium here other than side loading.,5,1,305
A1U27KEQJLR310,45,I started out with a Palm III. switched to a handheld PC and am now back with the Palm V.  For the everyday person its more than enough.  I didnt buy it to play games with  I bought it to stay organized.  The extreme  ease of use is wonderful and syncing to your PC is a breeze.  Anybody that  needs more than this needs a handheld PC .Which have their own combersome  problems!.  I have found the OS platform with the Palm V much easier to  sync with my desktop  especially with WindowsNT.  Too many problems  connecting with WindowsCE.  The Palm V has far exceeded my needs and is  perfect for the everyday user looking for a palm organizer that is just  that. an organizer and 24hr assistant.,5,1,695
A1U37BF5OT4GOR,2933,They were cheap when I got them.Good sound quality.But not adjustable laterally. so if youve got the wrong sized head. it could be a problem.I think I have a normalsized head and they pressed too much on my ears.Very comfortable at first. but then my ears ended up hurting after a couple of hours.Also. the thin layer of leathery material of the earpieces wore out sooner than I would expect. flaking away to expose the foam underneath.,3,0,436
A1U39Y9O5IEXX2,11,Bought this to replace a strip style one.  the shape makes it easy to fit adapters.  One downside. the power button is small and recessed.  Which is fine to avoid accidental power off. but if you use it to turn everything off at once. is kind of a pain.,4,1,253
A1U3M4R71OZOR4,0,I bought my Minolta Explorer Freedom Zoom a month ago and I am totally satisfied with my purchase. For the price. you cant beat it.  What you are getting is next generation technology. yet a user friendly point and shoot  camera that takes very clear. very crisp pictures that rival the more  expensive SLRs.  I cant believe what this camera can do and for it to be  so small and compact!  Also. I am really into the way it feels in your  hands. its well balanced and just a sharp little camera. I never thought I  could get excited about a simple point and shoot. but I am.  Go ahead and  shop around. but you wont find a better camera for the money.,5,1,651
A1U3OF3P0VF7WB,1313,This camera was excellent for the price  on sale for USD...  I used it semi regularly. never dropped it. never exposed it to the elements .heat. liquids. etc...  It ate batteries like mad. but I was satisfied overall....except that it just up and died.  New batteries didnt work the display just flashed the empty battery sign.  I put a message on Agfas website to get tech help.  Never got any response except for the automated email they send when you enter a message.  Overall  descent camera that had a fatal flaw that Agfa apparently doesnt give a s**t about.  Figured it would cost more to send to Agfa to fix it. so I chunked the f**ker in the trash.  Thanks a billion. Agfa.  Ill be sure to avoid your products in the future.,1,0,733
A1U4J2HT3P8GZM,33,Overall. I think the Nook tablet is a pretty good tablet.  It has a great price. the screen is good and the colors look great on it. but there are two major issues that I have with this tablet that keep it from being truly great.My first issue that I have with it is that the OSNook Software that it comes with is extremely limited.  I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and I was sorely disappointed to see that a lot of the appsgames that she wanted either were not available at all or had a price attached to them through the Bu0026N store.  These are the same games you can get for free through the Google Play store.  I was pretty mystified to say the least.My next issue. and perhaps the biggest issue I have. is their charger.  Its a proprietary charger .not your standard USB universal charger. and it SUCKS.  Its the worst thing Ive ever seen.  Its cheapflimsy and Ive had to replace it numerous times because the prong is extremely weakfragile.  Theres not even a good aftermarket charger that you can buy to rectify the situation.  All of the chargers that Ive seen .whether it be through Bu0026N or aftermarket. are crap and its only a matter of time before youll have to replace them.  At USD10 a pop .through Bu0026N.. this can add up.I was able to solve the first problem by rooting the tablet to run Android and get the Google Play store. but sadly theres no fix to the 2nd problem and that problem can bleed your wallet over time.I really want to like this tablet because I feel like its a great budget tablet. but when you look at the hidden costs .rooting + chargers. Id almost be inclined to pay a little extra for something like a Kindle.In sum. its not bad once you overcome the OS problem. but the charger will keep it from being great.  Perhaps the newer models addressed that. but on this model Id advise to seek other options.,3,0,1860

A1U8Q222E0VSUT,0,This is not really what they have advertised.Its the standard generic microusb end. not the MHL end that is Flyer Specific.This stuff DOES work with the Flyer......But this type of connection is prone to falling out if I am using the Flyer while I am charging it.....Thats why I wanted something Flye Specific............ the MHL stays anchored firmly in place even when I am whipping the tablet around playing need for speed...Its a decent price for all the stuff in the package.......I am keeping it because it would be too much of a pain to return..... Buit I would never have ordered it if I knew it was NOT gear made specifically for the Flyer as the description states.,3,0,675
A1U8W9I5RBTKQV,0,I wish I could give this so many more stars than 5.  I totally love this thing. I started with a Kindle 3. didnt like it at all. returned it and got the Nook. I love it so much. I actually have trouble putting it down. The touchscreen rocks and makes its so easy to navigate. I have an iphone so Im touchscreen spoiled lol. I think this was my main issue with the Kindle. I hated the Kindles buttons and struggled navigating on it then along came the Nook and its color touchscreen saved me.  Dont think twice. grab yourself a Nook and melt away in hours of pleasurable reading.Also I saw lots of complaints that the Nook unit was slow. maybe cuz I have the 1.4 update installed? It seems fine to me. so I believe all the negative reactions are to the original unit prior to updates.Edit. I left a 1 star review of the Kindle and got attacked by people calling me names and liar cuz I said I liked the Nook better. I deleted the review to avoid further harrashment.,5,1,965

A1UA80MIL9OUVQ,1012,I ordered these tape cassettes for my husband.

A1UA8Z5PQ7MMNP,11,Bought my wife and I each a Garmin GPS for Christmas and purchased two of these so that we would both have a charger for work or home.

Im contacting the seller to attempt to return both chargers. I would not recommend this product at all.,1,0,378
A1UADKP60C7GXG,1313,As this was my first camcorder. I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera. The picture quality is amazing. Have taken a lot of video from a moving semitruck and the steady cam worked great. I also purchased the  AV cordless receiver so all you do is point the camera at the TV and  playback. works nicely. I have the Sony 35u0026quot Triniton TV connected to  my audio system and playback is wonderful. Coupled with the Snappy. a video  digitizer. its easy to capture snapshots from the video and email or post  pictures on the web. Very pleased with this camera and would buy it again.,4,1,598

A1UC5JFTLYSAIG,0,As a librarian. I can not and do not recommend this product to my patrons.  The product itself is faulty. and the customer service and return policies are very poor.My mother loved her Nook Color so much. she offered to buy me either the Color or the Touch.  I went with the Touch. thought something simpler would be nice. since I work around computers all day.  I was wrong.  Within the first 20 days. my Nook started to devour battery power.  I was told when I bought it I had 30 days to return it for a new one. but apparently. they changed that.  I was offered a refurbished product to replace a brand new one. which I thought was really cheap of them. and not good customer service.  Then. I was told it was a software issue. and would be resolved soon. so I held on to my Nook.  One software update and two other fixes later. and it STILL drains the battery by the minute. lasting only about 8 hours. instead of the promised 2 months.  I was told to call the warrenty dept. but that was a wasted call  they only repeated what had already been said. and also pointed out Id now had the unit for 90 days.  Well. yes I did. but it didnt work MOST of that time. and I only kept it because they kept saying it would be fixed!  And yes. the wifi was OFF. its rarely on. actually.,1,0,1279
A1UCRLJK5QVI0P,610,Going on the positive reviews this headset had. I bought it.  But it just didnt fit right on my average size and shape ears.  It isnt adjustable  and fell off many times.

A1UHTZPOWJ6GG8,12,I just got these for Radioshack for USD99 .they were on clearence..  I do agree they are not the easiet things to set up with the fidling of dials.  Some attempts to tune them seem to work with only limited success as they would give out a clicking sound.  However once I found a good channel I liked them a lot.  I use them to play mp3s that are being streemed from my Linksys Media Adapter.I live in San Francisco in a middle floor condo and have yet to have issues with interference from my cordless phone or extneral. The guy in Radioshack did say there were some areas on the city where they did not work well.In conclusion they met my requirement of playing music in both ends of my condo without running wires.,3,0,717

A1UIUV0YRYPAAV,22,I would to have give this one star out of the box I could not get anything the weather channel came in great all the other channels not so much also would say get a outdoor Antenna that help a lot now I can hear some people on radio also the Cigarette Adapter is great the only problem I have is when I hit the gas on my truck I can hear my engine threw the CB speaker which lowers the  quality of the sound I have to shut my truck off so I can not hear my engine threw the CB speaker. I would not buy this CB at all not worth the money and pain the only good channel I found again was the weather channel...Very unhappy with this CB,1,0,633
A1UK9O1SFVME71,23,I had these speakers replaced because of the irritating buzzing sound emenating from the woofer. The replacement set still u0026quotbuzzesu0026quot continuously. I have to turn them off when theyre not in use so the sound doesnt drive me crazy. Ill just cut my losses and get something else. Dont buy these speakers!,2,0,316
A1UL2J2RVDBSB7,34,Item was advertised as new. It was shipped in a box that was not sealed shut. The item itself was opened.The item itself was not the high quality I had expected.

A1ULDLSQBGRS79,14,This product was advertised as skip proof and waterresistent and its  niether! You cant go jogging without it skipping every 10 seconds.....and  the ESP2 doesnt work at all! It skips just as much when the ESP2 is on! I  dont recomend this CD player.....you should definetly look for a better  product!,2,0,301

A1UODITLV1DFOD,11,Ive never owned any products by KLH but after reading the reviews here i felt confident that they would be decent.  I have a new high end sony receiver and all monster cable.  So thats not the problem.  I set these up as rear speakers. They didnt stay up long.  They emit a constant hum as soon as theyre turned on.  Sound quality was poor with no definition.  They were so bad. i had to send them back since they detracted from my other speakers.  Dont be fooled and think you can get good. quality speakers at this price.  The product is actually even cheaper.,1,0,562

A1UPIG9BI792V6,22,I bought this CD player 9 years ago.  I also havent used it in 4 years. so when I pulled it out of my moving boxes today it was still working without a skip.  I love this player.  It has done a great job.  I dont see the need to buy a new one.  This one rocks!  Too bad its not made anymore.,5,1,291
A1UPMFKSP0SJW9,22,Great TV.  Bought from Amazon.com and delivered inside my house.  Great picture. sound is above average. on screen programming is good and great viewing.  The only drawbacks are that it can only store 32 names for the  stations .nowhere on Toshiba website. in manual.. the remote is a little  awkward. and your picture preferences for the different video sources are  not saved.  These area all minor as the television is one of the best I  have seen.  You might want to buy the stand that matches it. it looks  great.  Just my thoughts.  I really enjoy it.,5,1,557
A1URR8XCQXP8TB,1315,I love the feel of this cover. It is like a supple leather and silicone mixed together.It feels  similar to the back of the nook and provides good grip. I was a little worried that it would impair my ability to hold the device with one hand and push the side page turn button but it does not. I actually prefer the feel of the nook better in this case. more substantial but not heavy. The best part is that its half price what it is at Bu0026N.,5,1,444
A1URUWEXY5VM1P,22,The AMBICO VHSC to VHS Adapter worked for approximately 10 cassettes.  Then the door switch stopped working and became free wheeling.  It is no longer working as I cannot open or shut the door where you load the cassettes.  With shipping. the cost was USD62.98.  I expect better quality for the price.  I will be contacting the company to see if they will replace the Adapter.  Will write another review based on customer service later.July 5  I have to commend the customer service for this product.  I no sooner requested that the defective product discussed above be replaced than I received an email that a new cassette was being sent to me.  It arrived today.  I hope the issue with the door switch will not be a problem with this cassette.  The first one performed beautifully until I had that problem.  It is nice to know that the company and Amazon stand by their merchandise.  Thank you.,3,0,896
A1US87X5YUEQ7A,22,I have been using this scanner for about 3 weeks now. I own 4 other different models of scanners  2 from Radio Shack .PRO92  PRO2067.  and 2 from Uniden .BC 245XLT and BC 235XLT..I like the BC 895XLT because. Fast scanning of 100 channels  second. The Radio Shack .GRE made. scanners that I own only go 25 channelssecond. And while they are more technically sophisticated. I miss the scan speed which is desirable if you live in a busy area. CTCSS tone capability  What this does is let you enter in a  special u0026quotcodeu0026quot that filters out different companies using a frequency. In busy urban areas it is not unusual to have three or four businesses on the same frequency. They use a special code called a u0026quotPLu0026quot code which allows their radios to only hear their broadcasts. The 895xlt supports the use of the PL tone through the CTCSS tone capability built in.You might want to rethink your purchase if. You want to follow BOTH trunked and conventional frequencies at the same time. This scanner only follows one or the other  and if you are following trunked frequencies youll only be able to monitor one bank of them at a time. This scanner does not monitor a common type of trunked frequency called EDACS.Overall.I strongly recommend this scanner. Even though it has a few limitations. you cannot beat the priceperformance. In reality I have found that I monitor very few trunked frequencies  and that the bulk of my local action is the local PD and FD. Even if one town is trunked there is usually more than enough action to be heard on surrounding towns.My one exception to the above advice is if I lived in NY or another big city that had LOTS of trunking. Id probably wait for the 780xlt model.,5,1,1727
A1US87X5YUEQ7A,4748,I just received this camera about a week ago. Since then Ivereplaced the 8mb memory card with a 96mb card. This camera definitelytakes some getting used to. Im taking mostly photos of my new twinsand find that Im either afflicted with the palsy or the camera is super sensitive to shaking. Suggest trying a tripod .that is my next investment..I think you also need to experiment with things like shutter speed to get the maximum picture out of the camera. I have had very mixed results with closeups but blame myself for not having gotten the hang of this yet.Overall it is a really nice unit. solidly built. Youll need a bigger memory card. probably a USB card reader and NIMH batterys .dont let them sell you NICADS  get the 1500mah NIMH along with a 1 hour rapid charger..You wont be sorry with the camera!,5,1,809
A1US87X5YUEQ7A,3435,The only reason NOT to purchase this scanner is if you want to have a police scanner that allows alphabetic tags. Some of the newer radios let you program in not only the frequency but a description .alphabetic tag. so that when the radio stops scanning on a frequency you can see the name of the service you are monitoring.This radio scans fast .100 channelssecond. and is very solid in terms of reception. You can purchase a cable and software to program the scanner from your computer .and therefore avoid having to punch in each frequency on the tiny keyboard..You CAN monitor BOTH conventional and TRUNKED frequencies at the same time! This is a big plus with this scanner as some others .including the 895. claim to trunk but only allow you to monitor either conventional frequencies OR trunked  but not both.Some competitors to this radio.Radio Shack Pro94. Essentially the same radio in a different case.Radio Shack Pro92. Has 500 channels. slower scan speed .25 channelsecond.. the ability to simultaneously scan both conventional and trunk frequencies. Allows programming via computer. Allows storage of alphabetic descriptions of what has been programmed into each channel.Uniden BC 780XLT. Not released as of 112000 .scheduled for 122000 or 12001.. Supposed to be a 500 channel scanner with alpha tags and 100 channelsecond scan speed. Will have all capabilities of the 245. May produce a new handheld based on its design.,5,1,1434
A1USN2GJ1LDS5,1371,Overall. I have been very happy with my belt clip case. I carry my Palm everywhere with me. and the belt clip case has made that easy and safe to do. My only gripe is that I wish I could access my Palm without having to remove it from the case completely. I would really appreciate a case that  would lock securely onto a belt but also allow for complete detachment and  then use of the Palm without removal from the case. However. until someone  designs such a case. I would highly recommend this one.,4,1,502
A1UUDAPP6QU0Q5,1010,This radio has the best sound around. The distant reception is excellent on AM. especially at night. I am not a big FM fan but the reception is acceptable. Only negative is the lack of a lighted dial and the calibration on the dial is not perfect. However. most DXers know by u0026quotsound feelu0026quot where they are in the dark. For the money this is a wonderful value. Lots of bang for the buck. Even with shipping. its a great value.,5,1,439
A1UV3PNF5TXAG6,22,If youre looking for a product to do anything margianally serious with. this is not for you.  The highest capture size that is not distorted is 320  x 240...  Its just not worth the time or money at this resolution...,1,0,217
A1UV6C6ZBTTSW,56,Let me say that its possible that I received a defective cleaner. but this one actually set me back.  When put into the VCR. it would not complete the 20 second cleaning cycle.  It played for maybe 5 seconds. making a terrible grinding noise. before stopping.  I tried it on two VCRs because I wanted to make sure it wasnt my device. and also Im a glutton for punishment.  The cleaner did the same thing with the second .and newer. VCR.  Unfortunately it messed up the head on the first VCR. so Im waiting for another cleaner .NOT a replacement of this one!. to realign it.  Thankfully amazon has a quick and easy return policy.Like I said. it is very possible this was a fluke since I bought it based on the positive reviews...but do be aware.,1,0,744
A1UVK3XZU2ZEGG,910,Ive had these speakers for over a year and a half now and they do a solid job for the price.  search around and find the best price.  Dont expect spectacular results at the high and low ends of the volume spectrum.  The  speakers will tend to distort at high levels of bass.  If you are a serious  gamer or a music listener who loves to pump it up. go for something else.  If you are the average JOe looking for very good sound at a decent price.  you cannot find anything better.  This system comes with 4 satellites so be  sure to buy a sound card that can handle this.  Soundblaster 128 and Live  handle can handle this.,3,0,623
A1UW5W0SZNIEPS,0,I have had the FD 73 for three years now.  When it was brand new. my wife got hit by a wave at the tip of Cabo San Lucas with the camera around her neck.  The camera was in a case but the wave was so strong. water and sand actually got in the camera.  We dried it out and it didnt affect camera function at all.  That was a huge relief because three years ago this camera sold for USD500.  I use it at work a lot to take pictures at office functions.  Everyone is amazed I can pop the disc in any computer and email or print the pictures instantly.  I have used it on vacations outside the US in Internet Cafes to email pictures home.  Its best features are its so easy to use and you can view the pictures on any computer anywhere in the world simply by inserting the floppy disc.  The only problem I have had with the camera is getting consistent picture quality in very light or very dark settings.  That may be operator error but after three years it still happens.  I have looked at upgrading to a MVC with more megapixels but I have learned for each feature you add you lose some of the simplicity of the FD73.,4,1,1116
A1UW6UB820RU7A,66,Great size. great interface.  If you are a power user on the web it can be slow with sites with heavy graphic content. but for reading and the most common web uses its great.

A1UWY9OB9080JS,0,The low rating is because the product description was not thorough enough for this old man.I blame Brother u0026 myself .hindsight. I should have investigated the product more. The descriptionsaid  Brother M231 12Inch Black on White Tape for PTouch Labeler    I have a  PTouch  labeler u0026mistakenly thought the cartridges were for my PTouch. not knowing there must be other models of PTouch.I am a retired manufacturer u0026 my old school thinking was to change model designation  when models were notcompatible.,2,0,515
A1UXAE2SGRAFX,0,This was the third cassette adapter I bought this week in an attempt to listen to my mp3 player through my cars stereo system.  I first tried one by the brand Monster. which only worked properly out of the right channel .left channel was too soft and lacked full bass and treble.. and then an offbrand model from Kmart. which just had downright terrible audio quality.  The Maxwell one seems to be the bigger winner.  Ive only been using it for a day. but so far it works and sounds great.  Not quite CD quality of course. but about as good as one could expect for a cassette adapter.  My one gripe is that the cord from the tape to your mp3 player is very thin and seems kind of cheap.  Im a bit worried about breaking it.  But. given that this is a relatively cheap product that seems very good otherwise Im still giving it 5 stars.  I definitely recommend this product.Just a side notetip. I found that if you turn the volume up on your mp3 player all the way it sounds better than if you have the mp3 player at a lower volume and turn up your car stereo to compensate.,5,1,1072
A1UXHIWQY1I6NP,45,I really like my new product. I have had some issues figuring out how to work the web. I am used to Apple products. I have not tried competitors such as kindle but I am satisfied with the Nook Color. I am interested on how it plays netflix movies.,4,1,247
A1UY4BT1LH53G9,0,Even though Maxells website lists retail outlets that have the item in stock. none of them in my area carry this product.

A1UYA4M18HYQE8,34,This set works ok for listening to speech. But when listening to music. it does make an  irritating noise for certain frequencies making it completely unusable for that purpose .in fact. it will take some time for you to get  rid of the  irritation in your ears even after removing this set.. I  strongly recommend against the purchase of this product. I feel like I made  a mistake by  purchasing this.,1,0,403
A1UYG5AWYJDKQU,88,Both my mother and myself bought one of these for use at auctions. and dont know what we would do without them!  Sure. the resolution is not as high as others. but for what it meant to do the Mavica is untouchable.  Wonderful to use at school with my students. as well!,5,1,269

A1V0VUNM61I0PT,4,I like it. but I do have one problem. they need to get more apps in their store. They do not have any good apps. and if they do. they cost 3 dollars. Angry birds. Wheres my water. and all those good apps are 3 dollars. They do not have most good apps even that you could buy. They barely have any free apps. All the ones that are free are garbage. Complete garbage. But besides apps. it works pretty good. Its pretty fast. and you can go on pretty much any website. I love that you can get Adobe Flash on here. unlike my other tablet. The thing I do mostly on my Nook is watch videos on Youtube. Theres no problem I have to say with the internet. Anyway. overall. I like it.,4,1,674
A1V1KGN2CP02H1,11,In 1992. I bought a Sony CCD FX510 8mm stereo camcorder. By February 2000. we had worn the old camera out. after working around the world! If you want to keep playing 8mm tapes. you either have to replace your 8mm camcorder. or buy a 8mm deck. The camcorders are cheaper than a deck! I  bought the Sony CCDTRV66 because it could play my stereo 8mm tapes from my  old camera. A digital Sony camcorder would do this. but at more USD. The  best surprise was that playback on the new HI8 camcorder seemed to deliver  higher resolution on the old Video 8 tapes. This might be due to the  filtering on the Hi8 camcorder. The TRV66 has image stabilization.  nightshot. Hi8 resolution. stereo sound. lots of digital features and a  color flip out screen. All of this is still less than I paid in 1992  for the CCD FX510. After 8 years. Sony  kept continuity on operational  features the basic functions of their camcorders is the same. Kudos for  great design. I plan to wear out this camera. too!,4,1,989
A1V23NTV7R48CD,33,Almost impossible to put anything on Nook devices UNLESS it is purchased from Barns u0026 Nobles. Using Adobe Digital editions is not supported. If you use the Nook HD tablet. it will be VERY DIFFICULT. if not impossible to load books purchased somewhere else. Also. Android no longer supports Adobe Flash player. but archived versions can be downloaded and installed on Android devices  HOWEVER. you cant install it on the Nook. If you try to install the Adobe Flash Player on the Nook HD Tablet. you will get a message stating that for security reasons you cant install the Adobe Flash Player. My personal opinion is that Barns u0026 Noble doesnt want anything on the Nook UNLESS it is purchased at Barns u0026 Nobles. We have had several ereadertabletsdevices. and the Nook Tablet is the most frustrating device I have ever used. I will never purchase Barns u0026 Noble devices again. The closed architecture is the exact reason I have never purchased Apple computers and devices. I just wish I had known that Barns u0026 Nobles devices are closed architecture as well.,1,0,1072

A1VBYWWCQAXU0N,55,Having existing wired outdoor speakers on my patio that were of poor quality. I went looking to replace them. The speaker was recommended to me as an alternative to having to rewire and install my patio with new speakers.  Setup was extremely easy and the sound quality is very good.  It would be nice to have a remote to control the volume instead of having to get up and turn the speakers on. but no one offers this feature that I am aware of.  I am ordering the cordless headphones also so I can listen to music while my kids watch TV in the same room.,5,1,555

A1VF7NCOK71DSP,11,I owned the first Rio PMP 300 and it was novel. It was enough to get me interested in a website called Audible.com .now a direct link from Amazon.com under the talking books section.. To make a long story short. when the Rio 500 came out earlier in the year I simply had to own one. It holds up to 26 hours of audio for audio books. That means you can get up to 4 whole books in the unit at once! Unabridged books. if they are short. If you are a u0026quotbooks on tapeu0026quot person. you should look at the Rios Audible Manager software that comes with it and you should check out Audible.coms 14.000 titles .again. a direct link from Amazon.coms talking books.. When I commute. I dont have to fumble with tapes and I can listen to my books. I can also have them on airplanes and in hotel rooms. About the size of a single cassette. this little jewel is sized for portability and travel needs. Dont overlook this potential benefit when shopping for MP3 players.,5,1,964

A1VHRWSJ4NV9L3,0,Dad came to visit during Thanksgiving Holidays. He casually mentioned how he misses listening to some of his old cassette tapes while on long drives in the car. He went on to describe a story where he asked the young lady behind the counter if they had any in stock. The young employee was confused. She had never heard of such an item. While he was describing the item. I simultaneously grabbed my laptop. searched amazon and ordered it. He was super tickled to receive it in the mail. My dad does not  do  the internet or any type of online shopping. So this just made his day! Thanks!,4,1,587

A1VIOMFVTNCVOD,0,What with all of the hype lately about how DVD will supplant the VCR. I hesitated to spend a ton of money when my VCR died.  So far. I think this one is terrific.

A1VITU4NOWDEN2,12,Now. you can nitpick or you can just accept the fact that for USD89.99 you cant expect much from a pointandshoot camera. Well. the Olympic Stylus Epic just may surprise you here. This little gem delivers the goods. and  with surprising results. Crisp. clear photos that fall only slightly short  of a good SLR makes this camera a real contender. Its a lightweight  breaking out of its class to rival more expensive cameras. The flash  options are top drawer. with amazing results. I shot a perfect 25 out of 25  on my first roll. Not one photo was out of focus. underoverexposed. or  failed to flash. Its a smart flash that makes you look good. Its fast lens  reduces the need for higher speed films. and increases the effectiveness of  the flash. I found that the fill flash mode works extremely well in shaded  areas without washing out your subject.I highly recommend this little  powerhouse. Dont be fooled by those cheap zooms. This camera works so well  because it lacks a zoom. Zoom lenses are a compromise which sacrifice crip.  clear photos for convenience. Just step a little closer to your  subject...the excercise will do you good.,5,1,1143
A1VIYN7YXJ2P3U,33,Okay. I bought this case with my Palm V in fall of 1999. Loved it then. love it now. The pockets hold all kinds of stuff. and with the simple tabloop closure it is quite expandable. The case has worn very well. acheiving a kind of supple patina with constant carrying and shoving it in and out of coat pockets. Stylish and slim. just like the descriptor says.However. I tend to drop my Palm V all the time. Well. at least once a week anyway. and for a year. that was okay. The case protected it and all was good. Then one day I dropped it on a tile department store floor. and the popping sound it made on contact was decidedly different. Sure enough. I had spiderwebbed the screen with fissures and all was lost.Then I replaced the unit and kept the case. only to have it happen again .this time on hardwood floors in my home.. Okay. Im a klutz. what can I tell you? But again the case was not protection enough. In the first bad incident. my Palm landed on a corner and in the second it landed on its face .IN the case.. this time the damage was not as severe. but the screen was basically shot.Again I repairedreplaced the unit and now. hundreds of dollars in damage after my purchase of the Palm V. I live in constant fear of tile and wood floors and parking lots everywhere. I am searching for a new. more durable case. but one with the same look and feel .no zippers!. just isnt out there. So buy this case. but be warned. Youll need to be careful.,3,0,1454
A1VJGPW4W8FBFV,911,These inexpensive earphones provide adequate rendering of sound from TV. movies. etc.  However. in terms of comfort. they leave much to be desired.  The flat. hard plastic speaker enclosure is only covered by a thin. somewhat scratchy  cloth  material.  It provides inadequate cushioning of ones ears from the hard plastic of the speaker enclosures.  A cotton. or even a foam covering would be an improvement.,2,0,409
A1VJQ2J4LSUGKK,34,I bought the nook color several months ago.  Like many people. I shopped around for the best ereader for me.  I settled on the nook color for these reasons.* Children Books where my kids remained engaged with the colorful pictures.  The Read to Me feature on some books is awesome for my young nieces.  And they like to swipe between the pages.* Being able to read books checked out from the library.  This was the biggest feature for me.  If you currently check out electronic books from your library and use Adobe Digital all you need to do is plug your nook into your computer wait for the little icon to appear in Adobe Digital then drag and drop the book to your nook.  Poof! your book is now on your nook.* Ability to read multiple formats of ebooks.  All of them except Kindle ..  Maybe that will come available one day.* Access to the internet.  I love being able to access news sites and readanswer my email.* Has expandable memory.  The Nook comes with 5Gigs of internal memory.  But you can expand that memory with a SD mini card.  I am told you can expand up to 32 Gigs. but I only have a 2 Gig card and it seems plenty for now.* I can store my photos and music on the nook and play them whenever Im reading or want to show off my photos to friends and family.* Size of the nook is perfect to carry around and it feels solid.  It doesnt feel like it will fall apart in your hands.Now with all of these features. it was enough to purchase the nook and I wasnt disappointed.  The touch screen is extremely responsive.  Reading outside. I thought would be an issue. but it is not.  I just adjust the screen brightness and the sunlight isnt an issue any more.  The only issue I found is the speaker isnt very loud. but it does have a headphone jack so then sound doesnt become an issue.  The battery life. will not be able to compare to eInk readers since it is powering a backlit screen.  I usually get a good full days charge out of it with heavy use.  In reality. these are so minor to me for what this little gem can do.Another thing to be aware of. you must have wifi to connect the nook to register it and set it up.  It doesnt have 3G so those who were hoping for that it isnt an option with this particular model.Now if you are sold just by the above description. there is more!  Recently Bu0026N released a major update to the nook color.  The Nook Color is now a mini tablet!  They added more features such as easy access to your emails.  Got multiple accounts?  Nook handles that in one application.  They added an app feature where you can now download apps to add even more functionality.  You have an office app. where you can create. edit word. excel documents and then save them either to your SD card or to dropbox or google documents.  They added flash capability where now virtually every page on the internet is available to you now.  They also have games available.  Lots of fun apps. but so far. it isnt a huge store but I can see it growing rapidly.  You can now also put your own ebooks you download onto the home page .not just Bu0026N books. for easy access to open that book to read.I know there are other features available on the nook that I have not tried yet. like doing movies.  You will have to convert any movies to the format that nook plays.  I will have to try that one soon.I think the only thing the nook cannot do now. is take photos. skype or instant messages.  I can see that as they improve their platform. instant messaging might come available.  Since there is no camera on the nook. it wont take pictures or skype.  For me. these are non issues.  I have a camera on my phone and a real one. which I prefer to take pictures with.  I just dont see me anytime soon wanting to hold up a large tablet to take a picture.The nook color is first and foremost a color eReader.  But it has now quickly morphed into an affordable tablet.  So if you wanted to at least try a tablet but dont want to invest a whole lot of money into one. the nook color is an affordable option.  Im not disappointed.. Im ecstatic!I just love my nook color!,5,1,4080
A1VJZ0PRN072ZP,1313,The cover is beautiful and the leather is very nice. however it was slightly too large for the 1st edition Nook reader.  It still works and I like it. Price was very reasonable and it arrived very quickly  on the day it was supposed to arrive!,4,1,243
A1VKA5J3NF7OU9,0,This cable is fine. except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending.

A1VKT6RZ1T91I1,11,This is a great receiver.  Like every Aiwa product Ive ever ownedseen its worth every penny.  Plenty of input options. and the sound quality is top notch.  I only have a few small complaints. One is that its a bit busy  looking with a plethora of buttons on the front panel.  If youre searching  for something very streamlined looking. this might not be a good choice.  And Id like to see a more useful universal remote included with a  component of this quality and cost.  The remote controls the receiver. TV.  Cable. VCR and a CD player.  Id really expect to see controls for a DVD  player. and the ability to run a CD changer and not just a single CD  player.  Sorta a waste to have a 200 disc changer and only be able to  access the 1st disc with the remote. ..,4,1,766
A1VL5F9CXYWYXB,99,I have tried numerous times to get these white noise generators working. tuned. put on head. tuned. took off head. tuned. put on head. etc.....Then the batteries went dead and it took forever to even get the red light to come on .it wanted to stay on green or a VERY DIM red .as in not connecting good enough to charge.. I guess JVC loves these so much that they just had to DROP the price from their suggested retail of USD120.00 to less then 1 sixth of that amount so the world could get this wonderful product..If you buy these I got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya...,1,0,571
A1VLJBF5CVGDRA,11,I bought this surge protector because I bought a similar surge protector for my previous laptop and it worked well.  The Pro has a better connected equipment warranty. which I think is worth paying a little bit more for.The only downside is that Dell changed the shape and design of the power brick on their new laptops. so this surge protector does not strap on to the power brick as nicely as the old surge protector I have attaches to the power brick for my old laptop. but thats not APCs fault.,5,1,498

A1VM5U1TBANV9,0,I hate this CD changer. Never have I wanted to destroy something as much as this piece of crap.I have had it for 34 years. Recently its given me a lot of problems and prior to those problems. I still have a few complaints about this unit.1. On random mode when changing CDs. its loud and slow.2. Programming groups is extremely time consuming. You have to scroll through and wait a few seconds for each disc that you want to program. If you are programming half the capacity. its a pain in the ass. And lets say I wanted to remove one of the CDs from my preprogrammed group. You cant. You have to redo the entire thing.3. Its big and bulky but light weight and cheap.After owning this thing for 3 or 4 years. I have ran into a some major problems.1. Once in awhile it wont read any of the discs. Sometimes 24 hours later. sometimes 4 days later. it decides to work again.2. Every single bloody song on every single disc .even brand new ones. SKIP. It can just be a mild annoyance with some tracks. but other times it completely stops playing the song.3. Sometimes when its changing discs on random play. it will get stuck and the cd number and track will just keep scrambling.I am a pretty thrifty .some might even say stingy. person who never throws anything away that I can sell on ebay. And I sell practically anything and everything  broken. new. old .with an accurate description. of course.. However. when I get a new cd changer. this unit is still going in the trash. Id rather destroy this piece of equipment then profit off of it. Thats how terrible this cd changer is.,1,0,1578
A1VNFF4FDP89E4,68,These work very well and the sound quality is good. I did not test it in a classroom or meeting type setting. I only used it for recording personal voice memos or to make Skype phone calls.I ordered one of these because I figured that given such a low price. if it didnt work then it wasnt much loss. I was happy with the purchase. However they are very small. I would consider ordering several because I lost mine within one week.,4,1,431
A1VNFRX2IV0YQL,0,Targus laptop lock with combo lock can change combonation on its own. I am in a dorm and decided to keep my laptop locked while I was not in my room. One day I could not get the combo to work. When I called Targus customer service they told me sometimes the combo slips on its own that I needed to try combos with surrounding numbers to the combo I had set weeks ago. It took hours of work. but after many tries found that the last combo digit had changed by one number drop. I am now going to purchase a lock with keysnever again will I use the combo lock.,1,0,557
A1VNJMI8MRVIS4,34,It works. it simply works. I can pick up my pop email from any location with an analog phone connection. .watch out. many offices have digital phone systems. which will not like this little modem. And I can also send my pop email with some freeware available out there. So all in all a great product. I can even just peek on the server to see if any relevant email is waiting out there. or if it is spam and spam again. .i am using a commercial software for this feature. so be prepared to spend a bit more money. It is nice to sit in a hotel room somewhere far from home and to read email on your little palm V .or better Vx.... it feels like working on the very first macintosh. It is all very cute. and all the words in the emails seem really important. Hmm. but there must be other solutions. I could think of wireless solutions. or solutions which would use a cellphone as a wireless modem. .look ma. no wires.... This modem is a cute solution for the wired traveler. Emails feel very fuzzy and warm. And you can write them anywhere and then send them off from almost anywhere. Oh. and before i forget. yes. you can also surf the web. .using some other commercial software which is listed in the manual.. Hmm. surfing the web on a palm is a completely different story. It just does not feel right. Amazon actually is quite surfable. but many other sites are not. It feels a bit like leaving the house but never crossing any streets. Not quite there yet. it seems.  .*. Get it. if you insist. .*. I am keeping mine. I like it.,4,1,1530

A1VRMLN1K5O4E0,36,I just returned from Germany and have some feedback. While the item is physically made well. I strongly suggest you look for an adapter that does not have pieces you need to remove to adapt. I now have a universal adapter that can no longer be used in Germany because I pulled it out of the wall and the EU adapter piece stayed in the recessed reciptical and I didnt catch it before I left. One of my traveling companions had an adapter where all of the plugs flipped out of the main box and nothing could be lost. I did like the USB feature of this one. but in reality if you take one USB charger from any of your phones .which are very small now. you can charge any USB device. I personally take my Netbook and could also charge a device from it. Also. this one sat a little loose in the reciptical and you had to be careful that they didnt separate if plugged into a wall. In summary. this device has great fetures for the money. just be careful when in the hussle of packing not to lose the piece.,4,1,1001

I use it all day at work. The mouse is shaped to  PERFECTLY fit the shape of a persons hand. In addition. it has the wheel  which is GREAT for scrolling through documents. surfing the net. and even  playing video games! Installing it is also very easy.

A1VU0SV2PQ9FRR,0,Well built and a good value. Unfortunately. and somewhat ironically. the enjoyment of the product is frustrated by its strong magnification.Assuming that one is not using a tripod AND doing so virtually at all times. these binoculars are not pleasant to use other than briefly. While magnification is important .on occasion an even greater magnification than that offered by these binoculars would be ideal. the image is made simply too jittery by the strength of the magnification.A seemingly perfect solution would be a pair of binoculars that offers the capability to toggle the magnification from say 5x  25x.,3,0,613
A1VUHTQ6GC4LH,1516,I cant complain too much  its cat5 cable. whats there to say?  Its a good price. and I like being able to get various colors because it helps with cable management.  But this cable had a different sort of plastic sheath on the connector head than I am used to and I do not like that at all.  In order to press the plastic release for the connector. you have to fit your finger between two raised edges.  Clearly this is to protect the release from the common breakage problem. and I appreciate the attempt...but this was too hard to use. couldnt release it with my thumb. had to use my index finger.  Plus you cant do it from the side. you have to have your finger at the correct angle. which can be a problem when youre under a desk with your hand snaked around behind your router or what have you.,4,1,799
A1VWGUCKF8Z621,0,I set out to purchase a DVD player to complement my already in place home theater setup. I previously had a second generation. yet ~2 year old Panasonic DVD player with the DTS output. I finally found a dealer with the  S7700 in stock and bought it. Once installed. I was thoroughly impressed  with everything but the sound. I purchased. along with the player. a  36u0026quot Sony XBR WEGA TV. and. as expected. the picture quality was  incredible. Unfortunately. I soon realized that I had a problem on my  hands. After connecting the player into my sound equipment. there was  something missing. The sound on my older player was much better than the  Sony. Caveat emptor. If you are looking for a topoftheline player.  purchase the DVPS7700. Its ease of use and picture quality are great. If  you have already invested a lot of money into a sound system that works  great with your current player. beware... you are in for disappointment.,5,1,940
A1VWJ8PXOYMXF6,6069,Ive been happy since I installed that card in my CPU. Great textures handling. smooth gaming and super fast 2d3d acceleration.

The module  that comes with the card is awesome. no more back  pain trying to plug your wire in or out. this module gives you access to  all the important inputoutput of your card in seconds !

A1VXFCKOT183U4,33,Okay. its cool looking but there are some major drawbacks even having the newest software updates. The girlfriend and I are trying both the Kindle and the Nook.  Im thing the Kindle is looking better in the long run.  Issue I have with the Nook are.1. Battery life is terrible compared to the Kindle.  I have to recharge about 8 times for every recharge of the Kindle.2. Turn off Nook = losing place in book and on a 1100 page book that means not being able to just go to page 958 it means single forward clicking to get to the page .not a very good way to keep me happy..3. Pages take an insanely long time .upwards of 3 minutes at times. when paging at the end of chapters most especially in PDF converted docs...wouldnt it be smart to cache the next couple pages ahead of time?4. Screen glare...not so fun with a reading light.Fix most of these issues and Ill be happy until then. not so much impressed.,2,0,906

A1VZP6P522ZS39,0,As most audiophiles know the Bu0026ampW brand of speakers is one of the finest money can buy .within reason..  Although I did not purchase my DM601s through Amazon.com. I did however want to share the experiences that I have had with the product.  The DM601 are the most u0026quotdramaticu0026quot book shelf speakers that I have heard in a very long time.  The richness in the lower frequencies are quite astonishing even with the small size.  The mid range is about average. and if you like listening to top 40 music I think that JBL S series is a little better for about the same price.  But for the price and the prestige of owning a pair or Bu0026ampWs this is a good entry point.  I use these for my rear channel speakers and they do quite well.  They could be used as mains. but you might not get the desired effect.  The bass is there but the mids are just a little flat.  Over all. the DM601 is a very solid performer.  If rap is what you like these are the best that money could buy for the price.,4,1,1007
A1W0CHSU0O5VUK,48,Bought this hoping it would be as good as the USD20 one at Staples. For the price...why not try it? Works great. No graininess. No interruption of transmission.

A1W3D42N13EYZ7,0,This was my third purchase of this Model.  I had been using these for listening to stations distant to my rural home for several years but this New set didnt have near the range or tone quality of the prior sets that I had purchased over the  years.  I changed to CC Radio plus Sets which do what I had wished this GE set would do.,2,0,331
A1W3ECEAMKNF0M,0,Class D citizen band provides an excelent very short distance communication.  With the FCC only legally allowing 4 watts on 11 meters your range is very limited all CBs can potentially be modified however for a illegal higher output.  Unless your running a half wave base antenna. a nice beam. or a extremely long higain mobile antenna dont expect much from this rig. or any other CB rig.  With the new FRS fad they are pounding in the 2 mile range... however this is not true because one they run in .FM.frequency modulation mode which has excelent sound but its mainly line of sight communication only. two they have extreme power restrictions and no external antennas those 350 miliwatts of power will barely get you a mile unless your in an excelent terrain.  I highly recomend AM mode for distance. however if your going to buy a CB get one with .SSB. single side band which will allow you to use a portion of an AM wave the upper or lower part.  In side band mode your 4 watt radio will produce 12 watts of legal power because you are only using the top. or bottom part of a wave without a carrier. this tends to be garbled so constant adjustment with the clarifier nobb may be neaded. As well on CB..11 meters if your lucky in the heat of the summer days the band accasionaly will open up and allow your radio wave to skip clear across the world this is rare though running such low power but it is possible and ive seen it happen.  But for those who seek the distance of radio Amateur .HAM. radio is what its all about.  The FCC has made it possible to become a liscensed ham operator without knowing morse code anymore and a 35 question test which you can pass with a 70%.  As a ham operator i can tell you its very rewarding. repeaters are free to use and usually have about a 2540 mile range which you can hit with just miliwatts of power. or for those who seek long communications it is legal to run up to 1.5 kilowatts .1500 watts. of brute power.  Although this is not neaded you can easily work the world with low power on certain bands.  And with repeater ive hit some of them next to 100 miles away running only 5 watts on 2 meter fm.  but thats all i have to say73skcmvl,2,0,2188
A1W50VDBB6NY4O,1115,These VCR tapes worked initially and then required daily cleaning of the VCR heads.  The tapes are basically unusable as a result.

A1W8VFZCX4CFBD,34,On the advice of my friend. I bought the Palm V and now I can see why he likes his so much. Its turned out to be very useful. No more forgetting tasks or being late to appointments. Anytime I need to jot something down.  i can just whip it out and start writing. And the games help pass the time  when you have nothing to do.To the reviewer who said a notepad and a pen  was the equivalent. you have no idea what youre missing.  The Palm is so  much more than a notepad. it also has games. a calendar. to do lists. an  address book. calculator. and anything else you want to load onto it. Id  like to see something made of paper as compact as the palm that could hold  as much information and deliver it as easily.,5,1,714
A1W98MNHYOZR3,2932,Overall. this floppy drive is a great value. I have used it in both Windows 8 and Linux without issue. It presents a USB Mass Storage device so it doesnt need a special driver.The floppy drives of old were heavy. high quality. and made of metal. They were also very expensive. This floppy drive is lightweight and made primarily of plastic. It is made as well as it needs to be  especially considering the very low price.Personally. I wouldnt mind paying more for more heavyduty floppy drive. but the reality is. there is no point. Floppy drives arent needed very often these days and theres no point in paying extra for a device that will get occasional use at most.,4,1,667
A1WAJUFW505ZFV,11,Our second Labtec C322 this year. and it has broken again.... one of the ears cuts out. Should be more durable than this.,1,0,121
A1WBDC76QEJLUK,811,Let me start out by saying the one not good comment. This item is a two person job due to awkward weight. All other comments I have for this mount are great. Attachable cable ring helps keep the cords neat and away from my one year old son. The mount also works great in my boys room because they are able to watch tv from anywhere in the room due to the great amount of flexibility of the swing arm. This is definitely a great buy. I strongly recommend this product for others to use,4,1,484
A1WBVTUUJ5OSOX,0,I have had my Nook Color for a few months and LOVE it. especially with the new updates.  I use it mainly for reading. but take advantage of the internet. apps. email. and Pandora features.  The kids love reading on it also.  There are plenty of free books.enter 0.00 in the search. and I am able to check out books from our library. I highly recommend the Nook.,5,1,361
A1WBWZ4LRA77EI,44,Theses jewel case inserts are fine. but the Memorex software to use them is clunky and oldfashioned. It is difficult to use and has limited features.,3,0,149
A1WCM8UONTBQWR,0,It was ok. it needs to last longer than the real charger pieces. But a good deal. just wish it would last longer,2,0,112
A1WCSVUZUWCLD8,0,The micro SD Card works well with my garmin nuvi 1450. even though I dont need the micro to SD adapter.,4,1,103
A1WCYZJEOWEQUB,0,I bought this cd changer to replace my old .ancient. one. It is easy to use. good looks. good sound.just what I wanted.  I am pleased.,5,0,134
A1WD9DNSLLB9KZ,46,It works how it is supposed to.  Ive run this cable from my wireless router to a PC in the basement. works exactly how I expected it to.,5,0,136
A1WDZM15EY2Y7,33,We liked the first one so much. that when it wore out. we bought another one.,4,0,77
A1WEYJ91O82U5F,0,It records great on my iPod Touch. but turns off the iPods builtin speaker. so it isnt so great for VOIP applications.,2,0,118
A1WFDJHDWDVGW8,1416,The sound quality is pretty good and the radio reception is very good.  Previous shower radios we had were far worse in both areas.  I especially like the programable buttons since we each like different stations.  Even though the screen fogs the LCD is still readbale.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price is a bit high for a shower radio.,4,1,367
A1WFYNRTYCG0JY,0,I bought this camera over a year ago and it was a good camera for that short period of time and the price was right.but theres not much difference in price for this piece for junk it drains the batteries everytime i download pictures from the camera.And you cant even upgrade the smart media card.,2,0,297
A1WGMIN2659UUT,2,I havent received this item yet.. it was a christmas present for a friends mom. I was hoping that it would be the smoke colored one. instead of the snow. but Im not sure since there wasnt a picture and it wasnt in the description. Im really hoping so.,3,0,251
A1WHRVTZNXSNQW,43,I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid at Radio City Music Hall in New York.  I really loved it and as DVDs became more and more popular over the years I waited anxiously for the release of Tom Sawyer.  All I can say is this.................IF A MOVIE IS FILMED IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT THEN PLEASE RELEASE IT IN WIDESCREEN ON DVD.  Dont waste your money on this until the studios wise up.,1,0,392
A1WI9IDBAP8NDM,710,This drive was not recognizable by either a Windows 7 PC or a Windows 8 tablet.  Got similar item .USD5 more. from Microcenter and it was plug and play.,1,0,152
A1WIQIN5V1B87V,0,No problems so far. holds a lot of pictures and videos. Only had it for a few weeks but seems great. And they delivered it on time.,4,1,131
A1WJGFLJ2W8GIO,0,I purchased the CD changer to replace an old technics single disc unit.  I like the carousel design vs the magazines. particularly being able to change CDs while another is playing.  I received the unit quickly. and it has performed flawlessly.  It may not have all of the features that some more pricey units have. but it has worked great for me from the start!  Definitely worth the money.,5,1,391
A1WJHA6Z2OWK2E,33,I didnt like these radios...i have returned them. Problems encountered  1. when you bump the unit .even slightly.. the batteries jump out of place and you have to open up the battery compartment and reseat them. 2. Noisy  too much static and cuts off  3. no way is this a 2 mile range. we had  trouble using them in a department store when we were one department apart.  Theyre range is very limited  maybe a couple blocks outside.These  radios are reminiscent of the old walkie talkie I got as a kid for  Christmas. although they are better than that. This may be a good kids  toy. but the battery jumping out of place will be a problem with kids.If youre interested in a radio for your family to stay in touch at the  mall. outings. etc. spend a more money and get something better...thats  what I plan on doing.,1,0,814
A1WK8EGBSHC72,5563,I would have givin the QuckCam Pro 5 stars. except that the usb version doesnt work w NT .  while this may be MSs fault .what isnt .. had I been able to have the bennies of usb w my NT workstation. I would have  been truly happy.Installation on my home 95 machine was a snap.  I was  able to goto logitechs home page and find. download and install the latest  drivers w in a few min.  They really put a nice package togeather.  Its a  snap to take a pic. and pop it off in a email to family and friends.  Video  is just as easy to take.  Great image quality for such a small package.  ..Bottom line. QuckCam Pro is worth every penny.Cheers.Starr,4,1,645
A1WL0FF6EPAGFS,33,This adapter is very good for use in a car tape player. It has a nice gold end stereo mini cable. It works just fine.,4,0,117
A1WM8DNWJ8SCEL,11,I recently upgraded my stock Hewlett Packard Pavillion 9895 speakers to the Yamaha YSTMS50W 80Watt 3Piece SubwooferSatellite Computer Speakers.  First and foremost. let me tell you one thing. wow. and I really mean WOW. what a great set of computer speakers!Understand. you dont get full blown surround sound with these speakers  few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway.  But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today. these speakers will. out of the box. work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards.  And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost.My only complaint .and it is an exeedingly *small* one. is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker .volume and onoff. and the sub woofer .base volume.  it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit .i.e. on a satellite speaker..  But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price.Netnet.1. Awesome .I would even say unsurpassed. sound quality to cost ratio2. Extremely easy setup .took me less than 10 minutes  and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room.3. Wished the connecting wires were longer .the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the subwoofer.4. Needs some industrial design tweaks .i.e. audio controls should all be in one place.5. Rich base. sweet highends. and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6. MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET,4,1,1625
A1WM9H8DE96D9,77,worked fine for my Directv DVR which is located across the room .about 12  15 ft. from the telephone jack...easy to set up .about 2 minutes.,5,0,140
A1WMEVP3FN3F8J,11,Great case. not sure how the hand stripe works and wish it had vertical stand but for the price its the best case I ever had. Very soft and smooth on the inside. Color is the best.,4,1,180
A1WMHFPD9YLVFV,0,I bought mine almost 2 years ago and it still performs flawlessly.  I espeically like the small size. light weight. and the durable and attractive aluminum housing.  The lens is very good and the controls are  easy to master.  Oh. and it takes great pictures!  This is the camera I  pack when Im hiking at 14.000 feet or when I want a small camera with me  on vacation.  I own a Nikon F100 SLR with a couple rather large and heavy  f2.8 lenses but for most of my snap shots I just use the Fuji.,5,1,494
A1WN83WJWJX24D,1414,I bought one of these to try with a set of Motorola Talkabout MR350R as recommended by the radios guide book.  Works well at first but given any time between transmissions and it wont work but same goes for the radio without the ear bud.  So I cant really say its great or it sucks.  Just know with this radio its spotty.,3,0,321
A1WN83WJWJX24D,22,Does not work with the Motorola Talkabout MR350R as advertised in the radios operation manual.  It seems well enough made but if it doesnt work then it doesnt make a difference in what I needed it for int he first place.,1,0,220
A1WNIOPMTGGTCS,0,This is a great wall mount. it fits my tv well .i have a Dynex 32 inch 720p lcd. it puts a little more strain on the mount than i would like but it has held well for the few days its been up there.Also one of the screws that you use to bolt into the wall had a round head? anyways its a great tv mount. and the instructions are easy to follow. installation took about 20 min.,4,1,375
A1WNJOHEGA1V4N,0,Freezes with some. newer. Mac applications coming out of sleep mode on my rev C iMac. I especially have trouble with Coda Music apps. A restart fixes all but ... I try to think of  it as digital syncopation ... and  moreover its Bondi Blue which doesnt match my Grape iMac ... oh woe ... Im  going out to the garden and eat worms.,4,1,330
A1WNXULJFKOU8F,24,The Elph is a great snapshot camera.  I own a 35mm SLR as well  but I never have it with me.  The Elph is so small I take it everywhere. with the result that I take many more pictures!  Its trivial to use and the picture  quality is great for a pointnshoot camera  its definitely managed to  pull some good photos out of difficult situations.  Id recommend this  model over the nonzoom models. because Ive found having the zoom helps a  lot. especially with APS .which you dont want to enlarge too much..The  only things that could make this better are a wider zoom range. and support  for midroll changes.  But with or without those. the Elph has become one  of my essential pieces of electronics!,4,1,698
A1WOG0BMUA4MOQ,1221,I wanted to send data from my old computer to my new computer.  Problem was not with the cable but with IEs transfer wizard feature now installed on Windows XP.  My new computer didnt have a 25 pin connection so I used the 9 pin connection.  Sending approx. 1Gb of data would take over 150 hrs using IE Transfer Wizard.  I found it quicker .15 minutes. and just as easy to copy what I needed to a CDR RW disk.  I think the cable is perfect for transferring data but. I would suggest using some other data transfer program.  I have not used the cable using the 25 pin connection yet. so I dont know if it would be faster.,4,1,620
A1WP0TE0ZA1HQD,0,Lots of accessories and parts...make sure you buy one in a box complete. not used.Limited use anymore. since most people use their cells. but has its place on the long highway stretches of the U.S. still.  Good backup communication.,4,1,232
A1WPDGKWL4ANIS,12,I like belkin products and need a patch cable to run from my wireless modem to my laptop it fits just right and snaps in tight,4,1,126
A1WPHNA5D03X3E,1,I have had no luck in getting the modem to work.  It sets up ok and responds to AT commands until it is asked to dial.  It immediately returns ERROR.  I have worked with the vendor service desk for over a month.  I  have tried two Macintoshes and a PC.  Ive tried 3 different phone lines  and paid the phone company to check the lines at my house.  I have edited  CCL files.  I have had two engineers and a computer technician try.  I have  swapped the modems with other modems known to work and they all work fine.  but the Zoom doesnt.  Amazons wonderful replacement policy replaced the  first modem.  The second modem does the same identical thing.  I have spent  too much time and money on something that is supposed to plug in and  operate easily.  Ill try something else.,1,0,777
A1WPRT4C4FHY5X,46,Three of these items will store 42 single DVD cases.  Two of the Domino products will store the same number of items.Just for the heck of it I calculated the total cost per DVD for both sets of items  3 cases from Case Logic and 2 cases from Domino. including shipping and handling.It works out to USD.59 per DVD for the Case Logic set and USD1.12 for the Domino set.Im about to order 3 of these Case Logic items.,4,1,413

A1WREU7PGTX98P,1,I plugged it into my computer and... nothing. Tried it in several different computers .windows 7 and windows 8. and the device is completely dead. Will not be recognized by computers. The worst part is I cannot return it as of a few days ago. I would recommend trying a different brand.,1,0,286

A1WS82HEQC885M,5,I did not have any USB ports on the front of my computer so this extension cable made it easy to transfer files to my usb drive and my media card reader.  The price was right and it the cable works everytime.,5,1,208
A1WT8IK8L6GYQJ,24,I just got this today.  I love it.  The software sucks though.  It takes a while to get used to this software.  I want to figure out a way that i can just drag and drop files instead of using their software.  Its too hard to find the files i want.  I know where all my MP3s are on my hard drives but  when they are all mixed together in the the software they give you. its  hard to find what I want to load on the MP3 player.  I would definitely buy  this product though.,4,1,471
A1WT8IK8L6GYQJ,47,I love my new Elph.  It is so tiny. I dont even notice it when Im wearing it on my belt.  I love the panoramic shots that I can take.  This camera is so compact.  The icture quality is perfect.  I have never taken a  bad picture with my Elph.  Sometimes I wish it had a zoom function in it  but I still love it.  I highly recommend this camera.  I got it for my trip  to CA.  I cant wait to take some great pictures out there.,5,1,426
A1WV6PKZTD9QD6,44,I read all the reviews possible about all the different 36 inch tv.s .and bigger.. I was either going for this one or sonys flatscreen babies. For you who are hesitating between the same tv.s. Go for this one. The screen is not flat. but its far from as round as old tv.s. its actually close to  flat I think. The tv is heavy and BIG. It almost did not go through my door  and two poor guys from Eagle USA .who deliver like no other!. dragged it up  my small stairwell to my apartment. But oh the joy. Sound is absolutely  above average .Im still getting home theater system.. Picture is sharp as  hell! .850 lines. with no strange blurrs or sharpness problems or other  things you read about on other tv.s. I havent seen ONE flaw yet! and Ive  tried a lot of freaky combinations on this tv. it kicks sonys butt. Just  look at all the other reviews about this tv! it works so well! I just  plugged in DVD. cable tv. playstation. and poof.. there it was! This is by  far the best tv I have ever owned. and as a technology freak. I highly  highly recommend this tv. Just make sure it fits in your livingroom.. hehe,5,1,1112
A1WVMDRJU19AFD,3838,For starters. the Govideo has enough surface area to support alarge TV directly on top of it. The value of having two decks goesway beyond bootlegging. and promulgating your edited camcorder masterpiece.  Its the luxury of putting in two different movies. and deciding which one to watch at the last minute.  Or rent Braveheart. put 1 and 2 in at the same time no need to mess around at halftime. With The Godfather. youll have two switch once. The 4 head action allows for clean slowmotion and visual fast forwarding. and it goes from u0026quotstopu0026quot to u0026quotplayu0026quot in under two seconds. When copying a tape. dont be afraid to hit slomo for your favorite scenes .this goes especially for home videos. It will be a good laugh the second time around. The Govideo is pure horsepower under the hood.  In an era where DVDs will inevitably put VHS to rest. its one of the few VCRs out there that you will get compliments on.  It may be excessive for some people. for others its really functional and HiFi. justifying the cost premium over the singleshooters.,4,1,1071
A1WVMDRJU19AFD,4344,I have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive  My universitys graphics computers have zip drives. the local Kinkos have zip drives in their computers. my parents even have a zip drive now.  Its a nice. accepted standard. and for the price the disks read fast and work well unlike 3.5  floppies. no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me. Zip disks are made of  sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your .shirt. pocket without  damage.The strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the 120 MB  superdrive. which is a drive that is backwardscompatible with 1.6 MB  .traditional.3.5 floppies. so you can totally replace your old floppy drive  and still have it when you need it.  A couple years ago it was expected  that this drive would blow Iomega zip out of the picture. but  superfloppies havent really caught on.In terms of exchanging data  between computers in the same house. it is suprisingly simple to run an  ethernet network instead and there are other advantage besides transfering  files such as printer sharing and web sharing.Note.  I think the zip  100 is more functional for the price than the 250 zip. .For backing up  really large files. the best thing these days is a cd writer or rewriter..,5,1,1225
A1WVMDRJU19AFD,2628,Ive gone from the palmpilot pro two years ago to the palm III and now have the Palm V. so I definitely appreciate how small and thin the V is. and how much clearer the screen is than on the previous models. A few months ago my  palm V fell from a stack of books on to the floor face down. shattering the  screen.  I called 3com. and they charged me 100 dollars to replace it. and  sent a refurbished one that came in two days.  I was satisfied with the  process. and its good to know that they understand how important it is to  be back in action fast as possible.The leather flip cover that comes  with the V works very well to protect the screen while in your pocket. and  eventually begins to have the comforting worn leather feel of a wallet.  which adds to the over aesthetics of this product.  A less obscure point is  that it becomes very easy to get attached to carrying the palm V around  just as much as you carry a wallet.I can use the infrared port on the  palm V to connect to my GSM phone .ericsson i888 on omnipoint.. and get  regular internet access.  .requires proxinet. irdalink software. and a  standard isp..  Its not the most functional thing in the world but it  actually works.  There is so much good shareware out there for the palm  .tetris. document readers and books. finance calcs. customizing hacks  etc... and even a computer novice can easily learn how to download and  install new programs with relative ease.,5,1,1441
A1WVMDRJU19AFD,2021,Like other people have said before me. this modem wont break through the 50Kbs barrier. My external xircom .serial port. modem could connect at 53 kbs on the same line. .The effective difference between 49 kbs and 53 kbs  is negligible though. so who cares.The drivers for this modem loaded  easily the first time. and when I cleaninstalled win2000. they  automatially reinstalled. no questions asked.On a side note. This modem  supports the rare 3.3 volt standard. .Some highend workstations and  servers use the 3.3 volt standard. but everyone else uses the 5 volt  standard so this doesnt matter for most people.  3 volts is an  u0026quotemergingu0026quot standard which will probably never catch on.. Most pci  modems only fit into 5 volt PCI slots. A 3.3 volt pci card slot has  different gooves so that you cant mistakenly put a 5 volt card into it.  The supramax is compatable with both. .Silicon Graphics pointed me towards  the supramax after I struck out with another modem..Closing comments.  This modem has served me well. but now it collects dust inside my computer.  thanks to my cable modem.  Its still nice to know that its there for me.  and I use it occasionally to test how long my sites take to load for the  .notyetbroadbanded. people,4,1,1255
A1WVMDRJU19AFD,1719,first of all. this is a 10100mbs card. which means it will be faster than a 10mbs card if your your network is 100mbs+.  Though network cards are fairly boring and undifferentiated products. I like this one here are 4  reasons why.1.The dongle has THREE indicators lights. thats three  times as many as most other dongles.  Also. it feels like a sturdy fit.  that wont snap off that easily.2.The Blue rj45 cable is a smooth. out  of the ordinary color. that reminds you that you have a stylish netgear  card stuck inside.3. The drivers loaded noprobs on my good old dell  lattitude 133mhz. which is on windows 2000 now. .my 3 year old Xircom card  just broke..4. It matches my Netgear .7 port 10100mbs. hub. which I  have grown to like because it looks good and works well. so I am becoming a  loyal Netgear fan.I gave them 4 out of 5 stars because after all. it is  still just a network card.,4,1,893
A1WVMDRJU19AFD,1415,Im biased towards this product because I really like SMDK .SmartDisks ticker symbol..  If you decide to buy this excellent adapter which SMDK has the exclusive on. buy a couple shares of it as well. and it will pay for  itself.The flashpash works fine in my NT machine. opens those smartmedia  cards just like floppies.Although not its primary intended use. I use  it to back up a couple important files. and have them on a little  smartmedia card  kind of like James Bond.  It nice to have an hour of good  music on a square guitar pick.The usb smartmedia reader works faster.  but the flashpath is a really cool concept. and they are more compatible  everyone has a floppy drive. right?I wouldnt recommend .the Flashpath  adapter. if you have a laptop with an external floppy it might not work in  it.And you might want to pick up a couple of the little batteries.  because heavy tranfers eventually eat the little watch batteries up.,5,1,936
A1WW41U29ZO41K,1111,Got a Nook for Christmas and Ive already plowed through two books. Its a very small. light device with a very simple display and interface. Its for reading books... thats it. And it does it perfectly. I already prefer this thing to real books as its easier to read in bed with having to hold open a book and turn pages. The eink display is easy on the eyes and doesnt give you screen fatigue as theres no backlight. I LOVE THIS THING!,5,1,434
A1WWEM323CGDYO,22,I liked the item but it was the wrong style that my daughter wanted.  She decided to get the glowlight,4,1,102
A1WX6T2ZD0V62P,1,It fits nicely and doesnt move too much when locked. Its not a fullproof lock but it would definitely slow a perp down. What I mean by this is it could be ripped out pretty easily but that would damage the casing. making it that much easier to track down and catch the perp.,4,1,274
A1WXDWWX302SXE,0,I bought is for my sis in law for her birthday and she really enjoys it. shes only had it a couple days and has already downloaded so many books.,4,1,145
A1WYOITCEMFM9G,0,The adapter that arrived was not the same as pictured. But that didnt bother me. It works pretty well for the price. It has made a weird sound a few times but then it stops.,3,0,173
A1WZSFDJ67KGUL,0,This is a cool portable radio. Yes its old school. No digital tuning. no alarm clock. no presets etc. It does not pretend to be state of the art. You are buying a classic. In my sample. the radios components are well done  smooth. and put together well. What really sets this radio apart is the quality of the sound it produces. Clear. bright and as loud as any reasonable person should need. I listen to NPR and it sounds like the people are in the same room with me  very nice. Music is also reproduced to my satisfaction. I have a Sangean that is a nice radio with bells and whistles. However. the quality of sound is muffled and the volume level is very limited. I cant fully comment on the RCAs AM reception because I prefer FM broadcats and rarely listen to AM. However. the AM reception seems on par with my Sangean. I believe this is a well done product that will appeal to many people looking for a solid performing table top radio.,4,1,941
A1X0990QXMJIY7,0,I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine. if you dont move your head. Now its October and the sound in that ear is gone for good. That good price for noise cancelling headphones. isnt so great for only 5 months. Guess they are meant to be disposable.Dont waste your money!,1,0,367
A1X0RJ7ZNI0PHK,55,It is a good product from JVC unfortunately. it doesnt do DTS decoding. DTS has been slow to take hold in the consumer world with very few titles currently available on DVD.,4,0,173
A1X1DS4OWX7WJK,2139,For the money it works fine. but it will take two people to mount your TV to the bracket.  The bracket and mount are sturdy enough but it will not articulate as smoothly as some of the higher priced models.  Also. do not bother with the bubble level as it is cheaply made and will not provide an accurate reading.I will keep this one as I already mounted up the TV. but the next unit I buy will be a higher priced. easier to articulate mount.,3,0,442
A1X24ECIXZSLT5,0,I have had the C322 for over a year. and overall give it a fair to good rating.  But. the left side connecting to the earpiece recently broke off.I have listened to MP3s files. WAV files and CDs with the earphones. and have done voice recording with the microphone.  I have listened to everything from ACappella to drum solos.  Sound quality when listening has been impressive and excellent.The quality of sound input from the microphone is also good. with little to no static.The only gripe I have about this is the mediocre durability of this product.  Because the earpiece is twistable. that made it easier to break .which happened..  Sound and mic still work though.,4,1,670
A1X24OU24GIGWR,44,This boombox sounds really great for a compact unit.  It has all the features one would need to use.  The sound that comes from this machine is quite remarkable.  One would think that a  small boombox would equal to  u0026quotsmallu0026quot sound. however. not in this case.I have a small table  in the kitchen area which makes a good place to put it.All in all. this  boombox delivers good sound and reliability.,5,1,413
A1X2PVXLTM61RM,45,I have only had the Nook Color for about a year and a half and the first 95% of that time. I was thrilled with it. It worked absolutely perfectly and there no problems whatsoever.  Then. in September or so. it started shutting itself off without any provocation especially when I was on the internet. After it happened a few times. I took it to one of the local B u0026 N bookstores and a Nook salesperson gave it a software upgrade. Everything was fine for about 2 days and then it happened again and got even worse.  I took it back to the store and was told by a different Nook person that there was nothing he could do because the problem wasnt presenting itself right then and there which really ticked me off.I called tech support and the person there was helpful and had me do something called a  factory reset  which basically set the device back to what it was when I first got it except all the reading material I had purchased was still there and just needed to be downloaded. For 2 weeks. the Nook went back to working great  but then it started happening AGAIN and I started emailing tech support. We went back and forth for a while .they recommended doing the factory reset again. but basically there was nothing else to be done and this problem didnt happen too often. I was told I could purchase a certified preused Nook but I have been unemployed since July and I cant afford anything like that.I was in a  different Bu0026N bookstore last week and mentioned it to one of the Nook people there and she confided that the old ones were programmed by Barnes and Noble while the brand new .and of course more expensive. Nook HDs were programmed by Microsoft and probably worked better and lasted longer. Its a shame because this was given to me as a gift and was not a cheap thing to purchase and I think its awful that it didnt even last 2 years.  Next time. I will do more research and hopefully get something better. Shame on you Barnes and Noble!!!!!!!!!,2,0,1970
A1X3DA7C61WZLQ,12,This is. by far. the best radio you can buy for AMFM reception.  The AM reception is fantastic. with a superlarge internal AM antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hardcore DXing.  FM reception is so good you dont need the AFC function. but is only in monaural.  Tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners.  There is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing.The six Dcell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms. power outages. and to tune in faroff stations without electrical interference.  The power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources.The sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble. which is perfect for attenuating static and whine.  The speaker is enormous and the radio features a highquality tweeter.  The sound quality both on AC and batteries is superpowerful.The volume and basstreble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but thats the only complaint I have.  The antenna is easily replaced if damaged.  It seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not waterresistant.I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts.  There appears to be some variance in quality between units. such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion. but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker.  Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency youre tuning. but I dont think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.This is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale.  The regular price is excessive. though. even for this level of quality.**EDIT**  In 2010. this radio is now known as the RCA Superadio III.  Model numbers include RCA 72887 and RCA RP7887.  I am listening to the original. reviewed item right now. and Im glad to see the line is still being produced even if it is under the throwback RCA brand.,5,1,2023
A1X3WFWCUTM7GN,1919,This is the second time I have purchased Brother TZ231 12mm laminated black ink on white tape from Amazon that was defective.  The roll malfunctioned. whole roll was unusable after the first printed label.,1,0,205
A1X41XUXPH5RH8,0,As long as you dont set your expectations too high... This thing does what it says on the tin. Wireless weather proof speaker. I use it in the bathroom and it provides me of music while Im in the loo or shower... And I love it. I didnt expect top level sound reproduction from a stand alone. wireless plastic speaker... and I did not get it... Ive got it hooked up to the preout of my Onkyo micro system and it works just fine as long as I keep it at least 1m away from my cordless phone. It takes some time tuning the speaker and the base unit but after that its simple as onoff. if you want HiFi music in the garden. pool or bathroom... Youll have to pay for it.,4,1,664
A1X42E08R2BBR7,44,The unit is fairly user friendly. but takes some getting used to in order to get as close as you can to a u0026quotturn by turnu0026quot unit  if you have the time to input your route before you go.  Its not what youre looking for if youre lost and want to quickly know how to get from your location to your desired location.  From the power on to the power off. its a pretty well thoughtout unit. but its a far cry from the more sophisticated .and much more expensive. models found elsewhere.  Be prepared to spend some time getting used to inputting addresses and waypoint information using a mousetype cursor and enter button.  The screen could be a bit larger. but the graphics are good quality.  Have not had a chance to fully debug the Metro Guide yet. so will add more when Ive played with that portion.  All in all. its worth the ... or so you should pay .... is too much..  Think this is a good bridge between earlier models and the affordable u0026quotturn by turnu0026quot models that will be out in a few years.  A toy. but a useful one!,4,1,1049
A1X4WK0D96JXKZ,1115,The Sony DCR TRV310 works _very_ well as a Windows XP camcorder.  Windows XP Professional include Windows Movie Maker.  This elcheapo freebee isnt adequate.  In 2002. Microsoft released a free upgrade.  Windows Movie Maker 2.  Version 2 ROCKS.  With a whole host of new camera effects. a zoo of fades. excellent title and credit control. and very controllable multiple audio tracks. its possible to do quite a bit of movie editing. without paying a dime more for software.  Version 2 even allows you to rerecord your finished video back onto the camera!I bought my Sony DCR TRV310 used .partly broken..  Since the inputoutput connections dont work properly. I just plug my TRV310 into the FireWire port. and use Windows Movie Maker 2s capture mode to control the camcorder  right on the computer screen!I sent somebody some video I had shot. stored as a .WMV file on a CDR.  He sent me back a note thanking me for the DVD!!!This model is aging. and its cost is going down.  Since it does everything youll want. including playing back 8mm and Hi8 tapes directly into Windows XP in digital format. its still an excellent buy  and an even better value than ever!Windows Movie Maker 2s minimum computer requirements are. CPU 1.500 Mhz .1.5 GHz.. 512 K RAM. lots of disk space .20 GB+.. and a FireWire port.  Since Windows Movie Maker 2 uses Microsoftspecific storage formats. you may want to spend a few USDUSDUSD to purchase thirdparty video editing software. which will record to more formats. or give you DVD authoring capability.Suggested equipment upgrades for the TRV310.  External clipon microphone for better forward gain u0026amp extended bass sound 8hr InfoLithium battery HIGHLY recommended.,5,1,1698
A1X5QZ3SHWW74P,55,I got this device today and its been great so far. It came with 2 cords. but seems to only need the 1 data cord to function .at least on my ASUS EEE PC.. Ive been using it for the last few hours to watch a season of House and theres no real heat change. The flashing light can be kind of annoying. but thats likely on most drives.,5,1,330
A1X5V94WCS0QM4,22,The sound quaility of the Eiger MP3 Player is awsome. so much better than a disc Man.  But the instructins are terrible and provide no help of any sort.  Even being computer lit. it was very hard to understand the process.  It also gives you about 34 different programs to use and I have  no idea what they are all for.  Overall. I am very pleased with the  product. just no the programs or instructions.,1,0,404
A1X8YM80GSTO66,711,This is a very high quality leather case with good hardware.  My laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything.  The almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords.  There isnt a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge.  The velcro flap fastners are noisey and overdone.  A few snaps would have been much better.  Other than that the quality is first rate.,4,1,439
A1X9Z0FJ30H6E,0,The Nook Color is a AWESOME. Product!!!! The only thing is it came with a crack across the front of the screen. My daughter had waited for it so she didnt wnt me to send it back. it doesnt go in her line of vision so we kept it. It would be nice if I could have purchased a warranty like in the stor.e,4,1,301
A1XB6PZJBJ6D2S,0,I bought this as a scout  was looking for an alternative to ear bud style headset for people.  Very good headset especially for the price.  Used in noisy environment. no problem hearing or being heard.  Only drawback was that it did become uncomfortable to wear. but that was only after 2 straight hours of use.,4,1,311
A1XBOHJY885ETZ,1,I bought this mini microphone for my 3G Ipod Touch. works like it says. Im in a band and used it to record live sound in a small room. sound quality wasnt perfect however it was good enough for my use of having the instrumental handy when away from practice. Fits my needs.,4,1,273
A1XCNW6XNRHZY4,0,I got my Nook Tablet about two weeks ago. I couldnt be happier. I use it a lot more than I thought I would. I barely use my laptop anymore. I use my laptop for word processing and storing documents but for surfing the web. checking emails and watching moviestv. I prefer my Nook. Ive hardly had time to use it for reading books. It does work great for reading. especially at night. I have also used the free trials on several magazines. The magazines look great.The apps are sufficient for me. There definitely isnt a huge selection compared to android smart phones but there are plenty for me and they seem to be increasing on a regular basis. I also wouldnt mind having a camera for scanning. I have found some quality games and activity apps for my kids and a several for me.The video playback with Netflix is great. The screen is excellent. I was really surprised to see how clear and crisp it is. Its also really easy to view the screen from an angle. So if someone else is holding the Nook its still easily seen from the side.The kids books Ive tried are a lot of fun. My kids love the interactive aspects and the ability to record and hear themselves reading .usually in a silly way..Its easy to navigate. My fiveyearold son can already make his way to the apps and videos fairly well.I have no complaints yet. It has exceeded my expectations. especially considering the price.,5,1,1384
A1XD6I2RTLISMZ,33,This is the worst product Ive ever purchased.  It didnt work at all.  Tried it with 3 devices and didnt work .  It said you could use it with an mp3 player and an iPod didnt work.  Neither did other devices with standard jacks.  This went into the garbage five minutes after it was opened.  SO DISAPPOINTING,1,0,307
A1XD710QD1HCI1,11,This antenna isnt going to provide great range or performance. but it works OK in situations where you cant easily hard wire a CB antenna.  I installed it on my travel trailer window. to avoid drilling a hole in the roof or exterior wall. Works fine for short range CB communications in the campground. which is all I wanted to begin with.,4,1,339
A1XDHHQ549Q2JI,0,the fit is rather comfortable. though the earcups only rotate around 1 axis. versus 2 as in better headphones.the sound is loud and bright. but reception is not ideal.  its not that it ever loses the signal. but rather the noise is often audible. even when used in same room as transmitter.  certainly NOT for music buffs. but i bought it for use with television for which this is sufficient.also tuning is manual. and though you theoretically only need to set it once. it would still make for a sleeker product if it automatically locked to the correct frequency. after all. you dont need to tune your cordless phone do you?  battery indicator would be another useful feature that was ommited. the way you find out that battery died is when you suddenly lose reception for no reason. it comes back after you replace the batteries.this unit features a built in charger. but i use my microprocessorcontrolled MAHA charger. and NIMH batteries.all in all. you cant ask for more at this price. but you can definitely ask for more ..,4,1,1028
A1XDQKJG1DES2D,23,the unit did not work when I travled out of the country... waste of money. I expected a quality product from Belkin but did not get what I expected.,2,0,148

A1XEYWWDJ09OEA,24,I wasnt willing to pay USD100 for simply mounting a TV. so I bought this item to give it a shot. I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up. which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points. so if youre planning on moving it around a lot. dont use this one. but if its going to stay in a static area. this is your mount.,4,1,336
A1XFALYKSGP0Q4,0,I probably wasnt using it for the right application. but it didnt work for me and wasnt worth trying to return. I just tossed it.,1,0,129
A1XFD74W0YGOJH,0,This remote and all other Jensens are horrible. normal TV works ok. but buttons sometimes stick.  But the direct TV aspect is horrible.the guide almost never works. even when the remote is 2 centimeters away from the  receiver. In other words. DO NOT BUY!,1,0,255
A1XFHYGPSSHLVM,910,On the contrary to the review u0026quotDont waste your time.u0026quot HPs CDRRWs are the highest quality out there.  According to HPs website. HP makes the best CDRRWs in the industry .at least so far..  Their CDRRWs has the longest data retention. are less likely to error. and are much more durable than bargain brand discs.  There is a reason for their expensive price tags.  If your data is extremely valuable .such as for important backups. go with HP CDRRWs.,5,1,464
A1XFI340SHOS5K,44,I used these to make covers for slim lined cd jewel cases. The photo and music list lined up perfectly. without adjustment because I used Memorex jewel cases. The only issue I had was with the design software. I never could figure out how to import the list from my burn program into the templet for the covers. All the icons and instructions were clear. but the did not work. I could see the list download from the cd in the drive. and it showed up in the software library. but it would not insert into the proper frame on the cd cover.  Ended up typing it in manually. Also missing was any button to control the layers between the text and the photo. it defaults to placing text first then inserting your photo. I could not find a way to bring the text to the foreground. So I reversed the process. placing the photo first and then the text on top.The paper quality was thick enough for use in the slim case. however I wish it had a gloss to it. The photo came flat and a bit muted. even after changing out all the ink in the printer.Used this for a give away music cd for a party. It was fine for what I was doing. however I would not use it on a professional work project.,4,1,1176
A1XG38WOY3LY4V,0,I should preface this by saying I also own a nook .non color 3g. and an iPad 3gI order a LOT from amazon so when it came down to getting an ereader it was a tough choice to pick Bu0026N over amazon.Why did I do this?I still LOVE the value of a retail store. living down the street from a Bu0026N i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books. There have been plenty of books that by their cover .yes i judge. and short summary I wouldve bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books. you really cant experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said. I decided to support Bu0026N because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy. the Android interface is fast and reliable. not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it. I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at USD250 .buy directly from Bu0026N. you cannot complain. Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.,4,1,1848
A1XG4SJMTT3N3W,78,I am very dissatisfied with this purchase.  My wall charger broke so I made this purchase...it now takes me 3 times longer to charge my phone battery completely.  I have tested with my husbands charger from phone manufacturer and it still charges fast so its definitely this wall charger that is junk.,2,0,301

A1XH0LVRYXFAPZ,11,I recently bought one of these stereos and I must say Im very happy with it. The sound is really clear and the bass is really strong. just as advertized. Sometimes it can even be too much. so turning the s. woofer to  u0026quotmidu0026quot is better. Even at a high volume the sound is still quite  clear. There are plenty of preset configurations for the EQ and theres  still the manual option. for those like me who sometimes dont like the  preset settings. However. the system is not perfect. .. As mentioned  before. it takes a while to openswitch CDs and theres no way to know if  a tray already has a CD or not. If theres only one tray empty. but you  dont know which. it can take a while to find which that empty tray. Its  one of those things you u0026quotcan live with.u0026quot however. Its a great  stereo and its worth its value.,4,1,841
A1XH86OU75RY6Y,66,This product does its job once you learn how to properly operate it. I first tried it on my wifes new hp laptop and it worked well. Then I decided to try it on my macbook and it actually pulled the plastic frame away from the screws on the left side leaving a small hole in the frame. I quickly removed it from my macbook. Since it didnt stay on my macbook long it doesnt seem to have caused any permanent damage but buyer beware if you are using this on a macbook. It will damage the frame.,4,1,491
A1XHMJALS2TR2B,45,I guess I wasted my money on this. because both vcrs I tried to use it in just automatically reject it and turn off.  I followed the directions on the tape of trying to hit record instead of play when I put the cleaner in. and that did no good either.  The players just turn off and kick the tape out.  Just know when you buy it. this may happen.  I guess its time to get something else.,1,0,387
A1XIJOAN8M6YK7,99,Ive had the CoolPix 950 for several months.  I did quite a lot of research prior to the purchase and it paid off. this is a great camera.  The other reviews cover all the pros and cons quite well so Ill put a different spin with my problems.  No problems with the camera or performance. the camera does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Most folks problems seem to be mismatched expectations or not understanding the technology.  My issues. and I cant seem to find help anywhere. so if anyone has advice. Id appreciate it.1. Learning the real differences between all the combinations of Size and Quality.  I purchased Corel PhotoPaint 9  Digital Camera Edition for not to much USDUSDUSD and like it a lot but the size. resolution. compression. quality. etc. choices just blow me away.  I have found a lot of people with digital cameras but who really dont understand this part of the technology and Nikons manuals and reference guides do not really help the digital novice.  I learned my photography over 30 years ago before automatic cameras of any kind existed and I still struggle with understanding the digital formats. I have 2 books on order from Amazon that I hope will educate me.2. Nikon external flashes are too expensive.  Has anyone found a thirdparty flash that works well with this camera?All in all a wonderful camera and Amazon has the best prices and service.  Email me at info@mainelywood.com if you have questions or info I could use.I added rechargeable batteries. the filters. a  card reader. and a 96 mb CompactFlash card from SanDisk .called Nikon. manual says only up to 64mb but Nikon has since tested Lexar and SanDisk of larger capacities and approves them..  I found Nikon tech service to be be very good. guess it depends on who you get.,4,1,1768
A1XIKZGU3MW6P2,88,I received a malfunctioning unit and have returned it .hence the low rating..  Im sure that it was just a fluke. lots of good reviews on this unit. but I wanted to warn people about the overall size of this thing.I know a 5 disc changer is going to be deep because of the size of the tray needed to accomodate the discs. but this thing is huge.  Didnt fit into my entertainment center because too deep as well as too wide.  Actually it is really tall too.  Be sure to check the dimensions of your area before you purchase this unit.In case youre wondering about the problem.  The unit powered up first time. I hit the openclose button and it opened but with a loud whiney sound.  Then it took me about 5 minutes of hitting the close and exchange buttons before I could get the thing to close.  It just kept making that same whiney sound everytime I hit the button.  Finally it closed never to open again.  Now it is completely unresponsive. powering it up lights the display. but cant get it to do a thing.,1,0,1006

A1XJOB3LXJ5E1P,3132,Received product in a very timely manner.  Packing and shipping were excellent.  Have limited the rating to .3. stars for following.1. Product is not 624 mhz as advertised but 312 mhz.  This did not affect my use but it was not as advertised.2. Spare Main Battery would not charge.  Ordered a replacement and it fit the x30 with no problems and charged up within expected time period.3. Took some time learning how to send email.  Instructions from downloaded instruction manual from Dell were not much help.  Mostly learned by trial and error.Upon receiving the initial review of 3 stars. the supplier contacted me and offered to ship a new battery and give a partial refund because of the misstated mhz of the unit.  I was very impressed with their followup and the sincerity to correct the issues.  Because of their demonstrated concern to be a responsible supplier and their followup. this review is being upgraded to 4 stars and I would not hesitate to order from them again.,4,1,980

A1XK4O47V918TK,0,At the 28 dollars I paid. this is a great deal.  Solidly constructed and pretty easy to install. even with the badlytranslated instructions.I recommend putting in just the top screw at first. and then installing the other screw after attaching the monitor.  That will let you adjust for any slight tilt created by torque on the monitor arm.*UPDATE*  It looks like theyve changed the product.  Those large arms that stick out from the corners in the photo arent present on my unit.  They may just be an addition. which would make it an even better deal.  Or they may have changed everything.,4,1,590

A1XMNRX9WW7JXR,22,Like several other reviewers. the product ruined the picture.  I read some comments on other negative reviews and can say that there were no other variables at play in my case.

Another head cleaner returned the picture except for color distortion in one stripe.,1,0,451

A1XNI66BLYHVOD,0,I saw this offered ... which seemed like a good deal after reading a few reviews and seeing it sold elsewhere.  Now that Ive used it. Im pretty impressed with the ability to progam and synchronize it with my PC. as well as find codes for download from the internet from other people who have the remote.I have two problems with this remote though. one is the dim LCD and the second is that Harman Kardon and Microsoft have discontinued manufacturing it and ceased developing software updates for it.,4,1,499

A1XOX87IOIJ9IJ,1,I got my Rio 300 for Xmas. and it is great! Unlike CD players. it is small and fits in your pocket. if you get net music. you can litsten to it off your computer or without spending money on a CD Writer and blanks. and  it never skips! I only have two peeves. When put in your pocket. the  buttons sometimes get hit and the player starts doing things you dont want  it to. And. The LCD display for track number is bad. It goes. in this  order. 1. a 7 with a section missing. 7. a seven with another section  missing. and so on. Still. pretty good!,4,1,547
A1XOZP8WHL148F,33,Pros. Cheap. readily available. Charges both NiMH and NiCd batteriesCon.  Charges all batteries the same amount of time .not smart.. must charge batteries in pairs .except 9v.. high capacity batteries will not be fully charged.I bought this unit because I trusted the Energizer name brand. and I wanted a good battery charger since my daughter has lots of toys that are using batteries fast.  the first thing I did not like is that batteries .except 9V . must be charged in pairs.  Well. some toys have odd numbers of batteries. what then?  I then found out that the energizer C rechargeables that I bought hold only 2500 mAh .eventhough they say HIGH ENERGY.. the same as a AA. so they do not last too long.  I decided to look online and found this company  .....They sell the BCH1HU and also some bundles with high capacy .10000 mAH. C batteries. this is a smart charger. can charge odd number of bateries and is a much better unit.,2,0,934

A1XQEYP8NDJIGH,22,Good deal.  Easy to install.  If your walls are cement behind dry wall no problem but youll need a cement drill bit.  Measure the back hole inputs of your tv to make sure the holes match before buying this.  Some 32 inch tvs have large rectangular holes versus smaller squared off holes.  The forward tilt is good but theres no way to adjust level so make sure the mount to the wall is correct.,4,1,394

A1XSQ7G3AH3JNR,0,I got my Diamond Rio about 1 month ago. I like the product but it has acouple of defaults.  The battery lid is very weak.  It opens up constantly and the onboard memory sucks.  It should have more memory. They also need  to make a higher capacity flash card.  If they did that it would be great.  Also the LCD display needs to be backlit because in the dark i am lost on  the track  and stuff.,3,0,393

A1XTVPYSKWKNDR,24,I had to choose a rating. but 1 star is too good for this modem. This modem was too good to be true.I read the reviews and still bought it.The actual install didnt go bad but I kept getting u0026quotno dialtoneu0026quot error. So I switched back to my old moden and downloaded the newest drivers  from BestData.They were the same as the cd in the box.With the newest  dated driver there was no dial tone. with the older driver it  worked.Connected at 49+.After about 3 minutes the speakers went crazy.I  gave up. I put my 33k  Zoomlink back and am returning this JunkData modem tomorrow.I was told by  the store.Office Max.that when this modem works it works very well. and  that it works for about 85% of their customers.However. judging by these  other reviews I am in the Majority. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS  MODEM.The time that I spent trying to use it was worth more than the modem  itself. STAY AWAY,1,0,912
A1XU1S5VO79WHK,33,I use these for my digital piano. so the neighbors dont get sick of my practicing.  They fit well. the adaptor fits nicely into the piano. and they give good. clear sound.  Very happy with them.,4,0,194
A1XU4KM5DJK3T5,22,I recently purchased a Grundig 960.  Satisfaction with this radio depends entirely on whether one wants a cool retrodecorator piece. or a functional radio.  It is definately overpriced as merely a radio!  However. if you are looking for a modern. solid state reproduction of a classic 1950s tube style worldband radio. this might be for you. It does feel heavy and wellbuilt. and certainly looks cool.  It does pick up shortwave broadcasts ok but not great.  FM u0026 AM is adequate but not great.  The radio is made in China. and is not the German made quality and precision that I expected.  Overall. the radio is not really the highquality construction that I expected from a Grundig product.  Consult Sangean products for high quality shortwave radios if that is really what you want.Alternatively. if you really prefer a modern quality radio. maybe a digital system would be a better choice.Please be advised that this radio performs. by design. as an old technology. analog radio right down to the cruddy low intensity backlighting.  It does pick up .rather impressive actually. shortwave broadcasts.  However. reception is not onpar with less expensive digital shortwave radios.Please dont interpret this review as overly negative. but you do need to be clear on what you want with this radio.  If you want primarily a decorator piece. it might be for you.  If you want primarily a functional piece. .this might not be for you..,3,0,1435
A1XUN376KSS61C,1314,I bought the Rio mp3 player last Xmas and I have used it everyday since!  It is so cool! Installation is so easy. and when it comes to putting songs on the player. its even easier.  I highly recomend this product.  Its worth  the money!  Buy it now!  Its even upgradeable to hold more and more songs!,5,1,300
A1XZX5A3SHSX3O,55,Im very pleased with this mini headset for the price.  Although the construction is somewhat flimsy. it is lightweight and does not make your ear lobe ache after wearing it for a lengthy time.  It has certainly increased the safety of my driving when talking on a cell phone.  The quality of the earphone reception and microphone transmission is as good or better than the cell phone itself.My one disappointment is that the 2.5 mm plug provided will not fit Nokia 51006100 Series phones.  An adapter is available through Plantonics .Model WTANK610. to link this headset with the cell phone. ...  So instead of purchasing two headsets for under .... it ended up costing me over ... for the two by the time the adapters were found and purchased.  If you own a Nokia cell phone. it may be cheaper overall to purchase a more expensive headset with a plug that already fits the phone.,4,1,880
A1Y09QLADQYQJG,88,No. I wasnt referring toTJ Wisemen RCFM222 Remote Controlled Fart Machine No. 2I mean. some times a dry cleaner works better than a wet one. Often Ill do a dry one.then follow it up with a wet one likeMaxell VP200 VHS Wet CleanerI wouldnt recommend a WET one followed by a DRY one... that might bind you all up orsomething.

A1YCDZ4K4G0CN3,0,In its own world. the Rio is great.  Just an MP3 Player with 65 Meg ram.  Needs better headphones. although they feel snug and secure.  Also. it  would have been nice to have a recording feature with built in Mic or Input  for a Lapel Mic.  That would blow minidisk out of the water.  I must say  however that this is the future at its best.  No moving Parts. removable  Smart Media Cards used to expand memory.  The Future of music does not  involve any motors of any kind to spin a disk.  Ive allready downloaded a  ton of online books and music. and the quality is great......and remember.  MP3s can be be converted back to a standard .Wav file with just about any  MP3 editor....Try Music Match......A great product David_Carlin@vtel.com,4,1,741
A1YCDZ4K4G0CN3,1111,This is my first DVD after thinking about it for two months.  Ive only purchased it since DVDs are entering the Rental market.

The sound can  still be decoded for dolby surround.  Great Buy!,5,1,343

A1YCN4DL7O67OA,1,I put on a pair of noisecancellation headphones in Best Buy one day. and I was hooked.  Unfortunately the set I put on cost nearly USD200 and was sold out.  The following day. I saw these while I was grocery shopping in a WalMart and thought I should give them a chance.Opening the package. I instantly noticed the cheap materials this product was made from.  The cord was too thin. the battery compartment had a snap closure that poorly fit. and the fabric over the cans was misaligned and had overcut hanging out.Turning on the noise cancellation was just as disappointing.  I immediately heard a hissing through the headphones. and barely noticed any reduction of background sound .a movie on TV..  I flipped the switch on and off to see if I could notice any reduction. and after a few minutes of testing. I discovered even their effective noise cancellation was 030% at the most.  My big can headphones with passive cancellation performed this well. and the sound quality is significantly better.  I took them back the as soon as I could.I recommend you do not purchase this product. and not to purchase any noise cancellation product without trying it first hand or making sure the store has an excellent return policy.,1,0,1225

A1YHZBM3LXLD3B,3,I bought this card to go in my Cricket broadband modem which I got at a yard sale for cheap. It isnt required. and it was just another way to store data if I decided I need to keep a backup for my tunes or whatever. The card arrived very quickly. packaged well. in excellent condition. It was exactly as advertised. a micro SD. with an adapter in case I ever want to use it in something else that uses a standard SD card. Its hard to get excited about a 4GB micro card. but I gave it 5 stars because everything about the purchase was excellent. It can be hard to find smallerunit SD and micro SD cards which some older devices need. I would go here again for memory for the next yard sale find i pick up that needs something hard to find in stores.,4,1,748
A1YIBJJC910PCQ,0,I use this compact CB while traveling and it work just fine. it is small and with the cigarette plug option. I dont have to worry about batteries.,4,1,146
A1YJHYTN0TQFQ4,11,When I first took out this sound system. I was decently impressed. I have had it for 2 months now and everything has worked perfectly. but as others have commented. I am thinking the cd drive may break because it has made an  odd squeaking noise when it rotates.... Otherwise. its a great system with  some good power but not the greatest clarity. The surround speakers are  rather low quality though. The rest is great. so go buy it. because 299  watts for this amount of money is too good to pass up!,4,1,502
A1YOB51ESOMU0Y,1011,Ive own this DVD Player .DVDA120. for over 2 years now.  It is easy to setup. operate and handles damaged DVDs as if they were flawless.  I rented a DVD which had a scratch and the A120 played it to profection after a slight moment of correction.  All Panasonic DVD players are known for this.  Dont trust me. take Consumer Reports word for this .see December 2001 Issue..  The picture quality is great too!,4,1,407
A1YOQKB992308L,12,This is a great set of reusable color codes cable ties for medium to large wires. They are a bit to big for smaller wires and you need to get at least a thumb full of wire to secure them properly.Picture sizing out Spagetti for two people big.. If you need it for a few small wires it wont work as well. These are also a bit hard to use inside a computer case because of the excess material. I see the appication for these more like using them to bind togther cords from a home entertainment system. or the mess of cords coming from the back of the computer.,4,1,558
A1YOR46K73484L,0,This e Reader is very limited with its availability of downloading books. it keeps telling me I have a lot of free space but when trying to download books its telling me I do not have enough space.I am not happy at all with this product,2,0,236
A1YQJDPJ6IN0FH,1,For shame Panasonic. Its quite obvious that there are serious flaws ridden in this DVD model. Just as with so many customers. my A120 went sour after barely a year. It refuses to play discs. even brand new ones. with the message u0026quotNo Playu0026quot. The ones that actually do play often have pixelation issues. Avoid.,1,0,323

A1YRMBRJPU2TTM,819,I got it from as a gift from my wife. it has helped me get well organized. Has all the functions a busy person needs to get arround and be effective in a busy world. I had a litle touble with it. but the people of 3com helped me a lot.,5,1,235

A1YT0LL42U91B6,45,I liked the case for the first few months. In combination with the stylus pen. it was a nice package. Six months later. Im not so pleased. It is not very good at protecting the palm from inadvertent poweron. It also pins down the up arrow. so alarms barely sound before theyre silenced. Worse than that. the rail that holds it to the case is attached with a strip of rubber that is ripping off. This is probably because the rail fit is pretty tight and the edges around where the rail inserts into the Palm are a little sharp. Taking the palm in and out of the case daily .which you need to do to sync or charge. has worn down the rubber. Im thinking of asking for a refund.,1,0,674
A1YTQ26Z4R7R8Y,89,I bought this system for myself last christmas. about 12 months ago.  The sound was great. I even played with the Karoke.  The alarm worked fine.  I play mostly CDs and the 3 cd changer worked fine. I tried the  tape player  and thats good also.  However. the CD player just gave up the ghost. Dont  know why. It tries to start but fails. I know they only warranty the units  for one years but I think they should last longer than that.,3,0,436
A1YV5G4GL5N6XV,1820,Ive been using this tape with my labelmaker for years and have been very happy with it. I went to Staples and ofcourse they were out of the black on clear so I went home and ordered on Amazon. I should have done that the first time!,5,1,232
A1YV5WLHI41HM5,22,These headphones are excellent quality for the money. I have purchased 5060 dollar headphones and they do not compare with the Jensen headphones. I have taken these headphones everwhere. They have even held up on 3040  School Sports trips. That takes a lot. The bass and excellent quality. I  would recommend this product for anybody that uses a discman alot. and they  handle on your hears perfect.,4,1,399
A1YV8SHMO8B0IP,0,In honor of my fallen case. I feel compelled to write this review. Several reviewers claimed the case would not protect their Palm...they were wrong. Mine found itself under the front tire of my car. and my Palm V survived without a scratch. The case took the brunt of the punishment  its history  but the Palm came out of the experience only emotionally scarred. Obviously. Ive ordered a new one. A great product.,5,1,414

A1YZ48QZYBV1BL,0,Ive used this case for about a year and am about to try a leather based one. For this case.The pluses are.  Protects the case well. Relatively slimThe minuses are. The case often depresses the contrast button. Case wears a hole in the back pocket of my pantsI got this case after first breaking a screen in my original palm when it fell out of my shirt pocket.  It has done a good job of protecting the device.  It has been a pain when the contract button is pushed because several times the contrast has gone to all black .good luck trying to tap on the contrast bar to bring it back again..  The other problem is that since it is a hard case. it wears holes in the pockets of my pants.  My jeans have holes where the corners of the case rub. Im going to try leather as a compromise.  Hopefully it will protect the unit. but not ruin pants!,4,1,841
A1YZEEDWCHXZUU,22,I ordered this cable from Sewell Direct. I received the cable in generic form. It was not packaged by Belkin. It did not say Belkin on the cable itself. It came in a plain plastic bag. My cable at home has Belkin imprinted on it. enclosed in Belkin packaging. I returned it to Sewell. They promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs. They should specify this generic or bulk packaging. so that I do not waste my time ordering from them.,2,0,465
A1YZO3HLP5ZYY6,0,I did a lot of research when I was looking for a new pair of speakers. I noticed that most of KLHs products were very low in price compared to the others and i wondered if they were any good. I bought these Model 18  Speakers. and they were definately worth the money. We also have a pair of  Bose speakers in the house that cost over 3 times the price. and they dont  sound nearly as good. They have alot of bass. and very good treble to them.  I would definately reccomend them to anyone.,5,1,490
A1YZQXKU5JNWED,4144,I was very pleased with the player for the two weeks it actually worked.  Then the power supply problem set in.  A slow decline.

A1YZV4SNECPYVO,2033,I bought this for my nikon coolpix 700 camera instead of the nikon version. which costed significantly more. If they do supply 1450mah. then they are near the top of the scale as far as AA nimh batteries.  They stick a little bit in the nikon due to their size. but nothing serious.  The four of them charge in about three hours.,5,1,329
A1Z1OKIV1MPL1R,1717,The Sony Mavica FD73 is lots of fun and easy to use.  The convenience of being able to use 3 12u0026quot discs as your storage media is worth a lot.  The zoom and macro capability is excellent.  Having said that. the picture quality is acceptable for snapshots. email. and auction sites. but is a far cry from photo quality.  The images get very grainy in low light. and are quite pixelated if enlarged at all.  Reflections and very bright spots are not handled well...light to dark transitions are coarse.  Youll be able to get decent prints up to about 5X7. but beyond that things start to get a bit fuzzy.  Ive had great fun with this camera and enjoy using it. but Im currently shopping for an FD88 to improve the image quality.,4,1,732

A1Z7A9YJCD2ZBR,1,This GE Superradio is a great radio for anyone to own. but especially if you live in a vicinity where you do not have a local radio station and the nearest station is 50 or more miles awaylike me.  This radio brings in  the stations from 50 miles as clear as if they were across the street from  me.  No static or other radio stations trying to come in like with my old  radio.  I truly recommend the GE Superradio for everyone.,5,1,428
A1Z8G756V2IW6N,33,I was given a Nook touch screen for Christmas and while excited. I really didnt want to convert to an e reader.  I love the feel and smell of a book.  Plus. there is something about seeing the progress. and holing it in your hands that I just love.  My husband has the original nook. and I tried out a book on it.  It was ok. but it was big. and clunky and heavy.  So. the new nook has that going for it.  I  downloaded a book right away and fell in love with it.  Its easy to buy books on it. share them. and my husband and I could  read the same book at the same time and it didnt mess with where each other were at in the book.  I love that I can tap the page and it turns. but thats also why I gave it four stars because my kids will tap the screen or it will get touched as I put it down. then when I pick it back up its on a different page.  I do love some features about it that are much improved over the old nook.  Its so much easier to look up the meaning of a word. you can have a wish list for books you want to buy. which you cant do on the old one.  I also love that you can pick your font and size of the font.  Any book you buy can become a large print...for those that need it.  While I still pick  up a regular book. my nook is enjoyable. and easy to take along. doesnt rip or get torn up.  I love it and would suggest it for anyone looking at purchasing an e reader.,4,1,1385

A1ZBFCYCUFXOIZ,24,I was very impressed with this product. and the accompanying car kit was very welcome. There should be no qualms about the merit of this product other than three factors which I found quite significant. namely.An EL  backlight for the LCD display is absent. The Dynamic Bass Boost would seem  to be lacking. The volume cannot be taken to extremely high levels.Other  than the above. the programming modes and the other features are well  structured and physically laid out. On the whole. I would call this a very  good valueformoney item.,3,0,538
A1ZBG4HKXZTVBF,7377,Works great to connect my Canon 60d or t5i camera to an HD TV. I directly connected it to two of my TVs and it works perfectly. When I connected it to a 3 port HDMI switch. it did not work. The price is great.,3,0,209
A1ZC4MJCJ8U7NM,0,For the price. you will not find a tablet better than the Nook Color.  The Nook Color runs on a striped down Android platform. which for most people will be all you need.  You have access to the full web with flash. email and apps like Pandora and Angry Birds.  Of course its main purpose is for reading.  The backlit display is very crisp and easy to read.  Because its backlit. it is very good for reading in the dark and surprisingly there is no issue reading in the sun as long as the brightness is turned up all the way.  I often sit on my back patio. wearing sunglasses and reading with no issue.  Battery life has been decent. but not great.  Typically I have to charge it every couple days after about an hour of reading and some web surfing every day.If you are up to the task you can even run full fledged Android Gingerbread or Honeycomb from a microSD card for full access to the Android software and Market without changing any of the stock software on the devise.  So for USD250 you can get a tablet that does as much as other USD500 tablets do.Overall I have been very happy with the purchase and would suggest it to you as well.,4,1,1144
A1ZCI6WR583X16,11,I bought a pair of these speakers at Home Depot and the transmitter was problematic.  It would turn on when first plugged in. then die about a minute later.

A1ZDN1UGDRUQ6Y,0,I entered the world of digital photography with a Fuji DS7.  Cheap. it provided a 640x480 introduction to the fun you can have with a computer camera.  I love the immediate feedback you get when you download the  pictures to your computer and see them pop up!  I shoot many. many more  pictures now that I have a digital camera.If my old Fuji was a nifty PT  Boat. then my Nikon Coolpix 950 is an aircraft carrier.  The high 1600x1200  resolution mode is stunning to view on my PC.  I find myself wondering if  my HP color printer is now the weak link in producing the best quality  shots.I find I dont use the middle 1024x768 resolution at all.  I  either go 640x480 for pictures to email my friends. or 1600x1200 for ones  to keep and print.I havent discarded my film camera yet. but Im taking  far fewer film pictures.  This camera is amazing techology.  Even with  better CCD sensors in the future. I dont see this camera being dated soon.  Its highres picture quality is amazing.  The controls can be a bit  confusing at first. but you can do just about anything with this camera  that you can with a film 35mm.,5,1,1116
A1ZDN7MJ2WI2XT,1416,I purchased a sony DVD player .DVP. one year and two months ago. This week it just stopped playing .would not recognize the disk. After doing the standard cleaning. air blowing.powerdowns and etc.. recommended by Sony. It still would not work. I payed USD129 for this player and Sony wants USD132 plus postage to fix it after one year and two months. Go to their service web site and put in the information pertaining to the DVD unit you are looking at. Then tell them you have owned it for one year and one day and see what repair is. Last Sony product I purchase. Buyer beware.,1,0,579
A1ZDP5PMM6RTSO,0,I couldnt use this drive with ACERs Aspire One eRecovery utility but have determined it is ACERs software problem. not a problem with the drive itself.  But what I learned in trying to get help from cBear was that .1. they can barely write English. .2. their first strategy is to send you all of the prewritten scripts that have nothing to do with your problem and. .3. if you persist. they will express doubt that there is a problem but will .grudgingly. agree to let you return the product.  I didnt need to do that because the drive works with software other that ACERs eRecovery but note that returns subtract 15% of the purchase price plus you pay for shipping.

A1ZECF8MFUFSV,11,I had recently purchased a serial to USB adapter from another company. which failed miserably. After returning it to the store and losing 7 bucks for u0026quotrepackagingu0026quot. I decided to get the Palm one. which I am glad that I did. My first adapter btw. cost almost double that I got here at Amazon. Installation and set up were a snap. I would however make the disclaimer DELETE THE PALM SOFTWARE THAT CAME ON YOUR MAC. there were a couple of glitches that I encountered until I did this. I wiped out all the files from the preinstalled software and ran what came with the adapter. Problem Solved! I guess there was application conflict when the two were set up at the same time. I am not sorry for having made the purchase.,4,1,733

A1ZHLYH9TSEWZH,0,I honestly love my nook! I have a kindle as well but I feel that the nook color is such a better investment. IT is so thin and small and the best part is you can take it anywhere! AND you can have multiple books on it! It is really great and you can download the FREE EBOOKS READER app for thousands of free books!,4,1,314
A1ZHQPAAP8HIAE,0,I purchased my Nook color eReader two years ago u0026 Im an avid reader. Ive never had any problems with it u0026 I just gave it to my mother because Im upgrading to a tablet thats more internet friendly. The eReader is for reading  period.,4,1,240
A1ZHR7KHGXUEVE,0,I bought this product because I workout and I wanted music to listen too. but when I have the radio on all I hear is static. I feel that I wasted my money on something that was going to be useful to me.Thank You,1,0,211
A1ZIIS7YI4AODB,11,I wouldnt say that this is the best overall radio that Ive ever owned. but it is certainly the best SHOWER radio Ive ever had.  It sounds very nice. has plenty of volume. and doesnt seem to mind a little moisture and steam.  I like the features. such as the push buttons .rather than switches or slides..  Ive only given it 4 out of 5 stars because every once in a while it sort of cuts out for about 2 seconds. which can be annoying when Im listening to something important .news. weather.. or it crackles and I have to turn it a bit to get good reception once again.  But it is much much better than any other radio in its class. and I do recommend it highly.,4,1,661
A1ZIJXLBUI564F,0,When hooked to my mac it mounts up right away. The only glitch is that it sits there clicking. as if the head were seeking or the drive motor pulsing. when empty. Not a big deal. If youre getting one of these its probably just to rescue some data or. as in my case. communicate with an antique piece of computer equipment. so you arent going to leave it plugged in anyway. At this price I cant complain. The packaging was excellent. too.,3,0,437
A1ZIUM70CBKT6G,0,Ive own a camera just like this one .modelcc4362. For 34 years now and its great except for recording around or in  loud noices.

A1ZJE36Q6F6Y6V,0,I bought this player about a month ago. I have been impressed by the quality. I use it to listen to music while running and it is perfectly suited to the task. Yesterday I put it in the washer with clothing by  accident. It went through the entire wash and I thought I would have to buy  a new one. Well I didnt. It still works perfectly. I am truly impressed  with the quality of the Diamond Rio.,5,1,397
A1ZJF8YB4LZ356,24,The customer support people at Barnes u0026 Noble site are clueless. They are useless for providing help. If you buy tablet. you are on your own. In the store it is the same.,1,0,174
A1ZJR69DNRNIVR,713,The only parts that were not optimal. Mine came with a small deep scratch on the optical side of the disc didnt affect discs performance thus far. The voice instructions recorded to the disc were slightly confusing in the wording.,4,1,230
A1ZJW2PAANWLVI,0,I bought this chargingsync cable for my HTC Incredible phone.  It works well and I have had no sync problems while using it. As indicated by this seller. the USB connectors. as well as the actual cable are of high quality .better than OEM.. however the cable length is quite short.  Not much longer than 2 feet long.  If you are using it for charging only. its fine as long as you are close to an outlet. If you need it longer you will have to invest in getting a USB extension.,3,0,478
A1ZLP2VEK68YSC,0,When i first saw it i thought what have i bought? Then as i started to use it i started to realize how cool it was. I am just a newcomer to MP3s but i know a fair amount so when i saw an easier way to control my amazing rio  300 i went straight for it.  It is so easy to use and simple that you  wonder why you did not buy it in the first place. It is easy to understand  how to use it. it is clear and quick. What else can you ask for?  Well i  think if you work out a lot and wish for an easier way to choose your  favourite songs then you SHOULD buy the Rio headphone remote.,4,1,578
A1ZM1M2598O5I3,55,It does not do the job. its under 10 seconds of tape it starts and finishes even sooner.does not clean at all. Im going with a wet system.Years ago it used to be good not any more.,1,0,180

A1ZN0X9PWO8ATF,1,I think the Rio Diamond sounds real good and stuff and it looks pretty sweet man. The only thing it needs is to be a bit tuffer so you can do welding and stuff when you listing to it yknow.  Overall is pretty not bad  apart from being a wussy piece of equipment. not like my truck dude.,3,0,286
A1ZN39Y9Z343B3,228,This radio works but the range is just awful. I have a jeep with a massive antennae and I have to be right next to my buddy who bought this to get any sort of reading from this cb. It works just not very well.,2,0,209

A1ZNDM3C5ZDC8F,0,I have owned three of these radios.  They once performed well. especially distant AM reception.  The present version of this radio hardly performs any better than your average USD10 radio.  At times. the Am reception from distant cities can be good.  But try to listen to a baseball game from a station only 35 miles away. and you have to correct the drift about every two minutes.  My wife saw my frustration one night. turned on the cheap table top radio and sure enough it held the station and had a better sound.,2,0,516
A1ZNLNA7BEZJCP,0,This is a nice cable with dual ears to protect the tabs from breaking. They work like they should which is good. They are a little pricey for what they are. Also note that the color is not the same as in the picture. These are light gray in color not Dark Gray.,3,0,261
A1ZPEZMQBCTZQN,11,Very sturdy. The arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose.  However. the mount works great. just make sure you get that stud just right. I was impressed with the quality and happy with the price.,4,1,209

A1ZSPRR520SIFF,0,Ive been a part of the Barnes and Noble Nook family since the very first Nook was released. I started out with the Nook WiFi. Within a year and a half. I upgraded to the NookColor. The Nook Color was a new reading experience. And honestly. after the Nook Tablet came out. I was a little disappointed. It wasnt the best experience.Now I am on the Nook HD. This tablet is the best for the money I spent. Barnes and Noble has made a mistake in its marketing. though. They never showcased the Bluetooth connectivity! That is the best fataure. and I had no idea that the 7inch Tablet had it. Imagine my surprise when I was able to connect my bluetooth keyboard to the device with ease!Ive been able to chat with my friends using great Apps. and update Evernote anywhere I go easily. and quickly. This is the best product Barnes and Noble has come out with. Its an amazing little tablet for the money. Thank you. Barnes and Noble. for making such a quality product.,5,1,959

A1ZW3D1PHMGZ9H,0,I own 3 of these as good general radios. It has a fault that shows up if you try to use it for earphone listening. There is a constant lowlevel hum that is obvious when you turn the volume down.,3,0,194
A1ZXWHGSKIR9LW,710,This is a great product. I have had mine for about 2 years now and it is still as precise and smooth as ever. It is easy to clean and maintain and is great for graphic design.The only thing I have to mention is that this mouse is for righthanded users only. I do not believe that Logitech has manufactured a lefty version of this great mouse. Too bad.,5,1,351
A1ZYDU26TKRNAW,22,I bought two of these for my kids and they are awful. The picture quality is so low that only about 10% of the photos are worth keeping. And being for my young children. my standards are very low. I bought them almost as a toy. and STILL Im severely disappointed. DO NOT BUY.,1,0,275
A1ZZ52VGCCQI3N,55,Beware. The Amazon.com documentations is wrong as it states that this is a print server and has an integrated network hub.

A1ZZRHIVXDT2R5,0,Bought an HD and HD+ directly from Bu0026N during the BF Weekend sale and promptly rooted Cyanogenmod 10.2 .Android 4.3. on them. they run fast and smooth. An android tablet with this resolution at this price is a good deal. I prefer the HD over the HD+. just feels better in my hand. We ended up buying a Nook HD for each one of our kids for Christmas.There are a couple of things that would make this a five star tablet. one would be the addition of camera but we have cell phones for that so not that big a bummer. and the other being the proprietary USB port. Still a great deal and has a MicroSD slot for more memory.,4,1,622
A2009MTFH7DOZW,0,absolutly love the nook HD  I bought one at wal mart as a gift and was so impressed with it that I had to order another one for myself........ great job Barnes u0026 Noble!,5,0,172
A203DX6JIS8B4L,0,Cover fits well...nice grip..small buttonholes are a little tight to operate buttons. but overall a very nice protector.,4,1,120
A203MDQBABOQNS,0,My wife originally purchased this Nook not only for reading ebooks but also to access her web business while away. Well for the reading part. the Nook worked great as long as you were getting books from Bu0026N. Trying to get ebooks from Amazon was not an option. The available apps from the Nook store were very limited compared to Amazon and Google Play store as well. And using this Nook for web browsing or purchasing music was a joke. I had a Kindle and swapped with my Wife as she wanted all the Amazon access and I like to tinker.I purchased a Android For Nook .AFN. card and went through the rooting process which was easy for people who can read direction and program clocks on VCRs. This improved the Nook from a glorified ebook reader to a full fledged Android Tablet. The version of Android .CyanogenMod. used is Gingerbread which is very stable. Not cutting edge but worlds better than the Bu0026N operating system. I was able to add both Nook and Amazon Kindle apps for reading as well as opening a world of apps from Google Play. The tablet is mostly used for games and movies for the kids. which both work quite well with the Nook now. Infact I would rank the Nook with the AFN modification as a better overall tablet then the Kindle since it provides for addition storage .up to 32gb. and is very easy to root. My biggest complaint left .same as the Kindle. is a lack of camera. gps. and bluetooth.In stock form. this tablet is a 2 star product because of the crapware Nook OS. But when rooted with Android. this is a solid all around tablet worthy of a 4 star rating.,4,1,1585
A2056W6XCU5C5X,11,Bought this for my daughter.  She is having difficulty with the pass word. and is finding that its functionality is very limited.,2,0,129
A205TD9S98NKH7,0,From the overly complicated setup process .you have to tune the base station and the headset to the same channel. to the constant adjustments .there is a bizarre system for maintaining a signal that requires changing volume levels on both the base and the headsets. to the intermittent static. these were a real disappointment.On the other hand. when they actually worked they did sound pretty darn good.,2,0,404
A205WXC39HW3YV,0,Apparently when it works this is a great thing to have! I got a bad unit and did everything to get it to work properly. but the unit simply did not work and froze all the time. Called Palm. they were very eager to replace  it with a refurbished unit. which is no bad but not what I expected or paid  for. I bought this for convinience. but has only been a problem and a waste  of my time. I am not giving up yet though. I have asked Amazon to replace  the unit. Will see what happens!,1,0,484
A2063NNYWR4B7J,1702,Great Value with a lot of included hardware. Some of the hardware included was of low quality. The two lag bolts .all that could fit onto the stud.. held up my Sony Vaio computers 28lbs. just fine. I wouldnt put too much more weight on there and still expect full range of motion.Installation was straightforward.,4,1,313
A2063VY8BB2L96,0,all these cords dont work with a nike sportwatch. the nike sportwatch can be plugged into a computer USB port.,1,0,110
A206T4VZQWZH2O,0,The RCA RCU800 Universal remote control was a very big disappointment. It did not work with my Philips Satellite Receiver even through my model is listed as supported and has a code number. My Sanyo DVD player was not supported at all. The only thing which did work was my GE television which was one of the defaults. Technical support for this product was a joke and it was impossible to reach a live technician. Frankly the printed user manual was easier and faster to use then telephone support. It is also impossible to make a presale determination as to which products are supported. not that you can believe the manual. Save the time and aggravation and do not purchase this product. I wish I could recommend an affordable alternative but I have not found one.Mike,1,0,770
A206Z3Z524NY4O,33,I now have the Brother Labeler and have no problem with it.I also feel that the tape last forever. I guess it all depends on how muchyou use it.I label many things and Im on my second tape roll and I purchased the machine about six months ago. .Great device.,4,1,258
A209J4NK7GR9S3,22,I needed to get this external USB dvdcd device. for a laptop I have that doesnt have a cddvd drive in it. I was very pleased when this arrived. and it didnt need any set up. All I had to do was hook it to the laptop. and it worked very smoothly and easily. This is a solidly good product. and for a good price. and so far it is working very well. However I felt that it is a bit sensitive to the touch when it is working. so the user has to be a little careful with it.,4,1,469
A209ZISSN2NZ7,0,Have had the Color Nook for Two Weeks. I have been nothing but Impressed. by the Quality and feel of the Table. The Color is Unreal. and compared to the Black and White Ereaders. Why Bother. its Like Having HD in your Palm for the Internet. Youtube Videos etc. Its has exceeded my Expectations. Glad I avoided the Kindle due to the black u0026 whiteColor Factor. and 6.000 books. Good Luck trying to fill this up.,5,1,413
A20AAU9AUQ2ATE,44,The pair of 16x50 Bushnell Powerview binoculars I received were defective from the start. with serious double vision and unequal focus between eyes .despite diopter adjustment.. so I cant comment on their optic quality.  I did test each barrel separately and thought the 16x50 view was big. bright and clear. . .Although it seemed neither side focused real shapely. that may have been from the defect.s. my pair came with.Currently .32014. the listing for these 16x50 PorroPrism binoculars says Roof Prism for some reason ??I tested my 16x50s on a sunny day.  Tho theyre high power .16. for the objective lens diameter .50.. the exit pupil size gave me no trouble. . .It may have been in double vision but it was easy to get the full view. at least on a bright day.There are complaints in the reviews about the Lever focus mechanism. versus a focus wheel.  The little that I used the binoculars. I didnt have a problem with the lever focus.  In fact. focusing by rocking the lever with a finger on each side was kind of nice.  The lever mechanism seems like a promising idea but apparently whether Bushnell executed it effectively is in question.  And I suppose its possible the lever mechanism had something to do with the unequal focus between barrels and apparent softfocus but given my pairs other huge problems. it was impossible to tell.The reviews complaining of the toowide interpupillary adjustment are SPOTON.  Im male of average height.  My eyes arent particularly close together but my binoculars at their narrowest interpupillary distance were barely narrow enough for me.  Ive never before had that trouble with binoculars.  These binoculars would be useless for lots and lots of people.Otherwise the binoculars seemed solid and durable.My main problem wasnt with the binoculars but with Amazon Warehouse Deals. where I bought them.  Theres no reason binoculars this defective should have been relisted and sold to me...Its plain bad business and bad customer service. Anyone considering buying binoculars from Warehouse Deals should do it with eyes wide open for lemons.  Luckily theyre pretty easy about returns and letting you try again. A keeper arrives eventually.Of course Ill return them.  Im ambivalent about trying another pair of 16x50 Powerviews.  The complaints about the focus lever and interpupillary adjustment had me on the fence to begin with.  Then I get this pair thats so miserably outofwhack. . .It might be a fluke or it might be the Powerview design ??If youre looking at Powerviews. consider Bushnell H2O I have a pair of 8x42 H2Os.  For about the same price the H2Os are waterproof u0026 more solid and come with a wheel focus and better twistup. rather than foldup. eyecups.  However. H2Os dont have the attractive selection of high powers and big objectives.,3,0,2799
A20AOQWXYDFAU7,0,.Update 81908. its over a year since I wrote the original review  radio looks almost new. cleans easily. works great. and still doesnt require frequent battery changes  still love it!.10. Youve lost faith that there is such a thing as a good shower radio9. It would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good rock while gettin clean8. It would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good NPR Morning Edition while getting clean7. It would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some the morning TV news while gettin clean6. All of the above also applies to shaving or putting on makeup5. Tend to dawdle?  It has a timer.  Get out the door before the rest of the nuts get on the road4. It doesnt mind getting wet along with you3. Batteries have lasted me a month so far. Though I dont care. The sound is so good for a shower radio Id happily replace them weekly2. Oh. the weather channel  very nice. although a bit repetitiveAnd the top reason you should buy this radio is.1. Ahhh. nine are enough. Just buy the thing.,5,1,1097

A20IY0H76J8ICM,0,I am awarding this mount 4 stars.I used the Video Secure mount for my 23 inch TV which weighed only 13lb. The hardware supplied was excellent for mounting it on a wood wall stud. The arm of the mount detaches so that it is easy to mount the wall plate to the stud. The mount was more than adequate for my light weight TV. It can be adjusted to swivel and tilt. The only negative was that while the plate mounted to the back of the TV with the screws provided. the lower left corner interfered with the power plug. Video Secure can provide a mount with a smaller plate. Rather than return my mount for the smaller plate. I chose to use a hacksaw and removed an approximately one by two inch corner in order to permit the plug to enter the TV. So with that caution in mind. I would recommend this product very highly. If I had ordered the smaller plate originally I would have rated it 5 Stars. I was able to do the job without any help. With a heavier TV. an extra pair of hands would be useful.,4,1,994
A20K1N5EXV0KHN,45,Purchased the TEAC AD500 cassetteCD player for our church and we use it frequently for background accompanyment and other support music. It has performed very well for our needs. Having one machine that plays both media is a definite advantage where room is a factor.,5,1,267

A20LW3PRHM03N4,44,As far as sound goes. this system is really nice. But before you buy it on the net go to a real store and play around with it. It takes an enormous amount of time to eject a cd from this box. switching cds is really slow.  and you have to stop the music if you want to insert another cd.  These  problems might sound minor. but they are not unless you dont mind taking a  nap while you try to insert a cd. Also. there is about 15 seconds delay  between every song when the system is in the random mode with more than 1  cd.  I just bought this  system and Im so annoyed by this lightning speed  cd changing mechanism. Im going to ship it back tomorrow.,1,0,652
A20M3X8G7P8E77,1216,I have had a GPS 12 since about 1996 and used it extensively without any problems. It is a great. solid. reliable unit. I have mountain biked. hiked. drove. geocached and backpacked with it.I heartily recommend it to anyone needing a good basic GPS.My only complaint about it is the battery compartment isnt waterproof. This has never been a problem for me. even in the rain. but it seems it would have been simple to make it so it could handle accidental submersion better.Now I am handing it down as I have recently received a Foretrex 101 for Christmas and love it even more. and it cost even less.,4,1,601

A20NW8UIJR8CB8,0,Surprise. a good product! Not for distance with antenna provided.  The best part is it doesnt require installation and doesnt take up room.  Using a Wilson 1000 magnetic mount antenna. distance and audio is tremendously increased. Portability from one vehicle to another is simple.  Have not purchased rechargable batteries as alkaline seem to last a long time. Weather channels work great! I would recommend this either as an emergency. spare or portable unit. Midland surely is conservative on output. Apppears to put out 2  3 watts. not 4 as stated.,3,0,552
A20OLSKIOYON64,23,This product is an absolute disaster. It has jammed in no less than four different VCRs. It also appears to have severely damaged the heads in one of my machines. The static is now  ten times worse than  before I used this head cleaner. I have now resorted to using my old head cleaner even though it has already passed its recommended number of 100 uses. I should have heeded all of the other awful reports on this product  which I read and not purchased it. This head cleaner  needs to be withdrawn from the market Immediately.,1,0,529
A20ORTSQTEQX0Y,0,I still use videotapes for easy. uncomplicated recording of things I dont plan on keeping indefinitely.  Ive used two tapes from the pack I bought and they are just fine.  No problems so far.  Am rating 4 rather than 5 only because I havent been using them long. and I havent done much rerecording. which is something else I do.  I may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them!,4,1,386
A20OU9GXJTQ6B0,0,I guess its okay. The VCR I used it on had to be professionally cleaned. If your unit isnt that bad and you keep up with cleaning it. it should work well.,4,1,154

A20PWYIE1K48EX,46,I just ordered a Palm III online a few weeks ago. and so far I like it.  Its easy to use. I entered information in the address and date book field immediately and have been expanding to the memo pad and to do list.  A few things I dont like. the alarm isnt much of an alarm.  It makes a very faint noise once at the time you set it for and if you dont hear it then youre just kinda out of luck. but as soon as you turn your palm on again. that note shows up with the alarm time and date and description.  Also. I got a cord with mine. not a cradle. and it wont connect to my computer .I guess the connecting cable is too old for my 2004 laptop?. and I cant find an adapter. so I havent been able to connect it to the computer or download anything. which sucks for me. but I dont know if thats a common problem or not.  I also got a CD with it which I installed. but without a connection it doesnt help much. but atleast the Palm is userfriendly enough that I could figure out the basics without the CD.  For the price theyre going now. anywhere from USD20 used. I definitely think its a good deal for your money. good means of organization for someone with a busy schedule who needs addresses and dates at their fingertips.  I have it in a case and it fits in my purse fine. not too big or bulky.,4,1,1296

A20R85ANI431BO,35,I bought an OEM version of this mouse from another vendor for next to nothing.  The only thing different about it is that it didnt come with the normal packaging or the logitech logo on the top of the mouse.Overall the mouse is okay.  Installation is simple and the mouse itself works well for most things.  I have two complaints about it though.  The first is that it doesnt fit very well in my hand compared to some of the other mice in the marketplace.  The second is that the mouse creaks and groans as you move it.The bottom line when picking a mouse is to find one that you find comfortable to your hand and then buy that one.  If I had to do it over again. I would have still gone with logitech. but just a different model.,3,0,730
A20R85ANI431BO,0,This is a magnificent CD player.  It goes anywhere and does just about anything.  It positively will not skip.  Battery life does seem a bit short however but disabling the antiskip functions of the cd player do help this.  The headphones could also be a bit better. but the player itself is every bit as good as a Sony or any other name brand.,4,1,344
A20TBOG8IBHU44,0,The drive installed and perfomed OK for me.  I was also one of the u0026quotluckyu0026quot ones who received a faster drive than what I ordered .supposedly. 1 in every 5 or so was randomly chosen to receive a faster  drive..  Take that for what it is worth.  BUT. as for their rebate program.  IT SUCKED!  After about 23 months. I emailed Digital Research 4 times.  and called twice. before FINALLY receiving a phone call from their customer  service department.  I then received the rebate after a total of about 4  months.  Overall. I would neither buy nor recommend buying from Digital  Research.,2,0,599
A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,22,I purchased these headphones before traveling to Europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great.  The sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice.  The battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains.  I used it on both flights with great relaxation and I also used it on the Chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction.The weight. length of cord. and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable.  They are made of plastic and feel very fragile.  I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch.  But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.In other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design.  After only about a month. one of the wires split and I lost the right headphone completely.  And forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing.I am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again.  If not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the price.,2,0,1333
A20UHOVAQX4DTY,33,This radio gets great reception and is perfect for the bath. kitchen. or patio.  Mine stopped working after a few months. but Sony replaced it.  The replacement stopped working after about 1 12 years because the touchpad began to get brittle and cracked.  Water got in and now the controls dont work.  Oh well.  I did use it in my steam shower. which is probably not the standard use for it. Also. Im buying another one.  Theres really nothing that compares.  Its compact. has good sound. and is reasonably waterproof.,4,1,518
A20UIG8MWYLGL6,11,I like the additional straps to hold the kindle in the leather jacket.  The only drawback is it is a little bit in the way of the slider offon switch.  I also like the place for a notebook.  I use my notebook for fast reference of how to do certain things rather than having to look them up until I learn them.,4,1,310
A20UNGO56AP7ZQ,0,You did great. my Grandfather is 91 years old and he loves to record Sunday morning service. Hes been telling the family that he needed more tapes and radioshack had two for USD20! So thank you Amazon!,5,1,201
A20UU20K7M9ZPF,11,I bought this Nook Simple Touch on Amazon.com. but when I received it. the WiFi would not connect. I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town. Barnes u0026 Noble Customer Service was NO HELP. telling me that. since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from Bu0026N. they could not help me. and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller. I did return it. thinking it was damaged somehow. and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument .kudos to him and Amazon!..Later. I bought one from Bu0026N. and it had the same problem. Again. Bu0026N Customer Service was NO HELP. but did send a replacement. The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi. Now. Im arguing with Bu0026N for a full refund.Most of the reviews are glowing. But what they dont say is that Bu0026N has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch. Even the Bu0026N Forum has many references to the problem.Im not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches. and maybe you will not have the same problem. Just beware.CAVEAT EMPTOR!,1,0,1121
A20V4HUZS9JD78,1516,I couldnt wait to get this radio for my wife. Every night she listens to far away AM stations that fade away and then come back only to fade away again. This RCA superadio does not perform any better than our cheap radios. The AM stations fade in and out the same way. The only good thing about it is the speaker. USD59.00 plus USD19.00 shipping. Im not going to return it and pay another USD19.00 to send it back. Win some. lose some. I lost this one.,1,0,452

A20XNKM7ZL6E71,0,I got this to transfer files from my Nikon 5400.  It works well and the fit and finish is very good.  I am using a Dell latitude D610 laptop with XP on it.  No complaints with this especially for the price.Pros.If you just put the adapter in the PC slot the computer does not recognize it.  I like this bc if I want to take it out then I dont have to deal with disconnecting it in XP. .Once you add the CF card XP recognizes it..The CF card together with the adapter. while inserted in the computer are flush with the side computer.  This prevents me from being a klutz when I leave it in the computer and breaking it off.Cons. The CF when inserted is flush with the side of the computer.  I like this .see above.. but it means that you have to eject the whole adapter to get the CF card out.,5,1,792
A20YV9GYH2SBMS,44,I purchased this cable to charge my phone. When it arrived. I plugged it in to find it does not charge the phone. but connects to the internet. I emailed the vender and the reply was that I should contact the manufacturer. Yeah Thanks. So much for customer support.,1,0,265
A20Z4CE06K4UU3,0,I head up a disaster preparedness CB radio group in my community. which supports local first responders. This is the radio that we have settled on. All new members buy the Midland 75822. It offers amazing range and clarity. I do recommend that you purchase the Cobra HATA long range antenna. if you are thinking of using this as a handheld. It will double your range of the rubber duckie that it comes with. We have achieved 4+ mile range as a handheld. Works even better when coupled with a good mobile antenna. Weve even connected it to 100 of coax. into a base ground plane atop an 8story building. There was no loss in signal or modulation. You will love the flexibility of this stateoftheart CB. This isnt your grandpas radio!,5,1,731
A210UZTIFQ6FLD,22,Great radio. I bought with to be portable. Has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries. Also can plug in an antenna if you want. Range is short with the stubby. but that is to be expected. Love that is has the scan feature and weather. For the price its hard to beat.,4,1,283
A212CU7ZC7H14B,0,I am very happy with this seller with the exception that neither the owners manual nor the compu link3 sync cord were included. if I hadnt had a previous CD component. I would have had a hard time finding this cord that is needed to sync the CD component to the receiver. The remote had some corrosion from the batteries that were left in. but I was able to clean that out and get it working.  BUT the machine works immaculately and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I love it!,4,1,482

A213CCHCDLOH7K,0,I loved this ereader for a long time. It was just what I wanted. without all of the extra apps and everything else that distracts you from reading. I also owned a Nook Color .sold. but loved the Simple Touch and used it often because of the eink display. I could read for hours without hurting my eyes even in sunlight. something I couldnu00268217t do on the Color or on a computer. The battery life is still excellent 3 years later. it really will last 2 months without a charge. Plus. Bu0026N sold the cutest cases for it. I stopped using my Nook Simple Touch .trying to sell it. because I no longer purchase books from the Bu0026N store. Kindle books are often a little cheaper and the customer service is A LOT better! I emailed Bu0026N a few times and never received a reply within the promised 48 hours so I ended up calling. They will never refund a purchase after it has been downloaded. I purchased the wrong book and Bu0026N would not even give me store credit so that I could purchase the correct one. This was within 24 hours of making the purchase and I had never made the mistake before.,4,1,1101

A213KAW8OX4Q9T,0,I bought my Rio direct from Diamond on October 6th. of last year.  I took them until December 17 to send it out.  It included little documentation. quirky software. and the support at Diamond when I called in was horrible.  The headphones are little to be desired for. but hey.. you get what you pay  for.  .In this case. a lot of moola for little gadgets.  I suggest buying  the upgraded headphones and remote from them.  .For more moola.  .. better  get a job or save some money if you dont already!,4,1,501
A214IX8FLHGZKQ,0,I have some SLK series TalkAbout radios that are probably over 12 years old.  The original batteries finally just died of old age.  I had trouble finding the correct batteries. but finally found these.  It took 45 days for them to arrive and when they did. neither battery would charge. not withstanding which charger or radio I tried them in.  I suspect these batteries were probably as ancient as the ones I replaced.  I will be returning them shortly. assuming I have not waited to long to deal with this.,1,0,508

A215R2YBC4OGB7,513,After viewing the companies website and the amazon description. I was sure that this would fit into my new Macbook Pro 13 . However. after many trials to get it to fit. it wouldnt. It seems that the metal stoppers that come out towards the locking mechanism do not leave enough room for the lock to be set all the way in the locking slot on the mac. And with that occurring you can not turn the lock in either direction. You could try it on your laptop and send it back for a refund if it does not work. but try not to waste your time as it does not work with macs.,2,0,565
A21623VNZ5H1YE,12,I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition. and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things. get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books. and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it. but it was way too difficult. and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader. the nook can take notes but wouldnt be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up I didnt read the instruction manual. but I usually dont. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet. my barnes and noble account. and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet. but that has happened with every new device Ive purchased. so I think its my internets fault. not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read I generally read ridiculously thick books. so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up .and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad the iPad is fine to read from. and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue. but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand.. Initially I didnt realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back. so I was touching the screen each time the delay time is a bit longer that way. and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed. the experience got even better.The battery life seems great I charged it all the way up using my usbtooutlet power adapter that I have for my iphoneipad. and it worked great. I havent had to charge it again. and Ive been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldnt load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasnt enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb. which is a ton of books. but it wasnt enough room for the books Ive acquired through other sources like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution there is a slot for a microSD card. and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around plus they only cost about USD5. if that. I popped it in. turned the device off and on. and I was ready to go again. Not a dealkiller by any means. but something to consider if youre planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook I havent owned a kindle. only used it for a few minutes. but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this. price was important .and I got a great black friday deal on the nook.. and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format. since you can load books from other sources. Yes. its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people wont be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers. and hadnt thought much about it. but Ive enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen. and would probably get annoyed by the commercialsmake a point to put my nook in a case so I didnt have to see them.Durability I havent abused it by any stretch of the imagination yet but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didnt crackbreakshow any sort of damageIll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months,5,1,3788
A216WFBI15Q4T2,55,TV has been mounted about two weeks and still holding up.  Pretty easy to adjust the TV to different angles.  Overall installing the TV mount wasnt hard.  The only thing that gave us a little trouble was the TV had a little raised curve on the back.  Therefore when we tried to attach the bar that connects to the TV. the bars did not sit flush.  We had to cut those bars down to get a flush mount.  Not sure if that is a fault of the TV mount or the TV itself.  Note. I dont know how the mounting sizes are created. i.e. 300x300. but the mount did say it would fit my TV and we still had to cut those bars.  Not a big deal to me and the mount still works well but this is something you may want to factor into your buying decision.  For those green people. packaging was really good on this. not much wastedopen space.,4,1,819
A21794HF0Q7X4Z,1,This is the first MD recorder that I have gotten. and I love it.  VERY easy to use. and I though. very intuitive.  You do need extra cables to record from certin nondigital sources. but I had all those. and making the connections where very easy.  If you are new. and want to get a great recorder at a great price. I definatly recommend this one.,5,1,346
A2183499CPCTIA,33,Im on my second one  had my first one for a year before my sister swiped it and took it back to Alabama with her. I guess she must have liked it a lot too. After about a week without it I had to buy another.  I do not use it in the shower but I do keep it in the bathroom on top of the toilet tank.  Wow is it great.  One push on top and the radio is on. You dont even need to have your glasses on because the button is big.  Push another button and you set a timer for it to go off after 15 or 30 minutes so you dont have to remember to go back in and turn it off. Im listening to the morning news while I brush my teeth and dry my hair and put makeup on. and I can put it on a classical music station for a soak in the tub after work.  Its not too big. the controls are simple and intuitive. and it looks nice. The battery lasted in the first one for the whole year before my sister took it  its probably still running at her house on the same battery. I looked at a lot of radios before I found this one  I wanted waterproof. not too big. no cord  there just isnt anything close. Highly recommended if youd like a radio in the bathroom.,5,1,1139
A2184TI6WIAOA,33,I got these from a small shop in an airport and wasnt expecting too much to tell you the truth.  They are really loud. in fact i dont think i have had headphones go this loud from my laptop.  The sound is very tinny .no bass whatsoever..  For the price they work and they come with a carrying case so not so bad but i wouldnt recommend them for everyday use.,3,0,358
A218KBN0U36SJT,22,Its a nice speaker set. except for one huge problem. no separate volume control for the subwoofer.

A2198FZZMTJ38H,0,The RCA RC5220P DVDVideo Player is good for its price. I want to get that fact out of the way before going into the ups and downs of this nicely crafted yet slightly flawed piece of equipment. The good things. Dolby and DTS outputs which sound crisp and clear. picture quality that fits the DVD standard mold. and the ability to change subtitles and audio. while jumping to different places in the movie. all without having to revert to the original menu on the disc. The player also includes Divx ability. a dictionary for all those technical terms you wont find in a Webster. and easytouse setup menus that are easily selfexplanatory. The bad things. the speed going through menus is a bit sluggish. especially in newer. more comprehensive releases. and it has been known to shut itself off once in a while. But. if all youre looking for is a machine to play your movies on. as well as durability and features galore. then this is a DVD player that is sure to please its owner.,4,1,979
A21A8KG5ZU875C,89,I didnt have the same luck as the reviewer whose recorder survived the washing machine .and dryer.  mine is dead.However. I did find the thing very handy while I had it.  The sound quality is great. and it is small  enough to carry in a pocket.  The only complaint I would have is that since  there were only a few buttons on it. some of the features were very  nonintuitive .hold x button for two seconds then press y button until  yaddayadda appears. etc..  I didnt find it worth the storage space in my  evershrinking memory to remember all the programming features. so they  went unused.Overall. very good product.,4,1,618
A21AOHWYUQ3QEY,911,I finally decided to spend the extra USDUSD for the Palm V and give my old Palm III to my dad.  Afterall. I loved the styling. but more importantly wanted the slimmer size.Unfortunately. when you use the hard cover that comes with the Palm V and put it in your pocket. it causes the power button  to turn on and then the updown key constantly clicks.  Huh?So then I  went out and got the hard case .a rip off if you ask me.. causing the  Palm V to be just as thick as my Palm III.  That left me wondering why I  bothered spending all that extra money to get a Palm no smaller than the  one I already had.Dad. can I get my Palm III back?,3,0,636
A21APKSWB0MVLS,1301,I picked up a pair of these at a pawn shop for cheap. and I wasnt expecting much seeing how the New KLH isnt the OLD KLH... and I plugged these into my Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 Subwoofer and listed to them and they sounded pretty good. I had a problem when I plugged them into my Technics SA400 Receiver with Bass. these little speakers handled bass nicely but were so light they would go all over the place.I do recommend these speakers. they are good sounding. light. However the Highs can seem a little bright.,4,1,509

A21AXU8TWE8GMT,0,The talkabout 250 seems to have a clunky design. specifically with the placement of the u0026quotPush to Talku0026quot button.  This microphone plugs in and allows you the ease and flexibility of a real microphone.Ths microphone unit works both as a speaker and as a microphone.  The speaker  in this unit is superior to the internal speaker in the talkabout.This  unit allows you to put the radio in your pocket. or clip it on your belt  and still be able to hear and talk on the radio.  The microphone contains a  clip that you can clip to your collar or shirt pocket that keeps the  speaker close enough to your ear for you to hear anything. as well as close  to your mouth for talking.I strongly suggest that if you buy a TalkAbout  250 that you also buy this microphone.This microphone does not work with  the TalkAbout 280 which has different size microphoneheadphone jacks.,5,1,880
A21AXU8TWE8GMT,2222,The arrow keys take a little getting used to. but it is great on the wrists.When I first started using this keyboard it was on my computer at work.  For about the first 3 or 4 days. I had trouble with the arrow keys. and the 6 keys above the arrows .home. end. delete. page up. page down. and  insert..  The problem is that they are arranged different than any keyboard  that I have used before.  Once I was used to using this keyboard. I had a  difficult time using my keyboard at home.  Shortly thereafter I replaced my  home keyboard with this one.As far as key placement goes. the important  things to know are.1.  The placement of the backslash key.  I have seen  this in a couple different places on different keybards.  The Microsoft  Natural Keyboard Elite V2.0 has the backslash key above the enter key and  below the backspace key.  This allows for the larger backspace key.  I feel  that this is very important. since this is something that I have become  very used to.  Over the last 15 years. I have tried keyboards that have the  backslash key next the the backspace key. and I just seem to make mistakes  with that placement.  Microsoft has done this one correctly .in my humble  opinion..2. The keypad above the arrows .home. end. delete. page up.  page down. and insert. is arranged different that I have ever seen it done  before.  Usually this is a keypad that is 3 keys wide by 2 tall. Microsoft  has changed the layout to 3 tall by 2 wide.  This doesnt seem to perform  any differently than the old way. it is just different .not good or bad.  just different..  This will take a little getting used to. but it works  well once you have adapted.3.  The arrow keys.  Until this keyboard. I  have always seen the arrangement of 3 arrow keys across the bottom .left.  down. right.. with one centered above those 3 .up..  This does it  differently. there are 2 keys in the middle area .left and right. with a  key centered above .up.. and below .down..I seem to be able to type  faster using this keyboard than I have using other keyboards.I used the  original Microsoft natural keyboard. and it is elevated off the desk much  higher.  The older one had an option to raise the front of the keyboard.  but this one only has the option to rais the back.The lights for scroll  lock. num lock. and caps lock are located in the center of the keyboard. in  the break between the left and the right hand side of the home row.  This  is good because they are easier to notice than when the lights are in the  keys or next above the number lock.I use this keyboard on both windows  and unix. and it works great.I am not someone who has had problems  with my wrists. but I do notice that it is just more comfortable.If you  spend much time at they keyboard. I would recommend this keyboard.,5,1,2796
A21AXU8TWE8GMT,1617,A good case. but it could use some improvements.  It could stand to be a bit larger. and include a few pages to store CDs like the u0026quotCaselogic CD Organizeru0026quot.As most Caselogic products it appears that it is very  durable. This is great for storing a portable CD player.  I dont know how  well it works for DVD players which are usually a bit larger. but it works  good for my portable CD player.This reminds me of a miniature version of  the padded laptop computer bags.  I would recommend this if your are  looking for a bag to store both CDs and the player.,4,1,573
A21B8AV7E3MPXE,1414,With all the tablets and apps out we dont really need EReaders anymore.  I am not exactly sure why I wanted a e reader.  I mean.  I have a iPod. iPad. Kindle. Regular Nook.  iPad Mini.  iPhone. Blackberry Playbook.I decided to sell my Kindle Fire and my previous Color nook tablet and upgrade to the snow nook HD and its beautiful.  it also has google apps on here now so we can get a lot of android apps. including the AHEM Kindle app.I like the nook friends and borrowing books options as well as how clean the OS is.,5,1,519

A21BPO81U7R7GE,0,The headset is a bit bulky. Not very comfortable to wear. I could hear the other person talking to me very clearly. However. when I spoke. he could not hear me at all. The boom microphone was not working from the first use. Would not recommend you purchase this.,1,0,262
A21BR2RBZ35FHH,13,This is a handy accessory.  Had I bought it at the list price. I would have been a bit disappointed.  This is an example of how things are not as simple as you read.  That can be a good thing.  You DO have to know the sky to use this and the scope together!  Also the setup requires knowing true compass direction. the bright stars overhead. and it helps to have a GPS or at least a good guess at your lat. and long..  I have a Star Atlas 2000.0. but do not have all the names of the stars requested by the Autostar during setup.  I recommend picking the 2star mode .NOT the EASY mode. and select widely separated stars that 1. you can recognize and 2. are near the area you want to view...  This about doubles the accuracy.  Lastly 3. center the alignment stars in THE SCOPE not just in the view finder.  This is VERY IMPORTANT in the higher power ETX125.  Overall. it is great how it will maintain a track in the level alt.azamath mode.  That alone is worth the .price..,4,1,972

A21EQHA8EG9APE,0,Ive operated the 75822 for approximately 1 month before writing this review.  I will break down this review in 3 sections. highlighting the major aspects of owning a 75822.  The unit was operated with a Midland 182442 antenna. magmounted on the trunk of a 1999 Toyota Camry.INSTALLATION AND MOUNTINGMy intention was to install a CB radio into my sedan with minimal modification.  No holes needed drilling and no strange mounts needed installation to install the unit in a car.  All that is required is to plug it into the cigarette plug.  The first 2 weeks of operation. I placed the unit in a cup holder.  The second 2 weeks the unit spent its time on a homemade mount. which was a bent piece of sheet metal that was clamped in place by closing the ashtraycoin drawer.  The belt clip on the backside of the unit can be unscrewed and adapted for whatever installation purposes are desired.  I did not unscrew the belt clip as it was appropriate to slide it right over the sheet metal.MOBILE OPERATIONAfter the antenna was properly tuned with an SWR meter. the unit operated as one would expect.  The volume and squelch controls at the top of the unit are easy to turn and are ribbed for minimal slip .even with gloves on..  Manual cycling through the channels is performed by updown buttons on the side of the unit. above the PTT button.  While driving. operating the unit was found to be easy as operating the AMFM radio.  Two small drawbacks I found with the units screen in particular.  .1. The backlight turns off so nighttime operation is sometimes a nuisance.  .2. The screen contrast is strongly dependent on viewing angle...only looking at the screen straighton will give good contrast.  This issue is compounded during backlit nighttime operation.CALL QUALITYCoupled with a Midland 182442 antenna. I was able to estimate an average range of 3 miles on open road.  Unfortunately. open road .with CB users listening. is sometimes hard to come by when travelling around the Northeast!  Given the environmental conditions. the range was as short as 1 mile and as long as 6 miles.  Receiving skips was not uncommon and some of them were as easy to hear as if the individual was sitting next to you.  The speaker was sufficiently loud and as long as the transmission was strong enough. clarity was no issue.  During radio checks with other CB users. comments beyond the standard  loud and clear  on the clarity of my transmission was not uncommon.  Using the provided rubber ducky antenna and operating the unit on AA batteries. no noticeable changes in call quality were noticed.  It was indeed noticed though that the short rubber ducky antenna does not work very well inside a car and the signals were strongly dependent on the position of the unit.  The best signal quality was achieved with the units antenna sticking out of the driver side window...which resulted in no practical way to be driving.Unfortunately. I cannot comment on the lifetime of the AA batteries or elaborate on call quality in rubber ducky mode.  For mobile operation. I would strongly recommend an antenna.  As for its utility in backpackinghikingcamping. I am unable to comment.,4,1,3160
A21EZBJ219SYE6,11,Fixed the problem. Recorder did not recognize its own recordings and I could not finalize the disks. Could not read the disks invalid disk error message. I started having these problems after recording about 100 DVDs. After running the cleaning cycle everything returned back to normal. Speaker test was also helpful polarity was reversed in one of the speakers.,5,1,362
A21F4AWEU0JXW3,1819,After spending several days tracking one of these down. I finally got it installed on my laptop. Thats when the problems started. .1. My laptop routinely fails to recognize the USB connection. No better results on either of the two desktops I tried as well. .2. Customer service is a joke. You can stay on hold for hours while the company conducts departmental meetings or trains the morons that work there. .3. email support results in an immediate automated response. but then itll be 34 days before you get an actual response .I guess the u0026quoteu0026quot in email stands for u0026quoteventuallyu0026quot  have fun not using the thing while you wait for someone to help you. .4. The software is not very userfriendly. but then neither is the company.While I enjoy hearing the initial music I loaded onto the unit. no one can seem to figure out how to obtain a relaible connection so I can change the tunes around. It works fine  when it works. All in all youd be better off spending your time and money elsewhere.,1,0,1019
A21FMXVF31CAQL,37,This articulates BUT it does not tilt up u0026 down without unloosening a bolt and tightening it back.  In other words. the vertical tilt is fixed once you set it. so if you intend to adjust it that way move up to a more expensive unit.,2,0,236
A21GQD1LMQTXKD,11,I own a specialty DVD shopping site.. like those Multipleangle DVD. Interactive DVD...  We ship worldwide so we have to test every single DVD from defect before we ship them.

A21J7TC00MICKM,0,My husband bought me the Nook for my birthday and immediately I fell in love with it.  I am an Army wife and a new mom. so I am constantly on the go and dont have much time for reading. so checking books out from the library always requires me to either renew the book two or three times or return it before I have finished.  With the Nook. I can spend as much time as I want reading my books and do not have to worry about overdue fees.  Plus. now when I buy books. I do not have to fill up valuable space with the books that I have read.  The Nook is very portable and even fits into my purse.  The small touch screen at the bottom is great. too.  It is small. so the keyboard may be difficult for those with larger fingers. but I find it great and easy to use.  All around I think this is the best birthday gift Ive ever received.,5,1,833

A21OA8773GTIKD,13,A couple of the tapes required break in and I suggest a fast forward and rewind before you start recording. I have DMRs and record TV shows on EP mode. Both sound and video are good even on a 60  3D Plasma and 350w sound system.,5,1,228
A21OFCVU93J9BJ,0,We also tried the Belkin F5U002 USB Parallel Printer Adapter.

This cable will NOT work with the Epson Stylus  Color 600. so dont waste your time.,1,0,406
A21PD6NH1LGJYM,89,I bought three of the Simple Touches for my three kids .ages 7. 8. 9. for Christmas with the express purpose of allowing them to borrow books from the library. However. I have several MAJOR personal issues with these Nooks.1.. All three of them have been getting the same error message. which Customer service told me requires me to completely erase all the user data and start over again for each one...including redownloading the books.2.. None of the library books will download automatically over the wifi. like they do on my Kindle. There is a multistep process that requires me to download them onto Adobe. hook up the Nook. and drag each download onto the Nook.3.. There is no way to delete books on the Nook itself. You have to plug it into the computer and actually log into the account  then delete it there. This is EXTREMELY time consuming when you have three kids who want help with this.4.. Bu0026N puts unasked for samples of books as well as full free books onto their Nooks. As a parent. I DO NOT want my child having access to this adult content !!!!! Customer service states there is no way to put parental controls or any other way to limit this. This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! And again. the only way to get these things off is to hook up to the computer. log in to each kids individual account and delete it off. because you cant do it directly on the Nook. This is a MAJOR pain. considering how often these things are currently showing up on the Nook.,2,0,1478
A21PJEIX2MIM1X,35,Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.  For the first hour or so. I was extremely frustrated with this product.  I tried changing the frequency. the volume of the transmitting speaker. and the location of the wireless speaker a few times. with no luck. no sound.  After some fiddling it would transmit sound for about one second and then go silent.  It finally sounded like it had blown.  It got very loud. very staticky .sp?.. and then went silent.  The power light turned on and off.  It did this about three times.  I was about to give up.  I gave it one more go. and it worked!!!  I kept the frequency. and even moved the speaker a couple of times to see how it would operate.  It is still working.  It is not a high end speaker. but for the price. and what I am using it for.  I am very pleased.  It does what I bought it for.,4,1,835
A21PY549E3M51S,33,I bought this drive to go with my Netbook. since netbooks are too small for a drive with removable media. I based my decision on size. price. and the fact that you do not need to use two USB cables to power this up. This plays CDs and DVDs as well as any internal drive in a laptop. I can watch movies. play music and install software. No big deal to pack it with the Netbook and take it with you. Excellent product. would highly recommed.,5,1,439
A21Q1LBZP2671X,22,I got these for Christmas one year and had a really difficult getting good sound out of them. I wanted to use them for my PC to play music around the house. At first I would get very soft sound and sometimes no sound at all. I shelved them for a while and then decided to try them on my PC again with a Soundblaster 16 sound card. Excellent sound. These speakers are not for the impatient person. I do have the transmitter sitting on the top floor on a high shelf so that it can get go transmission. The transmitter can not be surrounded by anything. I can get a good 100 ft out of the speakers. Then I start losing signal. There are times that I get a beeping sound of them. For some reason that does subside. I do recommend them for the price. Beware it might take some time to find the right niche for them.,3,0,810
A21QJSLAHD50IW,2021,The product is probably good but all the parts was not included.  Have tried to get the antenna from company but am told that it is our os stock.  This was a Christmas gift so he is disappointed.,2,0,195
A21RNCD4BOJEC8,0,Bought this in November 1999. even after reading the other reviews...  Suffice to say. it is all true.  While the promised functionality is great. after a u0026quotsuccessfulu0026quot programming of the unit. it correctly switches about one out of every four or five times to the device you select.  Maybe one out every two I could have lived with.  Three hours of my life were wasted...,1,0,387
A21RO7OWHHHUOK,33,Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4. which I was looking to improve. Theres some static on all recordings. and Im not sure what to do about it. It was cheap. so Im not too broken hearted about it...,2,0,208
A21SLT8FI7FS9C,0,Our senior mobile home park has equipped its emergency response team members .we are in an earthquake area. with the Midland radios. They operate clearly within our 50 acre park. even when broadcasting inside  homes with metal siding. The scan feature allows different layers of  simultaneous net operation. The most amazing thing is how much power is  packed into such a tiny package. Definitely a five star product!,5,1,417
A21TARVWACB6DH,2727,the merchant is great and responsive but the charger did not fit my equipment.  they offered to refund my money but since it happens to fit my cell phone. i kept the charger.  i would buy from this merchant again. the charger just wasnt correct.,2,0,245
A21U0FOXU1FXXS,0,It plays games real good. no problems. installation was a snap. But plays some of my movies in asf format real bad. Bunch of yellow lines and crap. comes with nfs3. descent. and some other game,4,1,193
A21UJX5CMQWMDC,1,This is an easytouse basic ebook reader.  My wife especially likes it because of its simplicity of operation.  However. right now it is totally frozen.  I cannot turn it on or off.  This is not the first time either.  We have had it refuse to connect to wifi before and had it freeze up before.  I will take it in to a Barnes and Noble store when I get the chance. however that is about a 2 12 hour trip for me.  What I have been told is that software upgrades are often buggy and create these types of issues.  It seems oftentimes when they have buggy upgrades it then takes several days or weeks to fix them.  While I like the Nook when it works it gets frustrating to deal with the issues.,2,0,692
A21W0IH6WAWVK8,12,JUNK!!!!!! Ordered two different radios from different places. First radio drove across three states and heard and contacted nobody. Radio was faulty. Returned. Ordered second and no signal with flexible antenna. Radio faulty again. JUNK I say JUNK. Stay away from midland Corp!!!!! Customer service sucks as well. Two to three days to hear any response from Corp.,1,0,364

A21YS7I7J81L1U,0,When I first reviewed this product back in January 2000. I gave it only two stars because I was disappointed with the construction of the case which. I still believe. is kind of cheap considering the cost. But I have been using this case to protect my Palm for almost a year now and it has never been damaged in all this time. even despite the fact that I have dropped it at least 68 times. I even dropped it on a concrete floor in a parking garage!While I certainly dont want to give anyone a false sense of security  Im sure the Palm would break if it falls hard or often enough  this case has been well worth the money and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their unit but doesnt want the bulk of a leather case.Here are some other comments on functionality.1. The inside front cover of the hard case is the perfect place to put the graffiti stickers that come with the Palm. They actually look like they belong there.2. The inside back cover is the perfect place to stick a business card in case the unit gets lost and is miraculously picked up by an honest person.3. The case can sometimes get in the way of beaming. I have had no trouble beaming to other Palms. but I have had to open the back of the case in order to beam to a Handspring. This may be due to the weird placement of the Handspring IR port.4. I have only experienced once or twice the problem that others have described involving the accidental pressing of the contrast button on the top left of the Palm. I dont consider it an issue.5. Even though the case doesnt *snap* shut. it should still shut securely and both front and back should be flush with each other as long as the cases spine is placed precisely centered in the Palms stylus slot. If your case does not shut correctly it is because the palm and case spine are misaligned.Happy shopping.,4,1,1848
A21Z76C7PXY1YU,3637,Piece of s***. Just spend the 4 extra dollars and get a good cable. Perfect example of you get what you pay for.,1,0,112
A21ZVN3AH1P55B,0,The cord was purchased on Amazon and came in Belkin packagingso I am assuming it is real Belkin equipment.  I have always bought Belkin because I think the quality is decent for the price.  All I can say is that this cable is really slow.  it slows down the speed of my computer.  I was using a 25 foot cord which one of the plugs broke and that is much quicker than this one.  There is no difference in the speed of my 6 foot to 25 foot cords. but this cord is just slow.  That is why I put the rating at 3.  If you do not care aout speed then the cord is fine.,3,0,562
A2204X7CVIO4LQ,24,I received this player through a computer package deal. At first I thought I had a problem when the unit was shaken.it made an awful sound and seemed to freeze up. After a while this went away .I was about ready to contact  customer service.but hey it stopped right? Another peeve has got to be  memory. why so little ?.32mg.. I find that If I don`t use the high quality  setting. the songs have skips.hesitations.and they are sometimes cut off a  little at the beginning or end. High quality downloads only get you about  six songs.!..this. and the expensive cost of additional memory cards makes  me feel like using it as a door stopper! Also.trying to find decent free  downloads off the internet is like pulling teeth. Basically I just download  my own cd music and use it with an adapter in my car until I get sick of  those six songs.then I download more. But please people. don`t take my word  for it go out and get one for yourself and all your friends.It is after  all. cutting edge technology !,2,0,1004
A2211XQCAX9TD4,2125,A great little radio. I used it on my flight from AZ to NH. The FM and AM came in just great. Not sure about the shortwave as I wasnt able to pick up anything. But then again. I didnt really try. I like the small size. Fits in my jacket pocket. A smart looking radio. Price is reasonable.CON. The ear plugs are useless. Will not stay in the ear.,5,1,345
A222PTRQBKQKX6,0,The directions for this mount arent real clear as far as connecting it to your TV.  But for the price. it was worth it.  I have it holding a 55 inch Samsung.,4,1,157

A2233FJA4QHDWS,0,Reading some of these other reviews makes me wonder if were talking about the same player here.  Ive had mine for over a year now and havent had a single problem.  I dont play CDs on it. but its handled every movie Ive watched without a hitch.  Based on my experience I can only recommend it very highly.,5,1,304
A223MRTJ2NPK2K,22,While the hardware is acceptable. B u0026 N locked up the operating system to make the Nook Tablet virtually unusable as a Android. device.

I am sorry I did not return it and get a general use Android tablet from Samsung or whoever.,1,0,356
A22482O4U1DC16,77,Although at first these seem like theyll do the trick. a number of poor design features make these a much poorer choice than some other brands. Advents are several years behind the leaders in technology and design. yet Advent charges a premium price. After looking at other brands in the same price range. Im amazed that anyone buys Advent headphones. These should really be bagainbasement phones. Heres why.1. Highly uncomfortable. I couldnt stand to wear mine more than an hour or so because of pressure on the ears and head. My ears start burning and I get a headache. They are noticably uncomfortable after 10 minutes. Supposedly they are selfadjusting. but they always clamp my head and ears too tightly  perhaps the designers thought Id wear them while jogging. Its true they are cushioned  but howd you like to have someone pressing cushions hard against your ears for hours? An earvise I dont need! And there is no way to manually adjust so they dont press as hard. Bottom line is that I dont use these at all because theyre so uncomfortable. I checked out a Sennheiser headphone set in a store .havent bought them yet. and they were much. much lighter. didnt clamp hard. and so much more comfortable. Weight on Sennheisers is listed in specs as only 3.5 oz with battery! The battery pack for the Sennheiser I looked at in the store is TINY. while the Advent takes 3 AAA batteries .so theres extra weight there..2. Advent sound quality is good. but as others have complained. the tuning of the transceiver and headset drifts often. I need to retune headset to tranceiver every 10 minutes or so. Otherwise. the sound keeps cutting out like when youre listening to a radio station while driving through mountains. Another design annoyance is that the tuning wheel is identical in size and is right next to the volume wheel on the headset. so theres a good chance that when youre trying to retune youll turn the volume knob instead and blast the top of your head off!3. The battery system is really REALLY lame! The battery system alone will make you curse the day you bought Advent. With Sennheiser .and I think some other brands. you can purchase an additional battery pack that charges in the base of the tranceiver when youre using the other pack in the headphones. Then. if the headphone battery pack runs down. you can just swap for the fresh pack. With the Advent youre stuck with one set of batteries. In order to recharge them youve got to stop using the headphones and plug the headphones into a charger and wait for hours. The only other option is to buy your own additional batteries and buy a generic recharger. So thats additional expense plus a big mess of having an additioanal charging unit sitting around.The whole charging system is poorly designed. Sennheiser and some other brands have u0026quoton standu0026quot charging. With u0026quoton standu0026quot. when you put the headphones on their stand. they charge automatically. .I have a great wireless phone headset by Vtech that charges by induction when on the stand. so this technology is available.. With Advent. you have to plug a charging wire into a small hole in the headset. This means a. you need to find the wire and plug it into the small hole and b. you have an extra wire running from the tranceiver to the headset when charging. So you have a real rats nest of 3 cords  the tranceiver power cord. the audio input cord. and the headphone charging cord. Plus. as mentioned above. if you want an extra set of batteries to charge. youll have to have a generic charger sitting around too with its cord.Yet another problem with the battery system is that. as mentioned. Advent uses 3 AAA batteries. This means that if you did want to buy your own batteries to use as backup when the Advent batteries run down. youve got to pull out three AAA batteries. replace the little cloth u0026quotpull out the batteriesu0026quot tab. and then insert three new batteries. This is a big pain compared with Sennheiser that uses a single popin battery pack.Jeeze! Didnt Advent bother to look at their competition before designing something that works like a 10year old prototype?,1,0,4150

Ive dropped it twice. once 5 ft on hardwood floor. the other time only about 4 ft on the floor of the school hall. it went flying down the hall a bit cuz the headphone wire got caught on someones backpack. It  survived these drops .and not to mention people hitting it to test its esp.  without even a scratch. I think there may be a difference in reliability  between the car version and regular version. because all the reviews that  say they got the car kit version are good reviews. and also read the  DE456CK reviews as well to back this up.  I can use it in my pocket  walking without esp on and it wont skip. the only thing ESP would be  needed for is to keep it from skipping while you are trying to damage and  break it. plus it sounds better with the esp off. I use koss sporta pro  headphones which sound great.,5,1,898
A226JYW3JYULI6,33,I like this protector for the most part. but it doesnt fit my keyboard exactly even though my Lenovo is a model they advertise for this. The protector bunches up in the middle. so I have to type through a  bubble . Its almost like its a tiny bit too wide. because it fits nicely on the outer portions of the keyboard. but in the middle it doesnt. Kinda frustrating... Not frustrating enough for me to bother paying return postage to send it back. but just a nuisance...,3,0,469

A2277LIWXVJRM1,4,This product is false advertising. I own the Sony HVRA1U. It DOES NOT have any HDMI out. It has Firewire. Usb .for photos.. Component out and AV out. No HDMI. Dont buy this if you own a Sony HVRA1U.,1,0,198

A229F2NY4IRMF0,0,I decided to get the .newer. 2020 Zoom and I am also very satisfied with it. The 2020 Z can be had for about the same USDUSDUSD as the 2000. The lack of sound when recording quicktime movies isnt really a concern. I think Ill  wind up buying a Sony digital 8mm camcorder soon anyways...I also bought  a microtek CameraMate smartmedia card reader .USB. to hook up to my PC. Had  to upgrade the PC from win95 to 98 though. in order to activate the usb  ports.I bought an additional 32MB smartmedia card and a Flashpath floppy  adapter. as well. The flashpath works just fine. but its slow. Also. you  have to install the special flashpath software before using it. which  Olympus does not tell you in advance. So you need to keep the software with  you if you want to be ready to move files to u0026quotanyu0026quot pc. Other than  that. its OK. I mostly got it for ease of connectivity between my home and  work pcs. laptop. etc.For the price of the C2020Z. the flashpath  adapter should be included. as well as the case. expect to shell out  another cnote if these are important to you. It would also be nice if  Olympus had designed a special onepiece battery for the 2020Z. as many  manufacturers do. Transferring the four AAsize batteries in and out each  time for recharge is a pain in the neck.Overall. these are minor gripes.  The camera is outstanding in every other way. and I highly recommend it.,5,1,1405
A229IY1MKD2K2I,1819,The Palm III is just a great thing you want to carry everywhere with you. This case just looked great and I would tend to trust 3com for the quality of their products... Bad idea. The day after I bought this case. I found a  nice crack on the screen of the palm. No way to know what happened but I  did not do anything special and can not remember any peculiar shock. I must  have just carried the palm in the case on my belt most of the time. and in  my front pocket one hour as I used to do before to buy the case... Sad  story. I will end up with the fast but expensive .USD100. replacement program  of 3com. Think twice before you buy this item!,1,0,649
A22A0AJX8ASBHB,1623,Excellent receiver.I was looking for a basic surround sound receiver at a reasonable price.This matched my needs very nicely.The sound is more than adequate for me.If you are looking for booming bass and many EQ settings this receiver is probably not your best choice.but so far I have no complaints.,4,1,300
A22A28CW42M1M9,0,Nice having a speaker mic. Setting the channel on the radio and putting it in the side pocket of the pack and only having the speaker mic on the shoulder strap. Too bad Motorola can not reduce its weight. When hiking. every ounce counts.,4,1,237
A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,34,I have found. through my experience. that Maxell XLII high bias cassette tapes are highly durable. long lasting. and play back very clear sound.  While high bias tapes are not the absolute best for recording from CDs .metal bias tapes are.. they are a big step up from normal bias tapes.  I have used these Maxell tapes for about 15 years for everything from voice recordings. to sound effects. to music.  About 10 years ago I started getting into CD burning for some of my music needs. including burning my own original music from tapes onto CD through the computer. but I still use these Maxell tapes to this day for certain things.Cassette tapes and tape decks are becoming more and more a thing of the past.  If you still have use for them. then I highly recommend these Maxell tapes.,5,1,788
A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,23,These Maxell 8 mm camcorder tapes are a pretty good product.  I bought these years ago when I needed to borrow my brothers camcorder that requires 8 mm tapes.  Nowadays. theyre getting harder and harder to find. as everything now is digitalhard disk.  The picture and sound quality on these tapes isnt quite as good as the more expensive 8 mm metal tapes. but its decent enough to do an adequate job of capturing your moments.  I swear. the picture and sound quality on the 8 mm camcorders and 8 mm metal tapes is sometimes better than some of the topoftheline hard disk camcorders.  I have a hard disk camcorder. but sometimes I wish I had an 8 mm camcorder.I recommend these Maxell 8 mm tapes. but I would try to get the metal kind if you want REALLY good picture and sound quality.,4,1,784
A22BWYMWTU93NU,11,Other than the remote. the other accesories in this pack are not to die for. The base is dinky. the battery you can get at  any drug store and the case. while it is very nice. can not hold the remote or the base .really dumb marketing move..,4,1,241
A22C2HG8EGTREJ,78,I got this camera at Best Buy. I wanted to get in touch with my falmily in Wisconsin so I tried this camera. It is the best one I have seen so far. I bought another less expensive one for my parents and I regret it. their picture is always poor and blurry and they always say they can see ME clearly on netmeeting. It is sleek and light. The best thing. the picture quality. Bad things. It is a bit unstable and tends to fall from my monitor from the cable weight. also my opinion is that the usb cable is too short. In summary great buy. dont waste your time on others.,5,1,570

A22FB2WSZSXSHH,11,I bought this for my daughter. Im the writer shes the reader..so it fit. lolThis cover is beautiful. and sturdy. Makes the nook have the look and feel of a real book.

A22FKU0R6QOZ8N,12,I purchased the Olympus 340R in the summer of 99 for around USD350. So far it has proven to be nothing less than spectacular. The image quality is excellent. Most of my pictures are of friends and families indoors. at  bars. or sometimes outside. Download time seems to be pretty quick. I  purchased NiMH rechargable batteries and the battery life has been  excellent. Perhaps the only feature I wished I had was a ZOOM. But for an  entry level camera this one is hard to beat.,5,1,477
A22H8Y1J3EW2N8,1314,My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently. this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.

A22HLAEHJWC6UY,13,You might be interested in buying these headphones and dont worry its not a waste of money. If you compare to other you may see that the other main thing is a much highter price. If you are looking for something inexpensive then this is the product. I have owned mine for about a month and I cant say its been a 100% OK. Sometimes the tone goes down and sometimes statics comes on because I walking too far. Its say you can be over 300 feet away but I can never do it. The beiggest problem that I had with mine was that when I put it in the chager the charging light never came on and when it did it use turn off and I had to ajust it again and again. But over all I think they are a great value for price you may get. I dont think you will be disappointed. After all under .USD. wireless headohones ....its a steal. So. think carefuly and see if they are righ for you!  THANK!,4,1,877
A22HO0ABH6W9K6,619,This is a pretty good cover. right up to the Moleskine standard.  Too bad one of the 4 elastic corners covers up the onoff switch.  And since it has a note pad. too bad it doesnt have a pen holder.  These are just minor though.  I really love the leather and the overall quality.,4,1,279
A22IA58NFO6C7C,0,Well I bought a NOOK Tablet last year and it was great for about 1 month after the time of purchase. Since then. I have had to get a replacement and now the replacement is giving me lots of problems. Barnes and Noble keep telling me that my device has a manufacture defect. yet they wont issue a refund. I would not recommend this device at all. unless you are really into books and have the patience and energy to keep fighting with a company that doesnt see their mistakes. Also. the app store and email app is upsetting. The app store is blocked so that you are only limited to Bu0026N app store which doesnt offer much. There are no messaging apps available for this device. The email app is very out of date. and limited. Please consider all of the pros and cons before you waste your money on something that will only give you headache after headache.,3,0,857
A22II2FFHT4PBM,11,Used this for two weeks on a scout trip and it worked well.  Could hear and be hard on it.  Took it of the shelf and keyed it up with the same radio and it shut the radio down.

A22IV7E05GPOUJ,1,I favor the soft warm light of the Mighty Brights with bulbs.  I also have some spare bulbs and wanted to get another unit.

A22J3919D6DZU5,0,I had the same problem as other reviewers with these speakers but tried to move them outside as another person suggested. Once I did that. they worked for a while. I found though that if you use batteries and not the AC adaptor. they seem to work just fine. It takes 8 C batteries though so prepare to spend some money on rechargables!Advent .aka RCA. need to shield these speakers from outside interferance for these to get a better review.Once they finally started working. they sound pretty good for a lowend speaker system.,2,0,527

A22KS97E1Z0DN5,0,Ignore the reviewers who say youre stupid if you have trouble with Skipdr  it does work. but it can take a few tries to get used to it.The first time I used Skipdr. I was mortified.  The disk came out covered in needlesized white scratches and suddenly would not play in anything.  I read and reread the instructions. but couldnt figure it out.Fortunatley. I kept trying.  Eventually I realized that the disk just wasnt wet enough.  When they say spray the disk. they mean really SOAK it. and keep spraying you work.  .Cant have too much fluid!.  Also. turn the crank quickly to get smooth action on the wheel.  Mine pops and jolts when I turn it gently.Skipdr took some time for me to figure out.  Getting the instructions only slightly wrong can cause serious problems.  Use a lousy disk you dont really care about to experiment. then move on once youve got it right.,4,1,869
A22KW5YWAI5YDO,11,Good  headphones.  I like .very much. that they only have a wire on one side  and they are lightweight..The sound is pretty good. I enjoy using them.,4,1,149
A22M8JKEMEW4BI,0,Do not buy a Nook!!!! Spend you money else where. We have both a color and a black and white. Both are less than a year old and have had to be replaced already.

BAD NEWS!!!!,1,0,367
A22MHWKRGV89RZ,35,I bought 3 of these this year.  I guess out of habit.  They seem a bit loose where they plug to the slot. but maybe thats normal.  It didnt keep me from buying 2 more of them.,4,1,175
A22NBW4PKXG660,0,THsi item did not work at all. I bought it for a trip to Italy. lugged it all the way over there and it did not work  the pushout plugs would not stay engaged.  I borrowed an adapter from the front desk and it worked fine.  You probably do not need a transformer product like this as most devices you will want to use are already dual voltage .computer. phone. rechargable camera batteries. etc..  Just buy a plug adaptor and you will be fine.,1,0,443
A22NZFCXVF7Y51,66,The sound quality is good. I purchased these to plug into walkie talkies. As someone whos been use to wearing the actual walkie talkie unit on his pants I had to begin to clip it on my shirts because the plug and its cord are short and tight. If I wear the walkie on my belt and have the speaker on my shoulder. the audio jack always pulls out of the walkie unit because of the tension.For my purposes these are not ideal and if you are use to wearing the walkie unit on your belt line then dont purchase these.If youre okay with wearing the walkie unit on your shirt or somewhere a lot higher than your belt line then go for it.,2,0,629
A22P7ZQQBC7IL7,0,Nice machine so far so good a couple months now.  my old JVC finally broke it had a lift up plastic cover so you could change disc without stoping music. Semms like the random play could be more random tends to stay on same disc for number of songs. maybe intentional.,4,1,268
A22PER4P3LP2PU,0,I purchased 4 of these for my 4 channel DVR.2 of the 4 couldnt be focused.  The adjuster screw that focuses and zooms werent properly attached to the inside lens.  Turning it did nothing.  I had to open up the unit. unscrew the orb and manually turn the focus wheel with a long thin tool.  It is very hard now to focus it once its mounted since everything is internal.Also. the color reproduction is horrible.  Even when tested indoors. everything seemed almost Bu0026W and very faded.  I tried ATW. Auto and other settings but nothing helped.  Night vision is good but only because of all the IR leds.  Save your money and try another company.,1,0,644
A22PS68JS6ZLHP,0,Yes. it is a 50 ft CAT 5e cable.It is NOT a Belkin cable with the wingflap antisnag.

You can play your music as loud as you want without a bit of distortion!  The only negative point I see would be the cassette player which looks very  nice but maybea little cheap and complicated. a door similar to the one of  the CD player opens and a little rack pulls out.,5,1,417

A22U6OTGZK6G8W,0,I must first say that I did some quite extensive research before investing in my 315.  I bought it for a trip to Cyprus.  While there I went off to Isreal and Egypt.  With its world wide datum I was easily able to track and  navigate my position.  Just to see how acurate it was I tried it while on a  Boweing 777 to London and it tracked me at 695mph and at 38000ft.  After  trying on land and in air what is left but on water.  On a ship bound for  Port Said. Egypt .listed in the world datum. I was able to plot a course  for the port and see the distance and time ETA as well as the speed and  bearing.  A lot of the reviews I read complained about the battery life. no  problems here.  The entire trip for me .all three countries. I only changed  batteries once.  Overall. a great tooltoy.,5,1,794

A22VIZ9UXTX5KW,0,I purchased a DC240 online on 83199.  I am a semi professional photographer and wanted to try digital.  The resolution sounded alright and the features seemed about the best that I could get without spending a huge amount of money.  I have been having some health problems and didnt get to use the camer very much.  In fact. there is a counter built into the camera.  I had only taken 241 pictures total in 15 months.  I attempted to use it the other day and the lens motor started making a noise and would not focus.  I called Kodak and they were not very helpful at all.  They said they had two repair costs. USD110 for minor repairs and USD275 for major repairs.  The told me to send the camera in to Rochester. NY .USD24 with insurance.They insinuated that the camera must have been dropped.  This is totally untrue.  As I said before. I am a real photographer.  I feel that they should have said that they would fix the camera under warranty due to the short time ago that it expired and how little use the camera had.  The camera sat for a year and wasnt used at all.  Now. I not only question the quality of the camera but also the customer service that Kodak offers.  This may not sound like a big deal to you but I ask you how you would have wanted to be treated if you had spent USD550 on a camera and then they wanted to charge you some huge amount to fix it.,3,0,1370
A22WB9NO9CGWP7,1116,I probably should have rated this 5 stars. but I chose 4 because I could not get audio to work from the evga geforce gtx 650ti in my computer to my m420nv tv.  I dont know if its the computer. the software. the video card. the tv. the or the cable and with so many things that could be wrong. I cant blame the cable until I know for sure.I also cant get the cable to work with my Nikon 3100 camera.  Again. I dont know what the problem is and until I can verify the camera connection working with another cable. I cant blame the cable.But. at this time. I cannot rule out the cable as the problem. either.,4,1,605

A22Y9D820GYWVI,0,Camera eats batteries like my dog eats treats.  Serial port connection lasted about 3 days.  The flimsy input inside the camera broke. and the camera no longer connects to a computer. thus rendering it utterly useless.  The battery compartment snaps shut with a small extended piece of plastic on the door.  That broke off and I have to hold the batteries in with a rubber band.  The picture quality is very poor. unless of course you want to capture the essence of walleye photography.  Whatever you do. stay away from this junk.,1,0,530

A230OZ6DNS1SWC,0,This is one of two APC UPS units that I own. I also own the more modern and lighter APC CS 350.The APC 650 is a slightly older UPS unit. Non the less just as reliable as the modern units in the CS series. Six 120V AC outlets. and phone line provide total industrial strength surge protection. As an older UPS this unit seems to regulate backup power better during a power outage. The backup power can last up to one hour with a properly maintained battery. PS2 9 pin computer port allows connection to a desktop PC.A word of caution. This is one of the heavier UPS units. So youll want to find a permanent location to install for this unit.If lighter weight is what your after. some of APCs more modern units might be for you. Otherwise. other than the weight. this unit provides unsurpassed performance and value. The best surge protection money can buy.,5,1,855
A231WM2Z2JL0U3,22,Ive owned mine for about 1 12 years now. and Im happy to say it gets more use now than ever. The camera is wellmade. the quality of the images is very good and the price and availability of media .both tape for movies  and the proprietary MultiMediaCards for stills. continues to improve .a 32  meg MMC costs about USD100 and holds 200 or so images.. I do seem to have a  problem keeping dust out of the viewfinder. but thats my fault for  shooting on windy days at some very dry baseball fields. The most useful  addition was a MMC reader. which makes downloading images to my  desktop simple and fast. I have not bought the FireWire setup yet. but  this is required for tape transfer to the desktop. All in all. this is one  of the most versatile cameras I have ever owned.,4,1,775
A231WM2Z2JL0U3,2023,Pick this camera up and youll be reminded of the heft of older. metalbodied 35mm film cameras. It seems that the SLR setup has added a significant weight burden. while supposedly lending better optics to the camera. In this price range. most digital cameras now offer potent optical zoom lenses .710x not uncommon.. while the 620 makes do with a marginal 3.1 setup. In addition. while most offer resolutions in the 3+ megapixel range. the 620 is a 2.1 megapixel camera. While there are some usercontrolled features that make it fun to use. it is still pretty much a computer chip controlled digicam with a particularly slow autofocus system. In this price range. Ill take the Olympus 700 anyday!,3,0,695
A231WM2Z2JL0U3,66,I have a 300 and now a 500. There are a few reasons this unit is a big improvement. Most impt is the USB connection. which makes uploading much faster and is conflict free. The software upgrades easily and the added memory capacity is thus doubled. If you download your songs at very high compression. sound remains good and capacity can exceed 3 hours.

As for more determined thieves. thats perhaps another story. Back up your data!,5,1,348
A231WM2Z2JL0U3,23,I have lots of Belkin cables. and they have never failed me. The screw down mechanism is well designed. and does not allow the screw to back out .and thus become MIA.. Also. because the screw downs are rubberized. they are easier to grip and tighten. I have bought one set of the expensive goldplated contact cables. but the added cost added nothing to performance.,5,1,365
A2327NQYT7T7KD,13,The sub is OK. rounds out a basic system. low price for basic performance.  However. the one I purchased stopped working after about a month of use.  KLH asked me to send the power unit into them for repair.  I have not heard one word from them since.  Phone calls and emails have not been returned.  It is like I never existed.  So be wary. sometimes buying cheap cost you in the end.,1,0,385
A232A5VLHTFFN0,1516,I bought this modem and actually got it to install on the first try! I noticed a problem with the speaker staying on. however. when I called Best Data tech support they pointed me to an alternate best data web page that did not belong to the company that had newer drivers that fixed the  problem!  Now it is working great!,4,1,323

A2375HJTXYJAJ,0,With the exclusion of parallel ports on the newer laptops. I had shelved my old Canon BJC 80 portable printer a few years ago. I needed a printer for the road so I went looking for an adapter for the old style printers to USB.Found It on Amazon. It was cheaper than the new version of the Canon portable printer.  I ordered it.received it. plugged it in. Though there was a thirty second to a minute delay. the printer works as good as ever. Thank you Amazon and Belkin,5,1,469
A237U3A3SHQ3WP,11,This tripod feels like it is very cheaply made. I dont care for the mount on it either. Yes it was very cheap. but for a few dollars more I have seen some much better products.,1,0,176
A238V1XTSK9NFE,0,If youre like me and have a digital camera that uses compact flash and a laptop that always has a free PCMCIA slot. this is an excellent value.  Leave it in your slot all the time. it wont have an effect on your system when the CF card isnt in. but it will permanently add a CF slot to your system.This means that you can dispense with the cameratocomputer cable and just plug the card into the slot.  When you do. it will be recognized as a removable disk. kind of like a Syquest or Zip disk. and show up in your u0026quotMy Computeru0026quot view or Mac desktop. and maybe .this is how Nikon View works anyway. pop up your digicam software.This really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptop.,5,1,738
A23956TW9D1LTN,5456,You cant beat the price for a full size tripod for your camera. Great for taking pictures of low light settings. night shots. etc. since the tripod will keep the camera still and wont blur the shot. The only bad thing is the shipping on this is more expensive than the tripod itself! Still worth it for about USD20.,5,1,315
A239ICGWDJSRW8,22,I switched from a cheapo shower radio I got at Bed Bath u0026 Beyond to this one. Boy what a difference. Much clearer. much louder.Remember. you have to hear a shower radio over the shower and the bathroom fan. so it does need to be loud. especially if you listen mostly to NPR like me. I had to turn my old one all the way up. and I still couldnt hear interviews well.One thing. the reason for the long battery life folks like here is because it takes C batteries. I used the AA rechargeables I was using in my old radio. and it works fine. fully as advertised. The battery life is satisfactorynot impressive. but OK for my purposes. But when they die. they dont fade or give warning. they just die.It is more expensive than I really wanted to pay for this purpose. but I did get value for money. Its a fine unit. and I recommend it.,5,1,834
A23AF9X5323ME3,22,The unit arrived in minimum time. had to drill out existing pivot bolts and install larger size to take out the sag or play. it works great. also I had to cut an area out from the bottom of the plate to have access to the hook ups.As I said you get what you pay for the unit was suppose to fit my vizio 26 inch tv.,3,0,314
A23C0R77ZP9Z84,11,An eReader without eink? Really?eReaders are devices dedicated to reading. and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eyestrain.By introducing a backlit eBook. Bu0026N removed the key point of eReaders.If you need a device that has a backlit screen .and can afford a USD283 device.. why wouldnt you pay the extra USD200 to get an iPad. which does the job much more efficiently?Please. correct me if Im wrong. because I really dont get the point of this device.Thanks.,3,0,477
A23CKO9CFCVRPJ,122,This product would not hold a charge. the customer service department at Barnes and Noble took 4 calls to try and rectify the problem.  None of the first two conversations were on record. the third conversation resulted in a less than satisfactory result.  The fourth conversation with customer service resulted in them sending me a certified USED product to replace the NEW one that I bought.  As I type this. I am on hold for 25 plus minutes trying to get someone to helP me.  I WILL NEVER BUY A BARNES AND NOBLE PRODUCT AGAIN.,1,0,529
A23DRB25HRL9J4,66,First of all. this nook is a BETA release.  When I first got it. as a gift for my mom. after I authorized it. I tried to buy a book for my mom.  It was Christmas. I could not pauy for a download for her nook because it was her account.  I could not download and pay for a book. from the Barnes and Noble Nook Book store.  Just yesterday I ordered and paid for another book from the B u0026 N store.  It took my money this time and sent me an email saying my book was ready for download.  I hit download and a message showed up saying the book was on the nook.  There was no book on the nook and there was no downloaded book anywhere on my computer. searched all drives including the nook drive.  I tried 3 times on live chat to fix it.  They kept transferring me to another deept and Id get cut off..  So Im out the  price of a book.  Whatever you do. DONT BUY A NOOK.  GET A KINDLE!!,1,0,884
A23EN1JWF1RQ1N,0,I didnt buy this to be an e reader but as a small tablet PC. and I was rather surprised with how well it works. Im using it much more than I thought I would. Most of the time I use an aftermarket Android OS .CyanogenMod. booting off a micro SD. theres no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this. With the aftermarket firmware. it also has Bluetooth. the micro USB can be used as a host USB with an adapter or USB gender changer. and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a PCs USB. normally it will only charge with the wall charger.My biggest complaint with the stock firmware is Bu0026Ns app store. the apps are fairly pricey. apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for. there are a few free apps from Bu0026N but not many. With the aftermarket firmware Im using the Amazon app market. much better selection and prices.Cons. The sound is about what I expected. fairly poor. but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker. The micro SD slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove. its located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner. its well protected there. just not easy to access. Dont expect to watch streamed HD video. however. sites like YouTube work fine.Despite the cons. I give 5 stars. I think its a great value. I have been very pleased with it.,5,1,1362
A23FKOXQHBR89R,23,I consider this cable to be better than the one I used before cause it works much better than all the other I used before.thanks,4,1,128
A23ID71VXIBR8T,0,I bought this for my spouse.  It is everything we could ask for.  I have a Kindle Fire HD and love it.  But this was 32 gb and does everything my Kindle does except it cost 200.00 less.  I recommend it very much!,5,1,212
A23JKT81U7UIQ0,33,This CB radio was purchased for the express purpose of a communications device to be used exclusively on a motorcycle for bike to bike communications and weather info. It is very small and works perfectly. I had to make a holder with bracket. but that only took about 20 minutes. I purchased a separate headset kit to fit the helmet. but after all that. I still only had a total of USD165. in all for my complete setup. My other biker friends spent up to as much as USD800. This little gem does everything theirs do and more.,5,1,525
A23JTR4D6YFA1X,1416,Movie quality not as good as I had hoped. but it is a 40 yr old VHS tape I ordered!  Thrilled it was even still available.

Fun to watch with my family and see familiar faces and places.,4,1,334
A23JYBX1Q54LB1,0,I received the Nook .WiFi. for Christmas 2010 and I loved it from the moment I powered it up and read my first book. At first I was against ereaders since Im a book nerdI love the feel of the pages. the smell. etcbut the Nook made me change my way of thinking regarding ereaders. Navigation is simple. adding books is a breeze .Ive used both Bu0026N and Calibre software.basically everything you want to dochange is laid out in an amazingly user friendly way.The only problem I had with the Nook was the eink screen. My three year old knocked it off the couch arm one day and it messed the screen up completely. even though it was in a case. Otherwise. I cant think of any issues Ive had with this product. Ive tried the Kindle and Pandigital ereaders. but neither one compares with the Nook. Its pretty close to perfect.,5,1,821
A23K0A6DL5HQQ3,22,I bought a refurbished Nook Color a few months ago as well as a dualboot android MicroSD card .from eBay..  This is by far the best value tablet Ive found anywhere!  NC is well made. arrived in likenew condition. reliable. responsive and by booting to full Android .with the dualboot microSD. it is a real tablet with full access to the Android market. Only cons are lack of microphone or camera. but for a total cost of u0026ltUSD180 its awesome!  Good battery life. beautiful screen. responsive and a really excellent reader .especially in low light  but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use..  I also have a Kindle keyboard which I love for daytime reading but the NC works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do.  Just NC on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind!  NC was perfect for email. RSS. games and reading. including pdf books and Netflix movies.  If you have an Android phone. using this is the same with a much better screen.  Its a really good tablet as is. but with the dualboot MSD card it is an awesome deal!,5,1,1085
A23K4UP4GC4F1D,33,This is a nice compact radio. ideal for the road and for emergencies. I use it on my motorcycle. Even though it is hard to hear. I am buying the ear piece next. which will help reduce the wind noise.,5,0,199

A23KMKQ0EN18BB,12,I should have realized that this mic does not support VOX. I guess when you buy a microphone its can be either PTT .push to talk. or VOX.Ill have to return this and get a VOX enabled one. though Im not sure which one at this point.,3,0,231
A23KRHS6GRUF5L,610,This is the second digital camera that I have used in the last 30 days  I started off with the Kodak DC280.  I like the Kodak controls better. but  the Olympus fits my hand well.The power switch on the Olympus is where  the shutter should be. and. the menu commands .such as delete last picture.  are not terribly intuitive.  Also. the flash is closer to the lens than the  Kodak. so redeye is more of a problem.  But. the 3x zoom makes the  difference for me. well learn how to use the controls.Definitely get  a USB PC Card reader to move the pictures to your PC. the serial connection  is VERY slow.  Finally. Olympus makes the mistake of giving you regular  alkaline batteries in the box. Throw them out. get some NiMH batteries and  avoid the frustration of having your batteries fail after 5 pictures and  thinking that something is wrong with the camera.,4,1,861
A23MH4H1CAZ5PP,77,Not being sure what was going on with our Philips DVD Recorder lately  it still plays okay. skipping occasional. but the recording feature has become utterly useless  I tried this product last week. It just has a small bristle on the DVD apparently to clean dust. Cleaned it multiple times. It didnt do a thing.I finally found a page on the badly written nonindexed manual of our recorder that says because of the high power used by the laser in the recorder. disc cleaners are a no no. You may want to refer to your manual before buying this cleaner.,1,0,551
A23N79UIUEA4EE,69,There is a slight delay when you push the PushToTalk button on the earbud.  However it works well.  I receive messages clearly.

A23N98ZC0H38L9,0,I was a bit surprised with this product. It was like working with a paper towel. Dried up and did nothing for my CDs or DVDs. It would be cost ineffective to send it back. but would never order it again. Just trashed it.,2,0,220

A23QZJI5LS3F5K,44,This system did not work for me. When I answer the phone it works for about a minute and then shuts off. The indicator lights on the base and extension are still on steady indicating the system is still on but no sound comes through. With the line still open. momentarily hanging up and picking up again restores operation but then it shuts down again in about ten seconds. I called their help hotline and after performing all their automated corrections with no results I got a live person. He didnt seem to know anything other than to send it to their repair station. But when two brand new units fail in exactly the same manner. it isnt a matter of repair.,1,0,659

A23RM4KRCEIDB6,78,When using this cable any monitor I attached to it would be Identified as a NonPnP Monitor.  This would prevent the computer from using the correct resolution and would also have the monitor searching for an input when the screens were put to sleep.  Removing this cable resolved the problems.Stills works as an extension cable.  If you dont care about the computer being able to properly identify the display then this cable will get the job done.  Unfortunately. this was not sufficient for me.,1,0,496
A23SARSJ1Q4G15,0,The cords I purchases were indeed 3 and function properly.  Be aware. however. that the cord pictured is NOT the item you will receive.

A23T9B9EXQOV5V,0,An attractive. flat. ergonomically shaped keyboard. I find the hand position comfortable. though others might prefer the humpback version espoused by Microsoft. The touch is easy and smooth. The touch pad has a pleasant tactile surface and is conveniently .for me. placed at the righthand end of the keyboard. My only dislike of the keyboard is that the .mouse. buttons are placed at the ends of the touchpad and do not fit the hand nearly as well as if they were placed below. This causes one to type with a high hand position which seems unnatural and for some might eventually create hand problems. Still. this is better than the center placement on laptops where the thumbs are constantly being dragged across the padto the extent that some manufacturers .HP at least.have placed an onoff switch at the top of the touchpad. I saw a number of desktop keyboards advertised with the center placement. and am of the opinion that they would be borrowing trouble.Finally. given the prevalence of laptops and touchpads. I am surprised that the manufacturers have not provided. and more agressively marketed. better touchpad keyboards than are available. All of the moderately priced  keyboards on the market seem to be models four and five years old. I have used a touchpad for years and find mice not only uncomfortable. but uncooperativeand space hogs as well!CA,4,1,1361
A23TAZKF1RA5FP,22,This is my second one...thie first one lasted 6 years and then it got annoying....slow. and sticky but i figured if it lasted 6 years it was a good enough product to buy another one!  I still like it...I like it better new!,4,1,223

A23VTNMZ8NECC,0,We needed this for vintage industrial equipment which normally has a long life.  It appears that the heads are out of alignment because anything it writes cant be read on other drives.  I tested it on Win8.1 u0026 Win7 computers.  The USB spec says that you should be able to plug it in then unlug it and then plug it in again and the driver is supposed to connect and disconnect each time.  On Win8.1 if you unplug it then you have to reboot the computer each time you replug it in.  The driver is slow to connect and unreliable.  It looks like a product but actually just wasted precious time in an industrial setting.,1,0,620
A23XZNBU2STNKP,33,I recently bought a music cd and wanted to transfer it to Itunes .and ultimately to my ipod. but when I inserted the cd into the cddvd drive of my 3 year old mac it would spit it back out.  I tried many times but it just wouldnt accept it.  That reminded me that over the last few months I had to insert some other cds multiple times before they stayed inside.  I didnt think anything of it at the time but the latest problem led me to conclude that there was something wrong with the cd drive.  I decided to try the low cost possible fix and ordered this cleaner.  I received it today and after a couple tries the mac accepted it and it did its thing.  After the cleaning was complete I tried the cd that I had the problem with and it went in and stayed in on the first try.  So. this product apparently did what I was hoping it would do and I am quite relieved that I hopefully wont have to have the mac cddvd drive fixed .it went out of warranty last month..,5,1,961

A23ZO0T85FDEJ4,0,I purchased a pair of these radios several weeks ago. They have worked very well for our family. So fair. we have taken them to large department stores when we are shopping together. It is nice to be able to be able to  keep track of each other and know precisely when my wife is finally heading  for the checkout line. She can even tell me the line in which she is  standing. There have also been times when we have taken them to the mall  when there are many things that we have to buy in a short period of time.  The radios have allowed us to coordinate our activity so we are out of the  mall in the shortest time possible. Also. I like to go running. but my wife  works second shifts. When I am on my nightly run. I stay in radio contact  with my eleven year old son. My wife and I are going skiing on Monday. Im  certain that the radios will be useful on the slopes. The midland radio  works well within a mile range. The signal become too weak to make out at  about 1.5 miles. We have kept our radios on channel 1. even though they  have 14 channels. We have not experienced any interference from other  users.,5,1,1117
A23ZWJ9CS8OG30,5051,Amazon is missing big by not supporting library eBooks on its Kindle ! I wouldve bought Kindle. since I prefer a physical keyboard. better battery life and lighter weight of the Kindle .plus a marginally better processing speed and eink technology.. but since my two library systems I belong to contain thousands upon thousands of digital books that I can borrow for 21 days at a time. buying the Nook was a nobrainier !I am cheapskate. so I very rarely buy a book  instead I borrow them from the library. Occasionally though I need to buy a book that is not available in the library at all. or in a digital format. or I need it for more than 21 days .as when I travel overseas.. so I end up just buying two digital books from Barnes and Noble for my Nook. Had Amazon not been so afraid of loosing sales by supporting library digital books .a groundless fear IMO.. I wouldve bought those two books from Amazon for my Kindle. instead of from their underdog competitor Barnes and Noble !,4,1,985
A240AEJAOJWNAF,33,I have owned several JVC products over the years.  The first was a portable radio many years ago.  I have in the past had excellent experiences with their products.  This model.however. is very inferior.  Within 2 months after my purchase the unit failed to place a CD properly into its tray and as the unit revolved the CD came completely out and jammed under a neoprene or plastic disc inside the machine and jammed the mechanism so that the tray would not open and scratching the CD beyond use.  I took the unit to an authorized repair shop and they at first could not find replacement parts. but latter discovered that JVC had issued a memorandum that the problem could be repaired by using a substitute part number.  The part was replaced and the unit worked great for nearly a year.  THEN THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN. RUNNING ANOTHER CD!BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!,1,0,882

A243GF4FL8TW1X,0,Flexibility comes at a cost in performance and this is no exception. Good product. put together nicely and has tons of features. Minor annoyances. the clip behind the radio is not the best feature. the LCD light does not stay on long enough. and the speaker volume should be louder. Lots of upsides .well covered in other reviews. with some minor but annoying downsides.,4,1,370
A243HY69GIAHFI,22,This device has essentially been eclipsed by its own success.  Now the solutionofchoice only for older machines .more than 2 years.. or for mobile professionals who want to make absolutely sure that theyll be able  to connect a ZIP drive to any PC they encounter. this most basic ZIP drive  should be avoided by most purchasers.Fact is. if you need to be mobile  with your ZIP. you should go the USB route these days.  Every new PC and  Macintosh comes with USB connectivity. and the difference in access speed  is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost.  This parallel port  machine is the very slowest ZIP drive available.  If  you download files of  any size .1M or more. you will notice the difference.Youll also notice  the difference between this model and an internal model.  Make sure that  you really need to be mobile with the drive itself before you choose an  external model.  As has been stated in other reviews. the ZIP100 has  become something of a standard nowadays. and many machines come with a ZIP  drive preinstalled.Also. even though the price is attractive. think  carefully about choosing this model if you plan to do much printing.  Most  printers use the parallel port. and although you can hook up both a printer  and this drive to the same port. you cant use both simultaneously.  This  is disasterous if you attempt to print a file from the ZIP drive.  It can  be done. but it takes a lot longer than printing from other drives.  Also.  forget about accessing the ZIP drive if youve sent a print command.  Your  parallel ZIP drive will be unavilable for the duration of the print.Having said all this. I absolutely agree with other reviewers who praise  the ZIP100 format.  Its got the broadestbased installation of any ZIP  format. so chances are youll be able to port your data more successfully  with a ZIP100 than any other format.  True. 100mb is starting to look like  small. but its still an awful lot of room for almost everything but  fullmotion. fullsound video.Still. I have to give this product fewer  stars than it wouldve deserved two years ago. simply because Iomega has  come out with better stuff in the interim.  For many users. it would be  wiser to buy an internal ZIP100.  Or. better still. buy an external USB  ZIP100 for current compatability. and leave the internal bay available for  future installation of a JAZ2MB.  That way. youll create a removable  media solution that handles both past and future needs.,2,0,2470
A243HY69GIAHFI,3131,This was my second attempt to get add a USB solution to my LAN. and it was fabulously more successful than the competitor by DLink.  It is the perfect solution for someone wanting to quickly add .and remove. a portable from a larger network. or to add a desktop thats already used all its PCI  slots on other kinds of cards.Installation was entirely easy.  The  documentation was superb.  I was up and running in literally ten minutes.There are drawbacks to this solution over the traditional internal card  solution. however.First. its only capable of 10BaseT connections.  This speed is more than enough for almost any possible current use. but  down the road a couple of years. this speed might well be insufficient.Second. unplugging  the device accidentally means reconfiguring it when you plug it back in.  This kind of thing cant happen with an inthebox PCI card.These are  minor annoyances though. at worst.  Overall. this is clearly an excellent.  lowcost solution that doesnt waste a valuable PCI slot on a fairly  routine matter of connectivity.,5,1,1056
A243HY69GIAHFI,2730,Certainly not the best speakers you could ever have for your computer. the ACS33 nevertheless fills an important niche in the market.  If youre looking for subwoofered sound on the cheap. this is probably your best bet.  Theyre competent performers. without taking price into consideration.  Look at how much they cost. and youll think there arent better speakers made on the planet.  They have the potential to work. as do most speakers. on both Macintosh and Windows machines.Interestingly. they also have a secondary use.  Because they dont need a computer to work at all. they can be plugged directly into any stereo system that has the ability to output its sound .that is. one which has an AUDIO OUT jack..  They can thus give resonant stereo soundeven to lowly portables.  Youll think twice about whether you really need to upgrade to a whole new system after hearing these speakers.  .Before buying for this purpose. however. Id recommend you go to alteclansing.com and grab the manual for this product. just to make sure that its compatible with your stereo..Inasmuch as there are drawbacks to the speakers. they are ones you would expect from a product so inexpensive.  As another reviewer has rightly pointed out. theres no volume control on the woofer.  Theres also no bass. treble. or speakerindependent volume control.  And the speakers are rated at only 10 watts. with a relatively indelicate frequency response.But. big deal.If. like most people. youve got your computer jammed into a corner in a busy room. you dont have the soundspace to set up a truly extraordinary auditory experience.  If youve got a lot of people living with you. anything more than 10 watts is discourteous. anyway.  Unless you have a room that you can dedicate to the computer. and thats relatively isolated from others. its extremely unlikely you would actually be able to use more than this system offers.,4,1,1898
A243HY69GIAHFI,1011,Ive had several pointing devices. including standard mouse. track ball. and pad.  None comes anywhere close to being as natural and useful a performer as this one.  Its simplicity of design hooks one almost  immediately. and within a few minutes of use. one doesnt want to go back  to the  mundanity of ordinary mice.  Unlike trackballs and most lowend  touch pads. its very sensitive. and so makes a servicable stepping stone  for grahpic artists on the way to purchasing a more serious graphics  tablet.If it has a flaw. its that its drivers seem too easily  overwritable by other pointing devices you may have on the same system.  Most people usually have only one pointing device. so this may be a  nonissue for you. but Ive found it difficult to run a serial and a PS 2  device. and still retain full functionality for both devices. This is  important to my needs. so I have to take a star away.Even so. this is a  fine mouse at a fantastic price.  As someone who has spent a ridiculous  amount of money on pointing devices. I wish Id started with this one  first.,4,1,1069
A243HY69GIAHFI,33,I found this product does almost exactly what it was advertised to do.  Ive had everything from a lowpowered joystick to a scanner plugged into  it. and havent experience many difficulties.  The only thing that threw it  for a curve was a USB ethernet adapter. which inexplicably stopped  functioning properly after a few hours of being plugged in to the hub.  Im  not sure why. but it had to be plugged directly into the computers USB  port to work reliably.That anomaly aside. the only thing I can think  of that it doesnt do what its packaging says it should. is add four ports  to your system.  It adds only three. because. of course. it has to be  plugged into one of your computers existing ports.  Indeed. every time  you add one of these puppies to your system youre only adding three more  ports. because one port always has to be used simply as a connector.Other reviewers have pointed out that it doesnt work well on Macs or  under Windows 95.  I unfortunately havent been able to verify either of  those statements. so Ill leave my review qualified to this extent.  by and  large. it works very well under Windows 98.  If you have Windows 98 or ME.  this is the USB expansion solution you want.,5,1,1206
A244SB4R5AVWMV,22,I installed a 45 inch TV. which weighs right at 50 lbs. on a brick wall using the supplied masonry anchors.  Nothing about this looked like it was going to work but it does.  The unit is solid as others have said.  There are no instructions for brick. line it up so the holes are in the mortar rather than bricks. that way you can patch the holes if you ever move it.  Also. the cable management clips are pretty flimsy.  Otherwise than that. no complaints.  A little graphite lube on the hinges .sold for locks. wherever keys are cut. is good advice.  One major complaint. about the way these are sold by Amazon  there are a bunch of different SKUs and you cant tell by this listing which one youre looking at.  Many of the negative reviews are related to this issue.,4,1,768

A2462LPFBLFKT6,0,I just got my mini mic and my Chill Pill Rapcap in the mail today.I bought both for my iPod Class 120gig for recording lectures. I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me USD.34 and just under USD4 shipping and rapcap was USD14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but Im confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.,5,1,1139

A2465OVDXMXNGZ,0,I like this mount because of the tilt function and more importantly. because of the extension.  I also like the multiple ways to attach the mount depending on the tv size.  It arrived on expected time and was fairly easy to install. If I ever need another mount.  I will buy another just like it.,4,1,296
A247FNRMYJ1WOX,0,I bought this product two days ago and thought it was broken.  The software and lack of documentation with the unit was a complete JOKE!  .I am a software developer and it took ME over three hours to get the thing to  work! . Once I got rid of the software that came with the machine I used  RealJukebox .which has drivers available for the Rio. and it worked  FLAWLESSLY! And the nice thing about RealJukebox is that you can save your  MP3s in playlists and then upload and download playlists to your RIO in a  matter of seconds. Once I got it working I am quite pleased with the size  and ease of use. One other thing.. I bought this unit BECAUSE of its size.  I hate working out with a bulky cassete player hanging off my shorts.,4,1,732
A247SHDMNB2PNZ,1012,I bought these for my kids to use on an airplane.  I did not have high expectations. since the price was so low. but one pair had lots of static and was unusable after approximately two hours of use.  Another pair is still usable. but has constant static.,1,0,255
A248GHSX039KV5,23,I have purchased two Super Radios over the years.  The first was purchased in the 1980s.  The second was purchased just over ten years ago.  Both worked well. but the case was worn. and the batteries fell out.  For that reason I purchased another Super Radio through Amazon.com that arrived last month.  I was very disappointed.  The AM band worked reasonably well. but not as well as either of the earlier sets.  However the FM band was defective.  The radio did not adequately discriminate between FM stations. especially in the lower part of the FM band.  Two stations at a time could be heard. though one would have more volume than the other.  Tuning was difficult over the whole FM dial. and there was usually a slight distortion.  The band width switch did not really help.  I was greatly disappointed. and returned the radio.  I often visit rural areas with low signal strength. and I wanted a fully functional Super Radio. Unfortunately. I did not obtain one. and it was been returned.  Now I must search for another radio that will meet my needs.,2,0,1056

A24EV6RXELQZ63,9099,Ive had mine for a year and heres what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed .according to this GPS. as a non truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half .of about 50. have crashed to an unrecoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? its a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a USD2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. Ive had mine for a year. I never noticed one update that corrected functionality. they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes. if I wanted tools Id buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.Wayne,1,0,1071

A24FRP1LRAK578,33,This drive certainly looks goodvery lightweight. plugandplay. powered through the USB cord itself. and thin enough to stash in even an iBook sleeve case.  And its reasonably priced.  Unfortunately it doesnt work on my two G4 computers. both running Mac OS 10.3.5.  My computers recognize the drive as being on the USB circuit .via System Profile.. but the drive just wont mount.  No drive icon on the desktop. no joy.  Ive tested the device by connectiing it directly to a powered USB hub and then connected it directly to each computer. it simply will not mount.  The drives LED lights up and the diskette whirs. but the drives desktop icon never appears.  I may have a faulty drive OR the drive may be incompatible with the drivers of Mac OS 10.3.5.  Ill update this later if I ever find out.One problem for ALL Mac users with USB keyboards. the drive does not get enough juice when plugged into the keyboard USB port too bad since thats the logical port to use.  At least I got a popup window alert about that.The device would be terrific accessory for an iBook or PowerBook.  But not until Y.E. Data can get this sucker to mount.,1,0,1133

A24GZSVSZQLPOH,1,What can I say....I always wanted to own these in college but never had the money to. Its been 4 years since. I recently managed to get my hands on one of the last remaining sets through underground channels and all I can say is Altec Lansings ACS 48 Powercube system still rules. Im compelled to compare them against the likes of Thiel. Vandersteen. Bu0026W who dont even make computer speakers but you get the point. dont you? If clarity of voice coupled with more than sufficient power .40W subwoofer + 20 W satellites * 2 = 80W.is what rocks your boat. well then welcome aboard !!!!!!Last I checked. ebay was the only one selling a used set.....did I really land myself the last new set ever made? Youd think multimedia sound technology would have advanced enough in these past 4 years to overtake the ingenuity of sound acoustics that go into the ACS 48 but no  forget klipsch. forget even bose for what they offer for mp3 audiophiles .or even altec lansings new ATP range..The original ACS 48. no longer available at stores or sold as a new set on the internet. is ladies and gentlemen the definitive 3 speaker system for your computer. Unfortunately. a lot of you shall be going to your grave having never heard these. Take my word for it  no other computer speakers on this planet offer clearer vocals at midrange or higher and there is not the slightest distortion at the highest volume .but youd burn out the tweeter in no time if u played ur ACS48 in the 12 o clock position all the time and u dont wanna do that coz ull never find a pair ever again.. For all you trance freaks who experience a chill run through your bodies when female vocals with synths in the background transport you to just another level of consciousness. belive me youll never find a better set to fuel your addiction... And if hard house is what you like. crank the sub a few notches up and youve got plaster peeling off the walls.And oh yeah..if God takes pity on you and drops you a set from heaven. make sure you have a top of the line soundcard because these speakers have an uncanny ability to expose chinks in anything less than the best.,5,1,2129

A24HMBKYHIESNJ,0,I bought a Nook Color after many rave reviews on CNET. First impression....fantastic! An ereader and so much more!After reading through the user manual there was a very small sentence that caught my eye. It said the Nook Color had a nonreplaceable battery. Thinking that is was only nonreplaceable by the user and that it could obviously be shipped back to the manufacturer for replacement..I called Bu0026N technical support. They told me that in fact the battery was nonreplaceable and I could buy their extended warranty if I wanted to cover the battery for an additional 2 years after the one year manufacturers warranty. If my battery died after the warranty period was up. I was told they would not replace the battery. Basically I would have to buy a new unit.I took it back to Barnes and Noble and explained that I was not willing to throw USD250.00 down the drain because they wouldnt replace the battery at any point in the future. The sales people had no idea. They were under the impression that the Nook could be sent back ay any time for a replacement battery. So. they can replace it only if its under warranty but they are unable to do it any other time? NOT! I wonder if anyone else is aware of this policy?,2,0,1224

A24PTVSZSM8968,0,These headphones have some nice features. They are a nice shape that fits comfortably on the head. They are a nice size that are fairly easy to carry around for nonlightweight headphones. They also have a very nice long cord that gives a lot of reach. The only issue I have is that they are a bit more quiet and less responsive than other headphones I have used that cost about the same. If you want a nice pair of headphones that are easy to carry around. its tough to beat these.,4,1,481
A24Q7Q677LMX4L,1,We bought the Olympus D340R for Christmas.  If this is your first digital camera purchase. as it was for us. you wont be disappointed. Ours came with an 8mb SmartMedia card which is plenty big enough for average picture  taking.  We also purchased the adapter to use at home to save on batteries.  In retrospect. I wish we had purchased the rechargeable batteries instead  and not had to deal with plugging in a cord. but the adapter works well.  I  cant tell the difference between the resolution on super high quality and  high quality.  They are both superb and as good as Ive seen on more  expensive cameras.  Download time is reasonable and not a problem.  We  reviewed many other cameras before settling on this one and just couldnt  find anything else that provided this kind of excellent quality for such a  reasonable price.,5,1,833

A24QUJ5PN6U3BN,23,After doing a lot of searching on line I decided to order this camera.Thanks to Amazons always excellent service the camera arrived just in time for a family trip I had planned.This left me with only a few hours  to learn what to do before using the camera for the first time. Though the  manual has 183 pages it takes about 3 minutes to learn how to do the  basics. Truly impressive. I went on my merry way and shot a whole bunch of  pictures. Upon returning home I installed the included software and  downloaded the pictures. One gripe regarding the software packageit would  be nice to have a u0026quotLiteu0026quot version of the instructions for use for  us novices. Im sure the help section has an answer to every question. but  all I want to do is the basics and this software has so many features it  gets to be a pain to find answers. I did get it working tho. and am truly  impressed with the quality of the pictures I took. I did not get the power  converter. but am planning to use rechargable batteries so the drain during  downloading is no issue. All in all I find this camera a pleasure to use  for a first time user like me. and Im sure if you bother to find out all  the features for just about anyone. All in all a great product!,5,1,1249
A24RD2OQXB1O4O,2223,The pages turn slowly on this nook.  I was unable to download a library book on it.  A microsoft person tried for some time to download a library book without success.  I believe that this was not a new nook as advertised. but a used faulty nook.  I returned it and was given a refund.  I bought a new nook glowlight from Barnes and Noble and it works very well.,1,0,362
A24SCH81NLQW9A,12,First let me qualify my comments.  If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative. buy another product!  Thats clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  Its not intended to surf the web. check email. etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that. in my opinion. it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight  much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI. which should be normal unless you are looking for another book. the battery doesnt need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I dont use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.  If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.  I think Barnes and Noble has a winner here.,5,1,1750
A24SCH81NLQW9A,46,I purchased this for my wife a week ago as an anniversary gift.  I already have a Nook ST and an IPAD2.  It was a very simple setup.  The colors are stunning and the build quality is excellent.  It is not as fast as my IPAD2 but its no slouch either.  The screen is very responsive to the touch.  The Nook Color is perfect for someone who is looking for a device that is optimized for ebooks yet allows email. websurfing. and video.  It even does flash which my IPAD2 doesnt.  I probably wont root it because for my wifes purposes it pretty much does everything she needs. but it can be rooted and used as a full fledged Android tablet.  I really like this device.  It is a little on the heavy side for an ereader but it is a great value for USD250. I would definitely recommend it to others.,4,1,792
A24SXAWMIOGYE,33,I love this converter. I have a bunch of seperate little converter plugs that are all loose and get lost in the suitcase when I travel. All the pieces here join together like a little puzzle so you dont worry about losing individual plugs.Since most electronics charge via USB these days the USB outlet is perfect for my iPhone. iPod and works for battery extenders etc. The USB charge LED is very useful. It comes on bright when charging with high current and dims as the device reaches full charge to off when fully charged. These were USD well spent.Edit. 8262010After extensive use with a long trip to 3 different countries I have discovered that while the USB charging circuit works well for nonintelligent devices it really caused the digitizer to act up on my iPhone 4 while it was plugged in. The iPhone was impossible to use while it was being charged by this device. It worked great charging the backup batteries I had. I just used the backup batteries to charge the iPhone 4.,5,1,986
A24TI4XO7EV7CN,55,Yaa I got this CD Player like 3 weeks ago and its not bad ... so this CD Player has a asowme 45 seconds ESP wich is averge since most CD Player have only 40 seconds ESP. The sound is great and the headphones a great but i would go with some earbuds I got that. I also like the fact that I can play CDRW in this CD Player. but the bad thing is it only has about 10 to 11 hours playback so get some rechargeable batteries I recommend NICD or NIMh batteries. Now you dont want to drope this CD Player or else the cover will break my friend CD Player did and so did mine but I got to exganged it. But over all this CD Player is great if your low on cash but if not go with a Panasonic...,4,1,683

A24UDQPNTOZDZV,0,Barnes and Noble is a company that is trying to hold on. but sees that it probably better grab what it can before it goes belly up. I have had problems with my Nook since day 1. and Barnes and Noble replaced my device with a refurbished that is worse than the original device. I would go back to handwritten manuscripts before purchasing another one of these things.,1,0,366
A24UM202P8OW38,3,After reading some negative reviews in various sites I was skeptical when buying this. I needed a casecover which would fit some kind of light so I can read on my Nook at night. This case does just that and more. Its not genuine leather or so. but still quite nice materials. it is nice to hold .especially when closed it fits the curvature of the original Nook very well while it is less perfect to hold when folded open. but still ok.. I was nicely surprised that the cover has some magnets inside at the bottom part .that are not visible in no way. so it shuts tight against the LCD when closed and hold quite well. The cover is not too bulky although it naturally adds some weight to your Nook because of the 2 AA batteries. On the inside it has a nice microfiber material which is of not too light color and it has a small  n  punched at the bottom left and decorated with a delicate glossy blue stripe  a nice touch of design.,5,1,932

A24UOBA83RVB8B,44,This was awful.  I could get no reception at all while in my car and live in an area where there are 3 interstate highways and 2 interstate beltways.  If I stepped away from a vehicle I could get periodic fragments of CB reception.  I even pulled off the road into a rest area and the reception was virtually nonexistent using the attached antenna.  Only when I used a trunk mounted more powerful antenna could I get a signal.  But then again. that defeats the purpose of having a portable handheld.,1,0,499
A24VQ2P3DS2V1K,15,I rated this one star out of aggravation of having to buy a new usb cable for this every couple of months. theyre built cheap. sold expensive and break extremely easy.  Ive spent  USD80 in usb cables already and other USB cables that have the same plug fitting dont work on the nook color. Its pretty sad when some off brand cable is built with more integrity then these cheap nook cables. Anyway the processor is slow and the navigation is horrible. The only thing that is great is the display. I wish that I wouldve just bought something of higher quality.,1,0,558

A24X7FE3TZLQSB,0,This Mini Microphone was a great purchase.  Its small enough to keep in a pocket or a change purse.  The sound quality is clear enough for a lecture or just daily reminders.

I hated it at first. but have  grown used to keeping my wrist muscles slightly tensed.  As a writer. I  dont use the pointer nearly as much as the keyboard. but I imagine that a  designer or other GUIintensive professional might find this problematic.

A25109W6AFK3X7,13,The Kodak Easyshare camera burns through batteries very quickly. except this one. the CRV3. With the others I could only take about 10 pictures before the batteries gave out. which is ridiculous! I suppose many of the lower priced digital snapshot cameras have this problem. I still dont cant take a lot of pictures before the battery drains. which is why I give it just 4 stars. but I can certainly get at least 3 or 4 dozen shots now. which is much better.This battery makes the camera possible to use. Without it the camera is nearly worthless.,4,1,547
A251LZC6NBUOA3,11,I have had my camera for 3 years now. I have been looking at the newer cameras and I am hesitant of buying a different one due to the unique Swivel head feature. You dont have to look through a view finder and you can change the angle and get a better picture without having to put your body in weird positions to see through the view finder.I have done photos of the kids and they came out just as good as if I went to Sears or any of those other photo places. I chose the 1680 resolution and this gives me a very clear 8x10 image. I can use the software and shrink this down smaller to get a more crisp image. I can also select the 1280 for a great 5x7 or the 307 for pics to upload onto the web without having to resize them.  I tried a newer camera by Kodak and I didnt like the fact that although it is newer. the images form this camera are much crisper than the one from the 2.2 megapixel one.I rated 4 stars because I didnt get a usb Port cable with it when I bought it and now I havent found any to fit the unique jack to the camera. I solved this by using a film reader. I ended up doing this as the cable that came with the camera wasnt uploading the images onto the computer and I didnt want to buy another camera and I didnt want to pay abunch of money to repair it when the film reader was USD. I now use the camera as before but instead of connecting to the computer to upload. I just insert the memory card into the reader and this is MUCH faster than waiting for the camera to upload the images into photowise.I think the photo quality is much better than most of the other cameras I see out there..at least in the USDUSDUSDUSDUSD range. I use it mostly for ebay and have to say the only other thing that I dont like is the flash is really bright..I often have reflected light off my books but I just change the angle of the camera or add a light in the background to off shoot it.All in all I like that this is heavier and larger than the other cameras out there. The Kodak I was messing with felt so light and flimsy I sometimes forgot I was holding it! I like the swivel feature on this camera but wish some of the newer ones had this as well. The only thing that is a drawback is the time it takes to process each image after taking the photo and the time it takes to upload...takes forever. I did notice the newer ones are quicker but like I said I dont want to spend another USD500 on a camera...so if you are looking for something to get second hand to play with I suggest this model..there are some on ebay and are around USD170USD220 which isnt a bad price for the quality images you get. I have a 4Mb memory card it came with and that drawback is it will only hold 67 images using the 1680 resolution. I think you can still get a larger memory card but I havent gotten around to doing it. So all in all I am pleased with this camera even though I cant get it to upload the images onto the computer..thank goodness for film readers!,4,1,2958
A252JKTV1Q5XKQ,22,Over all Id say this is a good detector. I have had it about a month now. and it has saved me at least twice.  It does false some but less than my last radar detector .whister..  I have had it pick up cops on all bands. except laser.  I picked up a Columbus cop using Ka band about 34 of a mile away.  I picked up a Lancaster cop that was behind me about a 12 mile using X band.  And I frequently pick up Franklin county sheriffs. using K band.Most of the falses I get are X band from automatic doors. I do get some Ka falses. I think that come from other radar detectors in passing cars. but they are not usually full strength.I did have one encounter where State of Ohio highway patrol was using Ka band and my detector did not go off until I passed him. I think this was because he was looking for people driving fast and was just turning his radar on when he saw these fast drivers.In my area they do not use the safety warning or VG2 so I leave these functions off.If you have your radio up and your windows down. then sometimes it is hard to here the detector.I would recommend this for anyone looking for a midpriced radar detector.,4,1,1139

A256F7E787F5SG,11,In recent years. no other portable shortwave radio has rated quite as high on the u0026quotneatou0026quot scale as the Grundig G2000A. This Grundigs two best design features are its Porschedesigned cosmetics and its handy leather carrying u0026quotcase.u0026quot These things alone are cool enough to inspire almost any shortwave listener to want one and have fun using it.The radios performance isnt quite as great as its beauty. however. For its small size. it performs fine with an external antenna. but less well with the aerial. Its sensitivity is decent. and selectivity is passable. But dont expect a listening experience on par with rivals within its price class .USD100USD150.. Bottom line is. youre paying more for the looks than anything else. If performance is what you desire. keep looking.I give it less than four stars for several reasons. First. it fails to cover the entire shortwave spectrum from 1600 khz to 30 mhz. Thats a big drawback among todays digital radios. Second. the keypad is awkward to use. even though it looks fabulous. Third. the software provides a measly 10 memory positions for shortwave. which is okay if you only listen to the major broadcasters.Nevertheless. the G2000A is an aesthetically nice radio thats fun to operate for casual listening. For a novice listener. Id recommend something simpler. If youre a more serious. demanding listener. you probably already have something else. I enjoy using it because it reminds me of my dads old Zenith Royal 500E. which has a great leather case. I like this Grundig. but Im glad it isnt my only one.,3,0,1585
A256GE7AQ65VWF,7070,First off. I used this unit in place of a set of amplified PC speakers... for that it works great... MP3s and Cds play just fine. The unit has a decent executive look to it and looks fine on my desk at work.  For USD90 you cant really complain. One hitch. it does pick up ambient RF noise .IE cell phones and such sound like pops from the speakers occaisionally. but I was ableto live with it .and it could be problems in my building anyway..For those of you who are lamenting about the lack of Bose or Bu0026O quality from this little thing. quit crying... Fisher hasnt made audiophilequality stuff for years.  What do you want from a USD90 unit ?  This thing was perfectly fine. and cheap.  The LINE inputs are really a valueadded for me.,4,1,740

A25C67UM2JLQIZ,12,I was a bit apprehensive before buying this product due to a few reviews I had read in these columns. however I decided to take the risk because of a low budget and I have no regrets.

A25D7KKZFL2PH0,12,The convenience of floppy disks is hard to beat. No proprietary cables or special setup is required.

Almost any computer can  read the formatstandard JPEG used by the Mavica cameras. You can even dupe  a disk in the middle of nowhere. Try that with a smart card! If you want to  make a living with artful photography look higher up the line. or at the  Olympus 600. If you want to make a living on eBay. or just have fun with  your camera. its hard to beat the Mavica for convenience and versatility.,4,1,742

A25H0833HIW3NX,0,Within 3 months of using the FL8550 the turntable refused to switch CDs in random mode and sometimes would not even sense the existence of a single CD when loaded.  Even when performing normally. it makes a loud irritating  sound when switching between disks.  When I took it in for warranty repair.  I found that about 80% of the pieces brought into the shop for repairs were  the HK 8550 and 8350.  The technician told me that the sensor used in the  model is too delicate and is the cause of frequent problems.  The HDCD  sound difference was certainly not u0026quotaudibleu0026quot to my ear.

Although  phillips is no longer servicing or supporting Nino. their website still has  excellent resources available.  Tip.

A25Q8TM5NF6PZN,0,Its a good reader. I own both original Nook and this. I use this only for reading books .no annotation. markup. Web browsing. etc...Good. lightweight. long battery life. good contrast. quick display refresh.Bad. hardware buttons. accidental page turns. must have Bu0026N account.Good hardware buttons are a MUST. and the original Nooks win. These buttons require more force. and thats if you press the center of the button. Good luck if you press either the top or the bottom portion of the button. In short. feeling the ridge beneath your thumb and pressing doesnt mean the page will turn.I often accidentally tap the screen slightly while reading. and it causes a page turn. There is no option to disable the touch screen while reading.I was required to connect the Nook to a Bu0026N account on setup. I get my books elsewhere and dont have a desire to hook up with Bu0026N online right now. Blah.Overall. improved over original Nook in many ways. Very quick. Touch screen can be nice.

A25QY9B9W2FQCF,33,First time I plugged it in and installed the drivers it worked instantly. Captured about four hours worth of high quality video with no sync problems on a P3450 with 128megs ram.I then installed a USB cd writer. The  Dazzle device no longer works. I really dont care what installing the cd  writer did. I see this as a major flaw. My USB cd writer and USB zip drive  work perfectly. Im now forced to use this device on another. much slower  computer. Nothing about this is mentioned on their site.This product is  VERY flakey. After making changes to video settings. you must exit the  program. unplug the device. plug it back in. and restart the capture  program. This seems to be Dazzles solution for every problem Ive  encountered with this piece of uhm.. plastic.It feels as if this product  was rushed out in a u0026quotjust make it worku0026quot strategy. Dazzle  obviously did not test this product thoroughly enough before finalizing  it.Stay away. Get a digital camcorder and DV card instead.,2,0,1001
A25R01FKKZ96UI,3336,I bought a pair of these to go with my DVD player and I have never been disappointed.  I use a realtively cheap AIWA receiver. and I get fantastic sound quality from movies and music.  Heck. even watching broadcast TV and my hifi VCR produce stunning sound.  Ive never heard any distortion coming from the speakers. and Ive played some funky CDs with extremely  low and high frequencies.  However. I live in a 1 bedroom apartment and I  do not play it at very high levels for long periods of time.  They can get  extremely loud and the bass is VERY deep. no need for a subwoofer that I  can see.  5 stars for the speakers. 3 stars for the amazon.com price.  Still a good deal for this kind of sound quality!,5,1,707
A25R01FKKZ96UI,2527,Ive had this DVD player for about 9 months now  Ive played over fifty DVDs .purchased and rented. and havent had one that wouldnt play yet.  Ive also used it as a fulltime CD player. God knows how many CDs its played .perfectly. I might add..  The only problem Ive had is that it does  freeze up for a second sometimes and then continues.  I assumed this was  because it was changing layers.  I took off a star for it but its really  no big deal and only happens on a few movies.  Id expect for from it if it  was a u0026quotflagshipu0026quot model but its not priced that way. and for the  price I feel its a good deal.,4,1,620
A25RWGRTI45P88,0,I was so excited by the price...the one i wanted at walmart was USD159 dollars.  Once I recieved this one. i could see a big difference from the one I was considering.  It doesnt move fluidly at all...the instructions even say put it where you want it and tighten the screws.  I wanted one the could tilt out to watch in from bed them push back against the wall.  If that is what you what...DONT GET THIS ONE.  It seems unsturdy stretched all the way out with a 32in tv also.If you are like me. and dont want to shell out a lot of money. this one will be fine to mount . push it back against the wall. tighten screws and leave it.  Even the screen tilt scfrew.  Also. if mounting a bigger tv....all the screws are really close together and its a lot of weight in one spot.  It seems solid for now...but I haved got complete faith in it.Overall great for the price if you want to mount it and leave it.  If you want one to constant move around...you gotta spend some bucks.,3,0,972

A25ZAA15CP30HZ,22,It managed to read a total of one disk before breaking.When I plugged it in it was detected just fine. However after copying the data off of one disk and inserting another disk the device claimed that the disk was not formatted. After a few checks I decided to take its word for it. but when I went to eject this disk the device refused to let the disk go. The disk was stuck in the floppy disk reader.After I press the eject button a few times I decide that the device will never let go unless I force it to do so. I take my screwdriver and undo the one screw that holds the devices case on. I then press the eject button to find that the disk ejects just fine. At this point I was wondering how this happened. So I put the device back together and I put another disk back into the device. This time the disk is read just fine however when I go to eject the disk the device again refuses to do so. After freeing about 10 disks of which only 3 were read I get tired of the disk drives attitude.When I buy a disk drive I expect to be able to remove the disk when I am done. In addition the device feels .though I must admit that it was. cheap. 310 disks read wouldnt be so bad if my other machine also couldnt read them. but it could so that can also be attributed to the disk drive.But hey. if you are willing to put up with having to remove the case to eject the disk and only having 310ths of them read then this is a good device for the price.,1,0,1446
A25ZSSWN6R2FY6,11,Cassette section failed within first year. Tapes autoreverse and autostop randomly. Tape counter inconsistent.It takes a looong time for CDs to be recognized.CD controls are insensitive. They need a good solid click to activate.CD audio plays through the tape outputs. as well as the CD outputs.Wish Id avoided this one and bought separate units.,2,0,346
A260Q3ERHSDV0H,11,Ive used the Garmin 12 for the last 4 years in the desert of Northwest Kenya.  It has endured the sand. heat. sun and abuse I expose it to.  Ive never even bought a case for it!

DO NOT purchase ebooks from Bu0026N as they contain additional security restrictions that make it extremely difficult  not possible to compile into Adobe Digital Edition for transfer to other ereader devices.

A263VLZB2OD9ZV,69,I try to order from Mediabridge when possible because they seem to know how to package and deliver cables that work out of the box. no fancy packaging. no rocket science. no need to hang a cable for a week to work out the kinks. just a sound cable.,4,1,248
A263XQ5MBV1OS3,0,But. not worth not much more than 7 dollars. Hard to believe Grundig would put their name on something with a tuner that is this AWFUL. They make a solid case. put 3 speakers in it...and the tuner is worse than my clock radiolocal radio stations are even fuzzy. nonexistent at night. You can bet I will never buy Grundig ANYTHING ever again. People actually pay 150200 dollars for this radio. Unreal.Lare,2,0,404
A265E06US2OAF0,23,I dont own this specific APC product. but I do own other APC products.My home was hit by lightning on July 2. 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC.NET3 surge protectors offer the best .USD50.000. damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination. the surge protectors are functioning properly .I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs..I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike. but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs.I now do not recommend APC equipment. since their warranty is worthless.The TRUE test of a product is whether or not the company will stand behind the product when a problem occurs. and APC has totally failed in this matter.,1,0,1019

A265MKAR2WEH3Y,1315,This unit is a fantastic aide for truckers. Many great features that make it useful. Accuracy does not always seem to be current. At times it takes you many miles out of the way to get to where you are going. Also the graphics are very jerky. They could be a lot smoother. Very informative. but could be a lot smoother. Also. it does not zoom in like it should when exiting or turning.,4,1,385
A26624KSJ3FBMZ,11,It does what is says it does. the only downside I can think of is. that it does not have an eject button for the CF Card. so when the card fits tight. you have to remove the PCMCIA Card to actually get the CF card out.,4,1,218
A266RU00QZHTRE,33,I own a Samsung Smooth U350 phone from Verizon Wireless. and it does not utilize MicroSD cards at all. It doesnt use any form of SD card. The language of the description for this product needs to be altered...an unsuspecting buyer will be disappointed when his or her new card cannot be inserted or used in any way by his or her Samsung Smooth phone.Im sure the MicroSD card advertised here works perfectly well. but it simply will not work with a Samsung Smooth phone.

A26BWTO1I7BI1H,34,My mothers radio finally went after about 40 years of excellent service.  She only listens to WOR  AM radio.  I purchased 3 radios for her .at different times. and NONE of them received AM. although their papers said they would.  Finally found this one on Amazon and then had to debate whether to accept the positive or negative reviews online.  Decided to order it and it does work. despite some rare static.  Happy with this radio. as is she.,4,1,444
A26DC9SJPENT8N,56,Works fine. my computer recognizes it as a Toshiba DVD .dont know if it is or just triggers that driver.. Doesnt drain the battery excessively.

A26DOGBEOIO5IE,0,For the price. you cant complain a lot. I received these along with a Yamaha Electric Grand piano and the purpose was to be able to use it with the keyboard without disturbing others. The headphones are suitable for that. Dont spend ten pancakes and expect to have an audiophile experience with these.I plugged them into my iPod. and at moderatenormal listening volume I was listening to Beck  Sea Change. I could barely hear the bass and drums on this album. There must be a huge rolloff under 100 Hz on these. because while it says 2020.000Hz they arent telling you that its probably +10db.  .Highs and midrange frequencies are fine. I suppose if youre listening to music where low frequencies arent prevalent. then you will be fine with these. aka. an electronic keyboard. baroque. horns and strings. you may find these adequate when youre on an extreme budget. Not sure if they need a little breaking in before the bass comes. but Im really not counting on it. Even when playing through a more powerful external amp. the bass was still very weak.Turning the volume up to see if I could hear the lows just made the midrange and highs louder and the headphones distorted the sound terribly. even through the external amp.,3,0,1223

A26FYKG5LAHRUH,0,. STOP!!! . 1 This camera is NOT 640x480. is a fixed 320x240. CCD is not  even 13 megapixel. is 110 I think. Images are bad .like enlarging a  thumbnail?. Print them in an 1x1 inch rectangle and theyll be somehow  fine. anything bigger is like old CGA... awful. When you take shots they  look very bad. whatever you do to  edit .software. and fix them. I have  another .true. 640x480 camera and pictures are excelent. but these...2  It doesnt include an AC adapter. so be prepared to buy LOTS of AA  batteries or spend another 50 bucks.3 Fine as a serial videoconference  camera .30 fps.. but watch for the batteries.4 Take your first picture.  and begin to wonder if its ok. The lack of an LCD screen begins to bother  you when you find out you cant review your shots. Think about it. you wont  review your pictures untill you get to the PC.Sorry I am very  disappointed.,1,0,872
A26G8GQA6XLT7G,1617,Looks nice and I am a big fan of Moleskine products... however. am I the only one that thinks that doesnt make sense for righthanded people?Imagine that you are reading this on a planetraincar .passenger of course.. I typically hold books with my left hand and flip pages or write with my right so lets go with that. Do you really want to cross your line of vision to jot down notes? Even if you lay it down on the desk. you would still find it difficult to write as you read.I thought about folding it back all the way so the notebook is in back of the Kindle and that makes even less sense because then you would have to completely take your eyes away from the screen. No matter how you think about it. this setup is cumbersome.As an improvement. I would allow the user to choose a lefthanded or right handed version. Or the product could be made modular and the user could decide where the Kindle and notepad should go. There could be fasteners for either on both sides or allow the user to flip the cover over... though that could lead to problems with the elastic band but hey. I didnt say I had the answer.,3,0,1112

A26HZCFEYIGG8V,0,Weve had these radios in subzero temperatures while skiing. hiking through the u0026quotcanyonsu0026quot of Venice. Italy. and everywhere in between.

A26IQ71XV0AZ1D,11,Many people like to criticize the Rio 300 .and the newer model.the 600. because it only comes with 32MB of memory.  While thiscriticism is valid. Id like to point out that the Rio 300 .and other 32MB players. are considerably CHEAPER than their newer 64MB siblings. ...Think about it. folks. ...  A 32MB SmartCard. if you search around online. only costs about .30% of a 64 MB player..  If youre that upset about the skimpy memory on the Rio 300. simply shell out the extra sixty bucks and youll still have saved yourself fiftyplus dollars.As for memory. you can gain more music space on your player if you DONT transfer songs at high bit rates.  For example. I typically transfer my songs .from an origianl CD. at 112 kps .CD quality. and sometimes at 96kps .near CDquality. and believe me you cant tell the difference..  In short. I love my Rio 300 and will soon buy extra memory for it and still have money left over in my pocket.,4,1,933

A26MS2SFZXPGKC,2,the sound quality to the earphones is horrible ..i have a pairof earphones i bought at the dollar bill store that work alot better....i sent them back the same day i received them ...i even tested them with my 7 year old .because i couldnt figure out why these great looking headphones had such poor quality i gave him the dollar bill store ones and the labtech ones put on a kids mp3 and asked him which sounded better he replied the dollar ones were much better and said daddy these suck..the stereo quality was like listening to a record album...and i did try all different media types on it games mp3s dvd and a slayer cd all still had the same crappy quality....now the mic did work good but the sound cancelling was subpar....save your money !!!!!,1,0,753

A26PQD51JG0H8T,77,I LOVED this tripod right when I got it. Its lightweight. comes with a case and a level and was pretty stable. Then one day while i was tightening one of the screws it stripped the plastic and now wont tighten anymore. I could deal with it because it was one i didnt tighten often. But then today. the main long handle that you use to change the angle of the camera stripped too!! I dont tighten it really tight. but i tighten it pretty often because i change the angle I shoot at a lot. This is an important screw. To just strip so easily... I was really disappointed. Im going to send my tripod back with the ten year warranty and see what happens.Im not sure if other people have had this problem or if its just my use. Besides this incident. the tripod has been wonderful.,2,0,776

A26RFZPOMMDQEV,15,I bought this swhw combo about a month ago and just finished my third  project. I think this is fantastic software for the price. My first project  was a 55 min movie with over 250 scenes. with a transition between nearly  every scene. lots of titles. scanned graphics. etc. The resulting movie was  nearly perfect. a little jitter and a couple of artifacts in transitions.  probably mostly due to disk drive performance. The software is very easy to  use with almost every feature that I could want. The software did crash  occasionally but. with the automatic autosave. I never lost more than 30  seconds or so of work.  Amazing software for the price!,5,1,654

No place to store a writing utensil Wont fit standard Moleskine reporter books. even the soft cover ones .too rigid backing. too thick.

A26YO5A2Y8EBEG,11,This works perfect for hooking up my phone to my old tape player in the car. The cord is probably 4 feet so plenty of room to move and it seems to be quality.

A26ZNIE5BZV01H,11,These headphones were a terrible disappointment!!  I cant help but think that they are defective since they are nothing like previous excellent experiences Ive had with JVC products in the past.  I still have and use JVC Model HAW100RF 900 MHz wireless headphones which has been a wonderful product for almost a decade Im able to go outdoors and mow the lawn while listening to TV news with the older set.  But these new ones. which are supposed to have a range 3 times further than the old ones. are almost impossible to tune and have a range of less than 20 feet they are also a very loose fit. not snug to the head and ears as are the older ones.  I complained to JVC. which resulted in a canned response to the effect that their guarantee only covers replacement parts if Ill send the headphones into a service center.  If you can get a set that works as advertised. theyre a wonderful product .yes. you SHOULD be able to listen to your TV or stereo. very clearly. while mowing the back of your yard if the set works. but if you have the same experience I did. then shame on JVC for not living up to their own standards.  Mine are a piece of junk!!,1,0,1152
A26ZO8ZHA4E00F,1415,I bought this camera mainly for its small size and ease of use.  I spent hours comparing and I am very pleased with my final choice.

A270WF8P2GCO58,1718,The quality of this cable if pathetic.DSLRs are made to be more portable than other cameras when filming. so I expect this cable to be able to take somewhat of beating since the camera isnt locked down on a tripod all day. The Mini HDMI portion is very flimsy and is not reinforced in any way.This cable died on my in the middle of my very first shoot with it. so I had to have a PA run to Best Buy and get me another one. which set me back about USD50 but at least it lasted me a pretty long time.Dont waste your money.,1,0,520

A272UUE0JB4IGH,1,I switched to this Nook from the original model I bought years ago because I wanted to be able to read in the dark.  Its so much lighter and more compact than older models. and its convenient and easy on the eyes to read with the light on.  My only complaint is that the touch screen is almost comically sensitivemy sleeve. my scarf. or even my hair touching the screen activates the highlighting feature on the screen.  That part is annoying. but overall Im thrilled with this Nook and. if the old model is any indication. it should work well for years to come.,4,1,562
A273U6RA2OT6NK,12,The screen is excellent in both dim light and bright sun. While I have lots of books. they are not all epub or pdf format.

A276Y3XWRGW747,22,This table top power strip was perfect for our conference room and the long cord was a plus.

A279COY1U62AJZ,0,I really like the Nook Simple Touch and the way it displays ebooks. The problem for me has been fairly consistent problems with functionality. The firmware on the device as delivered didnt work at all. It was appalling that a brand new factory versions touch screen did not accurately respond to where I touched. It took days of trying to connect to wifi because of this. I immediately installed the firmware update. and that seemed to work. But it still gets unresponsive often. reverts back to the homescreen or settings panel in the middle of reading.Thus. this device. which is not accepted for return by the seller I bought it from. is infuriating and largely unused. I keep looking for a new firmware update to finally solve this issue. but I doubt Bu0026N will have any forthcoming.Update. I think the problem I described above is a flaw with my own device and not about firmware. I have since purchased a Kindle and I couldnt be happier with it.,2,0,953

A27AKA4S2AS747,22,I wore these for about an hour while riding the bus and couldnt wait to take them off. Maybe if I could find a way to replace the minimal amount of padding around the ears they would be better. but I doubt if I can.  The headband felt fine.They did reduce the background noise to some extent. but it was still noticeable on the bus.  Actually. my ipod headphones were louder than the Sonys with the ipod set at the same volume. but the sonys seem to be a little easier on my eardrums due to the fact that their not jammed in my ear canal.Im considering returning these and getting the Bose QuietComfort 2. Although USD300 for a pair of headphones is obscene. I need something good for long flights and Im not sure that these will do the trick.These headphones suck without the noise reduction turned on.  With it on the sound is better. although somewhat muddy compared to the headphones that came with my ipod. I suppose I would rather wear these on a plane. bus. or train than my ipod headphones because they are easier on my eardrums. while still allowing me to hear the words of the music Im listening to.As you can see they look great and they fold up nicely too.  I wish they would just make them more comfortable.,2,0,1220

A27B2NA4IKY3P8,0,Easy to installEasy to use and adjustAllows for multiple viewing angles. so were able to watch from multiple rooms.4 stars because I did have to go buy longer screws to mount the TV to the bracket. but overall a Great Value!!,4,1,225
A27C7DC80E4US8,0,I used this plug to connect an old IBM keyboard into my keyboard. but when I did. it froze the whole computer. I tried several times and it was the same thing every time. Maybe Im just doing something wrong. Regardless. its hard to complain. The product was inexpensive and it was sort of crazy to think a keyboard as old as the one I tried using would work. If youre absolutely desperate to use an old keyboard or dont mind spending a few bucks to experiment. you might as well try. There wasnt any permanent damage to my computer as far as I can tell so why not?,1,0,564

A27DHWJ275D678,1,I bought the 32 gig. card for just that purpose. My Samsung phone. takes as good pictures as most cameras. In fact I like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s4. I would buy it again and again if I needed a lot of memory. I recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera. I like to take moving photos with my Samsung. and those 8 second runs take a lot of memory. now I dont have to worry and running out of memory,4,1,538
A27E50PUMWUSXY,34,I was going to buy a 50 pack for the same price but I thought that these were going to be better quality and they were supposedly 8 inches. I was wrong on both points. Theyre actually only 7 inches which makes a difference if the other option .50 pack. are 6 inches that Im comparing to. Also velcro quality is only average which was another criticism of the 50 pack ones. For the price Id just go with the 30 or 50 pack.,3,0,421
A27ESR4RQAVAAQ,0,Ive had my Voodoo 3 3000 AGP for more than a year now. and Im very satisfied with it.Right now its overklocked from 166 to 190Mhz. and it runs just great. especially when playing games at 800x600. it just  screams.Its compatibility is impressing. Its very rare to see a game  created after 1998 that wont work with the Voodoo3. Doesnt matter if its  glide. OpenGL or Direct3D. The drivers are updated every once in a while  and are well written.The pricetag on this baby is a happy sight for a  lot of wannabegamers that cant afford to cough up over USD250 for a  graphics card.If youre on a tight budget and want excellent performance  at resolutions up to 1024x728. you cant go wrong here.This could be to  3Dfx what the Volvo Amazon was to Volvo...people are so satisfied with it  that they didnt want toneed to upgrade.,5,1,823
A27F116JS2VGSA,22,It seems there is a trend here.  I also loved my Panasonic player until it melted down  just like the others in these reviews.The repair guy says he can order a new board .as the chips arent replaceable. for USD150   total repair price over USD200.I bought it exactly 13 months ago  so  much for a one year warranty.  Panasonic wont admit to any problem with  these chips and wont repair it under warranty.If this many machines are  going bad with exactly the same symptons .pixelization. sound cutting in  and out. then locking up.. shoudnt Panasonic step up and recall them or at  least honor the warranty one month over the date?I am buying a Sony  and will never buy Panasonic again.,1,0,687

A27F40FECNJI44,0,I dont really have anything to add to the praise heaped on this mouse. but I would say that a few days after I bought this .about 6  years ago.. I thought I had wasted my money my hand and forearm  began aching quite severely whenever I used it. and I ended up disconnecting it and putting it one side. Out of a desire not to waste 50 I tried it again a few weeks later and for some reason my handarm seemed to have adjusted and Ive had no problems since. I notice that theres three negative reviews of this mouse on this website and two of them are because of it being painful to use. Maybe this is why Logitech stopped making it? Its the only reason Ive given it 4 stars instead of 5. and its definitely something to take into account if youre thinking of buying one. but it says a lot about the quality of this mouse that it would now cost me more to replace it .with a secondhand one. than it did to buy new in the first place. Its the only bit of computer kit Ive bought thats increased in value over the years!,4,1,1016

A27I84GCCHTWAK,0,These lightweight headphones give a rich. full sound that handle high volume well. The ear pads are a bit larger than is common. but you can really hear the difference this size makes. The two features I absolutely  love .since I use this with my computer. is the EXTRALONG .8 foot. cord  and the volume control. I am constantly moving around my desk and the cord  gives me an excellent level of freedom. And. with the volume control. I can  quickly mute the phones to have conversations with others.,4,1,500
A27K5RT7VDB7BU,99,I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV.  Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount .less than 55lbs.. but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV. the sagging shouldnt be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall. for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.,3,0,955
A27K80SBJQQQDS,7092,Did not resolve the issue with my car dvd drive.  When I put it in the drive ejected it as it did with dvds.I beleive it is ok. Just havent tried it in any other dvd drives I have.,4,1,180
A27KB14NKE5IY0,1,If youre looking for a radio that will pick up stations like the quality radios from 30+ years ago .Im 39.. then you need look no farther. Tired of having to move radios in unusual positions .draping power cords. etc. in order to get my Cardinals baseball games in clearly. I decided to try to find a radio like the one my father had many years ago. I was somewhat concerned about the GE brand name as many of the items I have purchased within the last several years form GE have been substandard. NOT WITH THE SUPERADIO III!The sound is good. The midrange is very flat and clear. It picks up most stations I seek even with the FM antenna down. My other radios cant even pull them at all. AM is exceptional. I live near high power transmission lines. and it doesnt phase it a bit.GE could have put in a digtal tuner. or a weighted flywheel for tuning. Also they could have used better feeling controls and a more substantial case. BUT. this would have dramatically changed its price range and not have improved performance much.Overall it is an exceptional value!!This may be the last product with the GE name that actually performs to the level of quality that GE was once known for.,5,1,1184
A27KUFA1ZWICAO,4748,After comparing sound quality in many computer speaker systems at an electronic retail store. I purchased the Cambridge Sound Works 100PC system. In the price range that I was considering. these speakers actually  sounded as good as the more expensive Yamaha speakers and only slightly  less powerful than the much more expensive Altec Lansing system.  At  home the CSW100PC performs even better than in the store where accustics  leave much to be desired. Disappointed I am NOT in these little  beauties.The Subwoofer provides ample power and limited distortion at all  but the highest levels. and the matching of Subwoofer to sattelite speakers  is flawless in my environment. I placed the subwoofer on a stand up off the  floor to limit vibration and distortion.  In my opinion. the CSW100PC  cant be beat by anything in its price range. and by most in a higher  price range.  **** Its a keeper.****,4,1,902
A27L4AAHAD2T92,2930,I purchased a nook a few months ago for my father. After having it less than two months the nook reset itself and failed. We called customer service and they sent out a replacement. After about two weeks. the nook began to freeze. an occurrence that has become more and more frequent. About a week ago. the device got stuck on the loading screen and required pulling the battery for an hour and then fully charging.Though the nook is currently working. my dad is scared to rely on it.  I bought the nook for him as he travels often. After having it freeze on a long flight. hes begun carrying a paperback just in case. defeating the purpose of the gift.Stay away from this product. Its complete garbage. The interface is frustrating. and its completely unreliable.,1,0,764
A27M9QONAD5CD1,12,Tape worked well   no problem.  Its hard to find VHS tapes. so I was pleased. And they arrived promptly.,4,1,104
A27MRRJBCZZ5QA,0,Ive had these speakers for about 6 months now and I am extremely suprised at the great sound quality from them.  It does lack some in the bass.  It only hits 80Htz.  But they still sound great.  I was using a reciever with the bass boost centered at 45 htz.  How useful on speakers that wont hit that low!  But I got a good pioneer thats centered at 100htz. and they sound way better.  Very clear sound no matter how loud they are.  Tweeter sounds good. but there is some whine in the higher bass. but for running them to the max what do you expect?  Im running 100 watts per channel through these. and theyll handle it very well. especially for the size.  I did blow one of the woofers last week from having them up way too high when it went from a vocal song to a bassier song. but when taking the woofer out. I noticed it was a quality speaker with 60 watts max. vented pole piece. and a good magnet structure.All in all I think these speakers are comparable to way more expensive speakers in everything but deep bass.  But I have the KLH 10u0026quot 120 watt sub and they are a perfect match.  Despite what people say about KLH Im suprised with the quality of their products.  Most of the bad reviews are due to operator error.  And what do you expect from USD50 bookshelfs?  Deep bass to crack a window?  They wont shake the walls. but use it with a sub and theyll sound awesome.  Worth every penny and would happily buy another pair for whatever.,5,1,1452
A27NJ8C8OUC309,33,I purchased this CB radio at a local electronics store for USD...... It comes with an adapter to plug into your vehicle. The adapter also has a hookup for an external antenna. You can use the unit as a hand held with the battery packs. The radio comes with two battery holders. One for disposable batteries. another for rechargeable. The rechargeable battery holder has an AC adapter included. It comes with a steel belt clip. Though. be careful it can easily scratch your belt.The radio isnt very loud. even with the sound at max level. The only time I have any issues hearing it is when I have a window cracked. It does come with a jack for headphones or an external speaker. This Midland model also does not have an ANL .Automatic Noise Limiter.. and does receive interference from time to time.The range is to be expected for a hand held radio. Using it with the rubber antenna inside of your vehicle you can expect 14  34 mile range depending on the time of day and terrain. You get better range outside of your vehicle. Excellent for use on ATVs. If you plan to use this radio in your vehicle. it would be wise to purchase an antenna. I purchased a magnetic antenna for portability. .....,4,1,1194

A27OYDKY7HXL88,0,Way overpriced. way underuseful.  I would give it NO stars. but that doesnt seem to be an option.  In the past few decades that this card has been available .only a slight exageration. there have been great improvements made that this old piece doesnt have.  You want to get a different card unless you have no desire to play any sounds besides MIDI files.,1,0,356
A27PDITYCWF151,67,The batteries and charger work fine. The problem is that the OD of the battery is slightly larger than regular CR123As.

A27POUEZJP2IDM,2224,Got this for my Garmin nuvi. I understand the original use of card was for portable devices. Nevertheless. it is too small and easy to lose.

Clunky design overall.,3,0,335
A27R1FLUS2KTIX,1,This is a great camera for the money. It has a relatively small color LCD screen and a black u0026amp white viewfinder. but those are the only drawbacks.

A27RWL29AZE08A,45,This is my second Propad Gamepad. and it will be my last.  Anytime I want to use it. I have to calibrate it every time.  Thats a nuisance. but not the only problem.  If I dont calibrate it. and want to play a computer game that can be played with either keyboards or gamepads. the game always gets screwed up.  One of the buttons doesnt do anything at all .and. according to my game. Fifa 99. the button should pass the soccer ball.. and two others are switched.  The only thing that works properly is the DPad.  Basically. this is a piece of crap.  I can use it. but only when I have to .for playing 2 player games..  The price is really cheap and you get what you pay for.  A really cheap. piece of crap.,2,0,706
A27S55KYD5LCAT,34,i bought this because when i do my volunteer work it is extremely hard to hear. so with this one i could hear everything that goes over the radio. THIS IS A 1 PIN REMOTE SPEAKER. YOUR RADIO NEEDS TO HAVE A SLOT FOR 1 PIN TO USE THIS.pro.built nicelyable to have the radio on low and still be able to hear everything .keep in mind of the noise around you.push to talk built inconi use a safety pin so i could attach it my uniform better. may pull the clothes down a bit .need to break in the wires has to be looser. this is something smallthis does have a clip on the back of the speakers but i dont like to use it.overallprice cheaper now compared to when it first name came out .about USD15 less.sound goodjust overall its very good.i would recommend this.,5,1,757

A27S7J7HZA4ESL,22,I connected the drive to a Win 8 machine. and it was immediately recognized and drive installed automatically.  I put a diskette in that I had data on from about 10 years ago. and the drive did not recognize it.  I tried another diskette and it also was not recognized.  Third try on the first diskette was a winner.  I was able to read and write to the diskette.  I tried about 8 other diskettes and all were successful.  I have about 200 diskettes that contain data and older applications that I plan to check out.BTW  If you ever wondered how these were named  floppy . even though the case of the diskette is hard. the actual recording media inside is a flexible film material similar to the material in the very old 5 14  real  floppies .,4,1,743
A27SU24SXEDIPM,0,Nice AM reception.  FM is surprisingly poor.  The building Im in makes it difficult. but my old el cheapo radio had better FM.  So for me bottom line. great for AM. so so for FM.,2,0,178

A27U0CLB8ZMRVP,35,...because they suck. I bought these when I was walking to work one day at the drug store. I got ripped off and paid USD4.99. Here is why they suck.1. They are uncomfortable in my ear. No soft rubber. just hard plastic. Not even really molded to fit in an ear.2. The plug was shorting out from the second I plugged it in. It requires much twisting and bending to get sound out of it.3. Since they dont fit well in the average ear. the sound quality ends up sounding super tinny. I found that if you reverse the left and right earpieces and twist them in a 45 degree angle to the front. they sound OK. Its not comfortable and you cant wear it like that for more than 10 minutes.4. They are white. like every other earbuds available on the market today. I wasnt plugging these into an IPod. but now I look all the yuppies on the bus out of suburbia with their white wires going into their ears. The yuppies are going to start thinking that I am one of them and try to trade rare Phish bootlegs with me.I am going to go back to using my gigantic Optimus headcans. They look silly but sound better. In the time I spent writing this review. I could have panhandled enough cash to get better headphones. Maybe I should stop being a cheapskate and drop some money on better headphones.Nah.,1,0,1282
A27U0CLB8ZMRVP,1111,I had this delivered with an Amazon Fresh order to extend the connection between my desktop and monitor. I hooked it up and experienced shadowghosted video. I tried moving the cable around. avoiding other cables. etc. but noting improved the display. The ghosting is so bad that it gives me a headache to read text on the screen for several minutes. Judging by other reviews. it must be hit and miss on the quality for these cables. If I could rate this a zero. I would have.  This will be going in the garbage.,1,0,511
A27U7Z62JUZAXK,44,Very disappointed at fist to recieve them. as they seemed just paper circles.  But they worked.  I cant even see that the one I used has been used. but it cleared up all the problems with the DVDs I used it on.  THe computer said they were unreadable. but now work just fine.,5,1,275
A27UZPQQ5SHXP4,1315,The description doesnt make clear if this monitor supports Macbooks.  I decided to give it a go since this display is much cheaper than the competition.  You do need the  Mini DisplayPort to DualLink DVI Adapter  cable. the one that also has a USB connection. but it works great with that cable.  I replaced a Samsung 30  monitor that recently died and it is every bit as good a picture as the Samsung.  The only downside I can see is the monitor doesnt have any adjustments other than brightnessvolume. but there is usually not any need for the other adjustments anyway.  The stand swivels but has no updown adjustment. I dont see a single bad pixel on my monitor.  The manual is in Korean but the assembly is obvious if you have assembled anything before.Overall this monitor looks like a great deal for those needing a 30  high resolution monitor.,5,1,850
A27VFOY6CTHJ1F,12,I ordered this head cleaning tape because my VCR displayed a message that said the heads may need cleaning.

A27YB9FUTYT3XC,0,The mdms722 is the greatest buy i have ever had. you can record off of almost anything. you can also record off your computer by going to radio shack and buying a simple wire for like 4 bucks. its amazingly easy to use.  you dont even need to read the manual. it delivers great bass. and the  quality is just as good as cd. if you were debating between a mp3 player  and this. get this. you wont be sorry. the jog dial lets you name tracks  easy. memory cards for mp3 cards might hold more than a minidisc. but they  sure do cost a whole lot more. it has a rechargeable battery. so you dont  need to keep on buying more batteries. I REALLY REALLY URGE YOU TO BUY THIS  PRODUCT. IT SIMPLY IS GREAT.,5,1,697
A27ZXHXWOI2PEO,22,I had the same problem as everyone else. The product didnt work with my Garmin Nuvi 1490T.

Although popup message in the computer tray showed that driver was successfully installed. my HP PC .Windows 7. did not recognize the device at all. Tried several times. to no avail. Worse yet. the floppy disk I inserted in the device got stuck there. The eject switch was ineffective to pop it out.

A28A0A6EDMP5P8,710,in order to read on the package instructions that the cleaning cloths may scratch your discs...but instructions say dont worry it wont affect the playing... I ordered these wipe to clean the discs without risks of scratching them...so I was totally horrified by this information. I currently use a lens cleaning cloth for glasses from my optician. No problem with scratches but more expensive.I RETURNED this product because I was afraid as the package warns that I could scratch my discs. I would not have ordered if anyone had mentioned this information on the website so I could evaluate the risks and make a wise buying decision.,1,0,633
A28A3WZBQGU4O0,34,We put these little radios through several tests hiking and camping the  Cascades this summer and they passed with flying colors. The range was much  better than expected.

A28B1G1MSJ6OO1,2626,This is a great truck GPS. Ive tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND700.Excellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my KenworthCat engine. Ive used it for the last 8.000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multistop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly. it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations. etc.Im running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS. at least with my laptop. despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didnt. the supplied 12volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.My complaints are relatively minor.Battery life when it is unplugged isnt great. However. since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time. it doesnt create too much of a problem.The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesnt tell you .or show you on the map display. what state you are in andor going into. Again. a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For USD500 smackers. I dont expect this kind of slipup.There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately. the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit. showing the position of the slot. Annoying.Clean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.Rand McNally 528881469 7inch Intelliroute TND 700 Truck GPS,4,1,1916
A28C24XEE6LF0M,2122,This reciever has been great for the apartment that Im currently in. Since I cant play it too loud at certain times its prefect.  I choosed JVC cause most .JVC recievers. have nice crisp sound thats not destorted and very clear. compared to others. The 100X2 when listening to music sounds like studio quality and 100X5 surround sound is also great. a JVC DVD player onscreen control. Very easy is to operate wasis a plus.  As far as speakers I have Klispch quintet which are nice also. I would reference this reciever to someone starting out that wants to have a great sounding system thats not to beefy. sounds crisp. a nice look.,4,1,632
A28CZZS5NS2LFD,11,I specifically ordered this adapter for its price and and also because they described as  like new  condition.but that was not the case. The product has scratches all over it. with signs of use everywhere. Theres no  like new  condition at all. and as a plus the wrong type of adapter was shipped to me. I wont even bother in return it because I wont and dont want to have any kind of business with this seller again.very dissapointed.,1,0,435

A28G9RCGYJQJRZ,22,If I could give this a  star I would! Does not work! Save your money and try a different brand. I had a different brand and it worked for 10 years but this did not link up at all. It was suggested that it needed to be on the same circuit as the base. Whose house is wired where all the plugs are on the same circuit! There is only 25 distance between the two plugs so that should not be the problem! Its a piece of JUNK and does not work the way it should.DISAPPOINTED!!!,1,0,471
A28HDWUQBH0DTM,0,This stereo has great sound. I take it to the gym. The only problem with it is when I move around. the headphones go in and out.

A28HJPUATVM7UJ,23,I bought this GPS a few years ago. As I work in the Army and my unit never fitted me with a military GPS. I decided to get one of my own. I was amazed then. It helped me out alot when trying to figure out my position. Its usefulness is limited in forests and in blizzards. which often is when you need the most. It was of course useless inside armored vehicles. but thats more than one can expect unless one has an external antenna.The GPS can usualy track your position within two or three minutes. which is pretty fast. However. if you keep it turned on. it will drain your four AA batteries pretty quick.I have always had the philosophy that one should NEVER solely trust a GPS. One should merely use it as a backup for a map and a compass. For this use. the Garmin GPS12XL is just as good as youll ever need it to be. However. the extra functions are rather primitive and probably most suited for fishers to mark their good spots.Having said all this. I must add that GARMIN has come out with several newer. better. more advanced and even cheaper GPSs. I recommend buying one of those instead. Think carefully and decide wisely.,2,0,1132

A28JEJIO9SJFSK,0,My journey towards owning a nook took kind of a strange path. Id been excited to an ereader. and when I was asked what I wanted for the holidays. my immediate response was a Kindle. I hadnt done any research. knew nothing about it other than it was the only ereader I had heard of due to commercials. conversations. etc.When I received my Kindle. I immediately fell in love. I purchased several books using an Amazon Gift Card and carried it everywhere I went. It was the perfect size. the screen was clear and crisp. and it took seconds to set up. I had heard that my local library had a lending library of eBooks. and day after receiving my Kindle I raced over there to renew my library card. That was where my love affair with my Kindle began to fray.After getting my first book via email. I set about working to get it on my Kindle. Needless to say. this led to hours of frustration. I scoured the internet looking for a way to make it work. to get this ePub book to read on my Kindle. After an exhaustive search. I determined that without breaking dozens of international copyright laws are instantly learning how to hack or rewrite script. I learned how proprietary the device truly was. In fact. if I wanted to read anything. I would have to purchase it from the Kindle store on Amazon.com.  It was with a heavy heart that I deleted all my purchases from my Kindle. packaged it back up. and sent it back to Amazon. To their credit. Amazons customer service made the return process extremely easy. Within days I had my complete refund. including for the books I had purchased.Enter the nook. During my research. I had learned that the nook had the capability to do all the things the Kindle had lacked. It was specifically listed on my librarys site as a capable ereader. and allowed me the flexibility of purchasing from other sites. lending books to friends. or previewing books in store. I found a seller on Amazon who was offering the nook for its expected price of USD149. not the ridiculous markup some of the vendors on this site are asking .in some cases USD180???..the seller shipped the device quickly. and it arrived in the prompt fashion we have come to expect of Amazon purchases.I am very. very happy with my choice. While the nook is slightly larger. and perhaps a bit heavier. it performs like a champ. The eink screen has the same clarity and crispness of the Kindle. and the page turning feels sharp and quick. no different than flicking a page in its ink and paper counterparts. Setup was quick and easy.  I was able to connect to my WEPencrypted Wireless network within seconds. I already had a Bu0026N account. so registration was a breeze. and my first book purchase was quick and easy as well. You have the option of purchasing from the site on your PC or perusing the store right on your nook. and the books arrive within seconds. The reading experience is fantastic. my love of reading ha been renewed after years of growing stale while reading and rereading the covers on my bookshelves at home. I recommend a cover. of which Barnes and Noble offers a myriad of choices for both practicality and style.The only cons towards the nook that I have discovered thus far.1. The touchscreen. unlike the eink screen. has a glossy finish. It took a little getting used to the first time I read my nook. There can be a slight glare. and I recommend setting the touchscreen time out to 10 seconds. After just a few hours of reading. however. I forgot it was even there. I use a book light at night. and all it took was setting up the light so that it didnt reflect off the touch screen.2. The touchscreen is also not what we have come to expect with the advent and popularity of devices like the iPhone and Android. It can be slower than we are used to. but if you got this device primarily for reading as I did. this will be a minor annoyance.And thats really the only downsides I have been able to find thus far. Its also exciting having a brick and mortar storefront to visit with my nook. My first visit to the store with it. I was able to get a free smoothie from the cafe using a coupon from the screen. In fact there are several offers from the store page. including discounts and other offers. Add to this you can read for free in the store. and it just makes for a great experience all around. I stepped into the store. turned on my Nook. and it instantly welcomed me into the store. connecting instantly to their local network and filling me in on current offers.While the Kindle may be the more talked about ereader. the smart choice is the nook. Until Amazon lifts the proprietary restrictions. the Kindle will always be an extraordinary device with ridiculous limitations on its capabilities. Go with the nook. youll be happier in the long run.,4,1,4778
A28K77W5F4V32O,3233,I bought this to replace a 5cd shelf system when the cd function froze.  After buying and returning two other players .different brands and much more expensive. I ended up with this one.  Two features are of the utmost importance to me  random play and quick changes between tracks in random play.  While the time between tracks when changing discs is still unacceptable at about 810 seconds. it is the shortest Ive found.  The two I returned were 21 and 16 seconds. completely unacceptable.  As a comparison. my nowdefunct shelf system was also a carousel changer and only took 34 seconds max to start the next track when changing discs.Like I said. overall its acceptable. but there are two other features that I dont like.  The first is the unadjustable brightness of the display.  If you are one of those people who like to chill in the dark to your favorite music the display is annoyingly bright.  Not a big deal since a layer or two of window tinting can tone it down.The other grievance is that you cannot switch between random and continue play with the music playing.  You have to stop the music to change. which of course means interrupting the current track.As a plus. this unit has a headphone jack and a power button on the remote.  The other two more expensive ones didnt.Since pickings are slim in this category of components. I think its the best for the money.,3,0,1378

A28MO0SHYJVV2E,0,I bought this item when I was running windows 7 and it worked fine.  I am now running windows 8 I tried to use it again and it doesnt work.  I contacted the software provider .Honestech. their response was  The software .VHS to DVD 3 SE. was modified by a third party .mygica.com. therefor Honestech did not support it.

A28N74O5G95H7J,22,We bought this first in 1999 and had the water hitting it directly for 4 years until the rubber covering for the control panel began to disintegrate.  The sound quality is fine .AM is a little tricky. and the weather band is a nice feature to have in a shower radio.  Having just the radio is fine I cant imagine juggling shampoo. soap and CDs in the shower!  Batteries last a long time .about 9 months on average..  We happily purchased this exact same radio to replace the first one.  Its a great shower radio for the price.,4,1,526
A28NC5LQJ67T8B,55,I recently upgrade my comp. to celeron 433 and graphic card to Voodoo3 2000 AGP and hope to get a decent picture quality for the movie. Well. the quality of picture is good. but. my computer crashed daily .blue screen.  because of the excessive heat of the VDO card. Driver that came with the  package was not work. neither did the updated driver on the net. This  happend even when I use 2 fans to help air circulation .one right on the  heat sink. one one the PCI slot.. I have 4 fans in my comp.. does not do  any good. I have to open the computer cover to releif the situation.,2,0,581
A28NE7X6GCDLMZ,410,These were completely useless for me as I bought them for the specific purpose of getting caller ID to a remote location and they dont pass the caller ID info thru! .The DirecTV receiver will display caller ID on the TV screen  great if there is someone with hearing problems in the house. These jacks are advertised to work as a slow modem. whats so hard about passing a little caller ID info thru? Neither the Amazon product description or the packaging gets around to mentioning that caller ID is inop with these devices. you only find it buried in the pamphlet fine print after the struggle to open the plastic encapsulation. Maybe I should have done more research before buying. but I feel cheated.,1,0,703

A28ORIA0YWRKEK,1,I used this cable to hook up my BluRay player to a Ethernet switch.  It was inexpensive and works great.  Would recommend it.,4,1,125
A28OZBLQKKYGOR,0,Another good buy.  Again. very affordable. and they work.  Far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore.  I like the single wire. it seems to be much easier to manage than two of them..,4,1,191
A28OZBLQKKYGOR,0,Had some initial problems. sound output was so low that I could not hear it.  Tech support said to deregister it and reboot.  That cured that problem.  Then WIFI would disconnect without any apparent cause.  Called tech support 3 times. they were helpful and courteous. but we could not solve that problem.  Finally tech support asked me if I had inserted a miniSD card. I had.  They told me to check to see if that it was corrupted. it was.  Reformatting that card solved WIFI problem. although just why it was causing this problem is still a mystery to me.  If you have problems with your NOOK. and you are not able to solve them. and you have inserted a MiniSD card. try reformatting it.I have an Apple IPAD. I bought the NOOK to help me learn and understand ANDROID.  I find ANDROID substantially less user friendly. and the apps cost more and do not work as well.  More importantly. at least to me. is the fact that there are at least a  dozen  apps that I use all the time that have no equivalent in ANDROID.  In short. I will not be buying an android phone to replace my IPHONE anytime soon.,4,1,1098

A28QSW55J70N53,27,hey i just got mine in the mail. works great but only one problem.  the microphone plug goes into the soundcard. the ringtip is slightly offset  just enough that it doenst work right on soundblaster brand cards.  Aparently if you stick the plug in all the way it doesnt work at all. only  when you leave it out about .5 mm does it work. And sometimes it comes  out!  its kinda rediculus..spleling.The plug works fine on my chepo  zoltrix because it has a mono mike input as apposed to the SB brands  stereo. ?  other mono mikes work fine. just this headset is weird.  I  took a close look and compared it to a bunch of mono mike plugs and saw  that the earhugger plug was a little longer....hey 20 bucks well spent?  i guess you get what you pay for.whatever. the earhugger has a decent  ear piece and boom mike. but the plugs quality arent good enough.,3,0,853
A28RDPRKQSEBTV,1414,The Micro Innovations KB400i Windows 98 104key keyboard is a very useful keyboard. The feature that I like the best is that it is spillresistant and it saves space due to its unique design.One thing I dont really like about this keyboard is that it is a white or cream color. I think that those colors are o.k. but for some peoples office supplies.desk chair etc.. they might require a black keyboard.Due to those few lines this is a very good product and it has many advantages,4,1,478
A28TGHVQG50V08,610,I am beginning to think that the speaker I received was definitely defective due to the other glowing reviews. From out of the box. I couldnt get the speaker to stay up .it immediately collapsed every time. which is where the surround sound comes from. and the sound quality was marred by a high pitched hissing. The only positives I could find about this speaker was that it was compact and it was easy to pair with my cell phone. I am now having to go through the process of returning this item I was so excited to receive and am researching another speaker to replace it for my trip.,2,0,586
A28U1V4LIW5HB1,23,My boyfriend has been using this lock daily for the past 4 months to secure his laptop at work.  Today it decided that the combination he had set was inadequate. so it reset itself.  Now we cannot get his laptop off his desk. which defeats the purpose of having a portable computer.  We strongly suggest buying a lock that unlocks via a key.  Do not purchase this lock.,1,0,369
A28UJ5KGAMD9HH,78,We were very happy with this purchase at first. but some of the buttons have stopped working after using it a few times a week for a couple months.  The volume buttons no longer work and the volume cant be adjusted on the laptop. so we have to suffer through a blasting speaker in order to gain the benefits of the microphone. which also seems as if it may be starting to have intermittent problems.,3,0,399
A28VXAFUPJSL2X,0,I originally bought these wireless speakers in the nineties and then bought another pair recently...my hopes were to run all four off the same transmitter but had my doubts this would work because I tried to run the original pair with wireless headphones at the same time...this latter option did not work at all but I was pleasantly surprised that all four speakers operate very effectively together with no interference...Perfectionists beware however...even when I just had the original pair there was occasional  static bursts  .cited by other reviewers. that increased in frequency as a function of how far the speakers were located from the transmitter...The static is most noticeable in between tracks or when the music becomes quiet...When the speakers are in the same small room with the transmitter there is no problem.  When the speakers are in my kitchen beneath the room with the transmitter there is only occasional static however. I cant use the speakers in my family room even though it is within 150 feet of the transmitter...The sound quality when there is no static is very good but you may have to experiment with the placement of the speakers in your own home and try different settings for the tuning knob on each speaker to optimize sound quality.,4,1,1270
A28WEIBTTM21J1,0,Pros for this adapter. The quality of this adapter is absolutely superb. I do not have one adapter that comes close to the build quality of this. It is a hard thick plastic . Neither end is going to loosen up. The only way I can imagine this breaking is if you deliberately hit it with a hammer.As you can see. it is blue. like really blue. It wont be easy to lose. I would have preferred black. as you can easily tell that it is USB 3.0 by the blue in each end. I believe one of the 3.0 standards is a tighter connection. I found this to be true. as it takes a firm push to connect 2 3.0 devices together. and an equal amount of strength to take them apart. I consider this a big plus. as you will always be assured of a positive connection. even if you dont have 3.0 devices. I think that one of the USB standards should also have been gold plating. This is a very high quality adapter. at a very inexpensive price. 5 stars for this product. knocked down to 4 for the misrepresentation of the product. For the quality. I recommend it with no reservations.***There is a problem with the photo that is shown at the top. As there is nothing in the description as to the orientation when it is plugged in. The very clear photo is the only thing you have to go by. And there is no doubt from the photo that this will point up when plugged in. However. I ordered 2 from different sellers. and both were opposite from the pictured one. I asked one vendor if they would send me the one pictured. as obviously. it does exist. They said it wasnt possible to send me the one pictured. What?? They did both refund in full. I posted 2 photos. one of the amazon photo and one of what I got. Please comment if anyone had the same situation. or not. I wanted the up version for USB lights. fans. etc. I recommend that you email the seller prior to purchase and inquire which one you will get. Twice I went by the photo. from 2 different sellers. and twice I received the opposite of the photo image.Thanks for reading. I hope someone finds my review helpful in making a buying decision.Link to one that does point up. u003eApollo234 Pin USB 2.0 A M  F Extension Adapter Connector***Dec.4th.2013  I did post 2 photos. but it seams as though Amazon has removed them. and removed the feature for customers to post images.

A28WMDWA2RVC9G,11,used this unit on a 5 week road trip of alaska. it was hooked up and on for 8.964 miles.  unit is very portable pluged in and set on the small console in front of the gear shift on a 2004 jeep.  was easy to use. used the optional battery cases when we wanted to hear what was going on when we werent in the vehicle.  you will definatly want an antenna that attaches to the top of your vehicle the antenna that comes with it isnt enough to really reach out for distance which is what we did depending on terrain we were then able to get reception anywhere between 213 miles.  liked being able to lock a channel in. was great to have truckers give out so much information just being able to listen to them.  also liked being able to lock into weather channels,5,1,757
A28XOGR365EHQH,22,My GPS 12 cost only slightly more than the ETrex units. and was a giant leap ahead in quality. After comparing reviews of the Garmin and Magellan units. I concluded that the GPS 12 would be the most reliable. and it really does seem to be. Once it aquires the available satellites. it really stays locked onIve used it in the car on the passenger seat. on the armrest. in my lap. and it doesnt lose its position. Ive even held it to a tiny airplane window and tracked my flight accurately. The biggest issue with lowerend GPS units seems to be their ability to hold a lock. and this one performs extremely well.There are two major limitations to this unit. First. it doesnt have an external antenna jack. so you cant add an external antenna .except a rebroadcasting antenna. and theyre pricy.. Second. the flat panel antenna means that you basically need to hold the unit level to work properly. You cant stick it in your shirt pocket. as you could a unit with a helical antenna. The ETrex units have the same limitations. so if you really care about these features youll have to look at the next model up. It hasnt really been a problem for me.The display doesnt have a mapno unit in this pricerange has a map featurebut I find I dont miss it. It does display your track. which Ive used pretty successfully as a sketchy u0026quotmapu0026quot. The GPS 12 has more track and waypoint memory than the ETrex.One minor complaint Ive had is that the unit can take a little while to establish its initial satellite lock. Since I live in the suburbs. Im usually surrounded by housesand the hilly terrain of Pittsburgh. So it may not be the units fault that it cant see the sky very well.All in all. Id say the GPS 12 is about the best value you can get for the money. If you want any noticeably advantage over this unit. you can expect to take a big step up in price.,4,1,1860
A28Y0U9K6BD8OZ,44,After waiting for this technology to drop in price. I am pleased to say that it was worth the wait. Hookup to my existing JVC system was easy.

But that will not be a problem because I can always plug power to my labtop. I use this to access my Ethernet at my school with my Toshiba Win 98.

A290H45ZU7IUKF,0,Overall excellent performance.  However. one glaring problem stands out with this changer that I have never encountered before with all the other changers that I have owned.  It does not show the overall time of the CD.  This might not seem like much but it really is an inconvience if you need to determine how long the music will be playing.  This is a feature I believed to be standard on all players.  I guess its not.  Other than this one problem. its a great machine.,4,1,473

A2928DGP0TB6SJ,0,Over all it is a good radio. however I have not been impressed with the so call ability for it to pick up long range radio stations.  I have not found it to be much better then an older portable radio that I have which is much smaller  and cost much less. IE. I am not able to pick up FM Stations 30 miles away. and can only pick up one AM station that is only 5 miles away.  It is large and the sound is good. The receiver dial is way off IE. a station that should be at 99.9 on the FM dial is found around 101.  This makes me wonder if that is one reason I can not pick up stations on the low end of the dial IE. FM 89.9 and that was my main reason for purchsing this radio. Basically I took a gamble that did not pay off!,2,0,724
A2942K95C66JKS,0,The headphone is okay. but my grandson was a little disappointed in the way it works . but for the money. it was a good buy.,4,1,124
A294CSQXGL76CV,0,These headphones were disappointing. I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the lowfrequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20  30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums.,2,0,583

A297OXOHU51EFO,0,I like the unit. It is small u0026amp light weight. Reception is great...I  can receive all of my favorite stations very clearly without any static. I  am disspointed that Amazon advertises this unit as having 10 FM and 10 AM  preset stations. It only has 10 presets total .5 FM and 5 AM.. I highly  recommend this unit at the sale price of USD19.95.,4,1,350
A298365KFTFXPS,12,Ive had this for a few months. Works great with my Samsung Sway. It connects to any USB port for data transfer tofrom a computer. Charges from computer or USB charging device. Works with my universal USB car charger. It is a quality cord. not a cheap flimsy thin one.,5,1,267
A2985YHJUJAVRE,22,The play button on the front of this unit is driving me crazy!  It depresses with very little pressure. so the Rio regularly gets turned on by accident while I carry it in my bag. By the time I get to the gym the  battery  is dead.  Whoever designed this thing NEVER  carried it around and  used it for any length  of time.,2,0,323
A298COFUERZQWL,713,This is the perfect example of excellent marketing pushing an inferior product to market.  The consumer is fooled into thinking that this u0026quothard caseu0026quot is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim.  when in fact the case is made of PLASTIC and has two VERY thin strips of  aluminum outside the plastic.  This case could easily crack under little  pressure.  I purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the  plastic composition and flimsiness of the case.  For 40 bucks you think  youd get something nice and strong. but save your hardearned money for  some other case.  If you want just something to protect your Palm V in. Id  strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable  than this plastic case.  Even better. go for the leather case that has a  zipper.  For even more protection. go for the Rhinoskin Palm protectors.  Those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money.  considering the amount of money it costs to replace your Palm if you damage  it.The only reason why you should buy this flimsy. overpriced  u0026quothard caseu0026quot is if you have a LOT of money to blow. care more  about looks than functionality. and dont care if your Palm actually gets  damaged.  This case will pop open when you dont expect it. and who knows  what will happen to your Palms panel.,1,0,1357
A298ER4LZRN4KM,23,Recently purchased a nook HD for my daughter for Christmas. We are not happy with the device. and the customer service at B+N leaves A LOT to be desired  especially compared with Amazon. I have been so discappointed in their lack of customer service assistance with this device that I wanted to return it. Amazingly. B+N does not allow returns after 14 days  even at Christmas. I think this is inexcusable. How many other parents are going to have to deal with this problem? How can a company not even consider extending the return policy at Christmas time? Even Apple. a company well known for their less than stellar customer service. understands that sometimes electronics purchased as gifts for the Christmas Holiday are going to be returned and extend their typical 14 day return policy to be 14 days after Christmas for ALL products purchased between October and December 24th. I will certainly never buy another device from Barnes and Noble. I find this policy to simply be unacceptable. and hope that potential buyers of this device consider this next year when considering their gift purchases!,1,0,1103
A298Q3B5R3X54L,11,Bought this in 2004 and it going great. 16x50 is on the higher end and I would recommend a smaller one because slight shake in the hand makes the objet move a lot. otherwise eit is good.,5,0,186

A299Z436TCJBYB,1,I purchased my Digital Camcorder while visiting the baseball spring training in Florida.  I hadnt really done a lot of research but was an owner on an Hitachi Camcorder and had numerous electronic problems with it.  I found this unit easy to use with one review of the instruction manual.  I  agree with the person from Orlando that the offon switch is cumbersome but  it is something you have to adjust to. The snap shot feature is great as it  gives you a great still picture and breaks up the traditional viewing of a  long recording.  The clarity of digital is superior as I have my old VHS  cassettes to compare it to. Im in the market for JVCs JLIP unit which  allows you to interface the camcorder and computer for downloading  pictures.  I paid 12 the price for this unit vs. the Hitachi and would  totally recommend it to the everyday family movie taker.,4,1,863

A29DXM47EFIN60,1,I have had this receiver for about 7 years and I have never had a problem with it.  The sound quality is better than you would expect and the Amp runs clean up to a little less than max power.  Solid. wellpriced. and simple.  I would not throw this receiver in the trash...Sincerely.An average guy with no agenda.,4,1,313

A29EIENDVFUVBK,1,Disappointed! Im not sure if it was deffective or if all are like this. but mine does not transmit any sound. Video is ok. but lets face it. not worth even this ridiculous price if an HDMI cable is not able to transmit soud.,2,0,224

A29ERXIEXWKSU,1,The radio arrived in its worn and torn original box with a sticker that said it was a remanufactured unit. Guess thats why it was USD40. In my haste to acquire it. I failed to notice the paragraph at the bottom of the ad stating that it was remanufactured. My fault for sure. but I suggest that in the future this information should be more prominently displayed at the top of the ad.Radio had dirt and scratches on the case and a bent antenna. Not cool. Frequency coverage inadequate.With great dissatisfaction. and also some embarrassment for not drilling down into the specifications. I am returning this thing.,1,0,614
A29FA20X0XO233,44,All it does is charge the phone..no data. no instructions. no recognition on the computer.  A total waste of money and shipping expense.,1,0,136
A29GANDIIX0H4Y,0,Received the wall mount but not the free bubble level and HDMI cable as advertised.  Amazon had no solution other than just send me a label to return the mount.

I found the mount cheaper on another site and will buy it from them instead.,1,0,379

A29H22EZ29AUSK,0,Not only do they not work but after checking all five one jammed into VCR and would not eject could have caused permanent damage to my unit which works perfectly otherwise.  I found others on staples website and am picking them up.  I notice all of the cleaners on Amazon are grossly overpriced. As well as shipping... 10.00or more to mail a video!

A29I1X2ULFSCIH,16,First off. VHS is always going to suck.  SVHS is nice .almost Laser Disc quality.. but regular is lame.  Still though. many things are only available on VHS so why not just record them?  Ive used quite a few 10  hour tapes .largely for marathons and 3 hour movies in SP. in my time. and  these ones are plenty good.  Needless to say. USD10 for 3 is also a pretty  good price.  Oh yeah. why was that guy transferring Laser Disc to video  tape?  Its not like Laser Discs die .as tapes of all kind do.. and the  players last forever.  You cant get much money for them used. so why would  he sell them?,4,1,598
A29LPQQDG7LD5J,814,I have owned two Rand McNally GPS devices over the last two years. Buyer beware! They are pieces of junk. The software is great. but the hardware does not last. The first GPS lasted a year. I spent another USD400. that one lasted about 14 months. If you dont mind spending USD400 a year for a GPS buy one. Otherwise do not buy it it is the worst and most expensive piece of junk I have ever bought. I still use my original GARMIN I purchased in 2006.,1,0,450
A29M533MOVDZ1A,0,Pictures taken in High resolution are realy nice. although colors are shifted litle a bit to blue. but when you set to Low Res to spare some memory space. pictures get some unexpected and ugly artifacts on homogenous  surfaces .like face for example..Thats not only due to lower  resolution but rather to something wrong in software resizing in cameras  firmware itself.If you take HiRes and resize on you PC. everything is  OK.If you want to be able to store 30+ pictures on your digital camera  .youll have to use Low Res.. dont buy CL30. If you dont care how many  pictures you can store before download. for less then 300USD youll have nice  1M pixel  USB digital camera.,2,0,675
A29MRSU25Y5T8X,1113,Ive had this radio for about two years and Im still on my first set of batteries. It lasts forever.  And the reception is awesome.  Im very glad I chose this one.,5,0,162

A29NPHL8SQLF2N,0,The installation of this card was a breez once I got a set of working drivers.  The CD that came with my card was unreadable in the 2 CDrom drives in my computer.  When I contacted ATI via Email about the problem they said download the drivers. and that they didnt want to give me a new  CD! I found this appaling for what would they have done if I was a customer  without net access?  Great card just their customer support is a little  iffy in my mind.,4,1,454
A29NRTGCVF8FVP,1212,I wanted a highly portable amfm stereo radio. with provision for ac adapter and stereo headphone jack. with excellent fm stereo reception.  The shortwave is a bonus Ill figure out later.  In the meantime. I got  everything I wanted.  The fm reception is outstanding.  As a test. I set it  up on my office desk. at least 6 feet from the nearest window. using the  ac.  I work in a high rise amidst a forest of high rises in midtown  Manhattan. a very tough fm reception location.  This radio pulled in  excellent stereo reception of WBGO 88.3. WFUV .Fordham. 90.7. and WNYC  .93.9.. all of which will be familiar to NYC listeners as great but  lowpowered public radio stations at the low end of the dial that are hard  to get.  The sound is excellent through the headphone jack.  The reception  is at least as good as the Kloss Model 88 .which I still highly recommend.  and which is permanently ensconced on my window sill with a Magnum Dynalab  Silver Ribbon antenna..  I cant ask for anything more.The only  reason I give 4 rather than 5 stars is that I have not attempted to  seriously appraise the models shortwave performance.,4,1,1131
A29OJBE89XRIW6,1415,After buying one for my 47  LED TV. I ordered 2 more for my daughters sets. It goes up easy. adjusts to any position. It folds flat against the wall and had a low profile. for the money and 2 day amazon prime shipping. you just cant do better.,5,1,243

A29PQH8RIUG4KZ,34,For a slightly less price. you can get yourself a negative pulse charger.  A negative pulse charger strips away sulfate buildup and gas bubbles that basically ruins any rechargable batteries.Take a look at the Maha C210 charger or Radio Shack cat 23422 pulse charger.  Theyre microprocessor controlled so that you cant overcharge your batteries.  With the C210 you can charge any type of battery ranging from 3V to 12V.,3,0,419
A29PY6JA6XATW8,3641,Usually if it sounds to good to be true.it is. but not in this case. This was very reasonable price and the cable works perfect with my new Canon Digital Camera. You cant go wrong with this one.,5,0,194
A29R87ANBPSFFH,22,I have mixed feelings about this camera.  I have been using it for the past year and have found that while my outdoor picutres come out nicely. indoor shots leave something to be desired.  I have tried shots with 200 to  800 speed film and 400 seems to give me the best pictures.  Ive also  noticed that the pictures used with the zoom lense often come out fuzzy. so  many of my early pictures werent too clear.  Also. when the camera uses  the flash. it takes a while before its ready again.  I expected more from  the camera. but am happy with its basic outdoor shots.,3,0,570
A29S0BU8OZKXQN,4444,I had no problem installing it. Set up was easy.  Games do very well on my system and for the price I cant beat it.  I am going get another one for my other system.,4,0,164

A29X5IHNLT8BRA,67,Ive had this camera for about 1 month and I must say its a great purchase! Ive had 2 other digital cameras prior to this one .SONY and KODAK. and they were fine cameras as well. but no comparison to this camera  if what you want is quality pictures and. if you desire. a challenge if you  use the manual mode. The optional floppy disk reader makes it a snap to  download the pictures to a computer. Ive actually taken pictures that look  better than my other regular 35 mm camera. after printing them in photo  glossy paper. Excellent buy!,4,1,539
A29XLD0DHKQXDG,0,Hi all.Well. I was the first to buy one of these cards inSouth Africa. And yes there were some pitfalls. but Ill get intothose later ...At the price it is a great card. DVD facilities. digital VCR. graphics accelerator and a whole host of usefull software included in the bundle.The graphics of the card are great. I was originally going for the 32M Riva TNT but when I saw the features of this card I was sold.  Playing Halflife. Unreal. Speed 3. StarWars pod racer I have NO complaints  this card does what its supposed to ...As far as the pitfalls go. Hmmmmmm . documentation inside the box . well. it is in all languages possible but doesnt really tell you much !I was trying to read German to see if there was anything that was skipped out in the English version !  There is an online fault reporting service but they do take their time replying but they did manage to clear up one of my problems  I am still waiting for a reply for the other.I would really reccomend a large hard drive for the video capture feature. the files are BIG when saved in editable formats  but the software bundle does include a utility to compress the video into MPEG2 format which is a lot smaller but is still big.All in all. yes I would reccomend this card. I mean look at all of the features compared to a VoodooRiva  fair enough. their graphics may be marginally better but video capture.editing.video output and others are a very usefull thing !Later.Mark,4,1,1445
A29XO99AE1HCJB,2323,The sound quality of these headphones was relatively poor but that is not why I returned them. The range was about 25 feet on the same floor and then loud static would come and go at different locations in the house. This was  very consistent. In the basement they were useless. I replace them with a  set by RCA model wph150 for USD30 less and the sound was much better and no  problem anywhere in the house.,1,0,409
A29XPB4YTMCH7N,3536,It is my own fault for not being more careful when buying this. Had I done more research into the different Nook Tablets. I would have discovered that the one I bought was an early generation OS and the software has been improved on the newer versions. It is an excellent reader and has. with the SD card. more storage than Ill ever use..... I dont do movies or videos but. even if I did. I expect it has more than enough to keep most people happy worst case is you buy another SD card.Ive seen the Nook 7  HD. which I mistakenly thought was the same as this Nook 7  Color. but that was bad thinking. The updateupgrade function for the software told me right off that the system couldnt be updated. Ive seen the 7  HD Nook with the newer OS and it seems to be much more intuitive..... and have many more features that youve probably come to expect.At the price I paid. USD100. I could have gotten a better tablet..... or. with more research. I could have gotten this one for much less. It does work and I will either become accustomed to its system or pass it along and get a different tablet.,2,0,1093

A2A3HDJXDN8W47,1618,Heres my take on NST.  This is a very nice. but very limited reader.  I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  Thats it.  A real home run?  Not quite...Quick summary is that they wont sell me any other unit with an LCD .I spend all day looking at one of those. I dont want another one for my funreading..  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet. and that wont be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing..1. You cant use it for a PDF. magazine. or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you cant see.  Guess they want you to get the color tabletlike Nook. huh?  Nope. not going there .see above...2. YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah. yeah. they SAY you can. but thats VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  .If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all. why cant you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?. I can get a paperback. read it. and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it..3. B+N .and everybodys. EBOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK. even though the seller didnt incur any cost of printing. shipping. inventory. etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers. or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% .or more. off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book. I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  Thats a winwin.So. wheres the advantage with a Nook other than its cool?  Three strikes .it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book..  This whole ereader thing is bravosierra at this point.Thats my USD0.02.  Just wish I had known this before I spent the hundred dollars.,1,0,1802

A2A5KNFNPUWXNJ,22,I bought this DVD. my sister bought this DVD. and my brother and sister in law both bought as well at the same time. After about a year and a half of use they are All NONFUNCTIONAL. displaying C 13 errors and NO DISC for all the DVDs that I try to play. some didnt even last that long. Sony should be ashamed to have produced such a poor product. I would recommend not buying any SONY product based on this experience.,1,0,418
A2A6AH66XJNGPY,78,It is hard to believe just how cheap stereo VCRs are getting. only a few years ago you couldnt find one for less then USD250 and now they are starting at under USD150.  In the past I have had the oppertunity to use several differant brands of VCRs and have had nothing but trouble.  I have  had a Panasonic VCR that in less than a year went into the repair shop  twice because a tape had gotten stuck in the unit.  Ive had a Magnavox VCR  that didnt even last a year and a half. Ive also used a Toshiba. and  another Panasonic unit at my former work. and I must say that they were two  of the most tempermental video units that Ive ever used. This Sony unit  .that I just got. is similar to my other Sony .SLV675HF. that is almost 3  years old now.  In the three years that Ive had my Sony VCR. I have never  had a problem with it.  It is easy to use. program. and if you cant set  the clock you must be stupid.  The picture has always been great .for VHS.  I prefer the quality of DVD.. and it records like a champ.  The remote is  one of the best Ive used. the only thing that would make it better is  backlighting .but thats just nitpicking..  If you need a new VCR. buy a  SONY.  In a weird side story. both my sister and I bought new VCRs the  same week.  She got a more expensive Hitachi. and I got my beloved Sony.  and of the two units the Sony is the better performer.,4,1,1377

A2A6STHG4EZHD4,2529,Just plug it into the microphone jack and vwalla you can record stuff onto your Ipod Touch! I use mine for voice recordings of trail directions for mountain bike tours. No complaints with that. My one complaint stems from a fear of loosing the little thing.  While the cap does have a small opening for a key chain ring or something.it promptly broke when trying to put the ring on. So. just be very careful if you try to attach it to a key chain ring. Despite this design weakness. its a penny well spent.,4,1,506
A2A7Z9IK1GOTW8,22,I have owned many radar detectors. and the ESD 6700 is by far the worst.  I am not just saying this.  It has the absolute worst sensitivity and only quietly beeps .at its loudest volume. when a police car is about 50 feet in  front of your vehicle.  I always see the cop before the detector begins to  beep.  Ka band sensitivity is even worse!  With this band. it beeps only  once as you are passing the cop. and not before. This is no joke.  I took  my first ESD 6700 back to the store because I thought that it was  defective. but the second one was just as bad.  As the signal gets  stronger. the beep frequency does not increase. it only beeps about three  times for about three seconds very slowly until you pass the threat.  I am  fixing to throw it away. it is trash!,1,0,774
A2A9NAOV2RMPQ8,1416,I just moved into my dorm room and found out that I couldnt use my wireless router to get online with my laptop. so I purchased this 50Foot cable by Belkin. Ive never had my connection get dropped and I never have to wait for a connection when I boot my computer. This even sells for less than the 25Foot cable by Belkin. I always trust Belkin for internet connection components and will continue to for a long time.,5,1,416
A2AAWK6K2YBCJD,44,Excellent bag.... Very comfortable and holds lot more stuff then I originally thought.  Comes with combination lock and there is a zipper in the middle to expand it by couple of inches is needed.  I would compare  this bag against TUMI computer bags. which cost about USD395 to USD495.  Again.  great job by Amazon!,5,1,315
A2AB6TUU6XFWFY,2930,A space saver. I have 100s of books and have ran out of space. so this will help me save space and still enjoy my books.,5,0,120
A2ACE6C6O11GYM,0,Bought it to replace a lost card for my GPS. It is well worht the price. I was easy to load and easier to install all of the maps.,5,0,130
A2ADBSV32ZMKLZ,0,This product is great it saved me the hassel of looking through every cd case I own to find a blank cd that i made myself. I just place them in this and flip through when i want to listen to the cd. This item is great. everyone should have one of these!,4,1,253
A2ADL2YQ3LOBE8,33,This item did what it said it would do. It worked as a ethernet and modem connection. It just seemed a little flimsy and i had to be careful handling it.,4,1,153
A2AEZK0K9CFVE6,0,Item arrived as described. however was not the correct adapter for our camera.  Trent at A Days Tech was very eager to help and did all that he could to solve my problem.,5,0,170
A2AEZQ3DGBBLPR,22,I bought this repair kit so I could watch a rental movie.  It had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts.  After I was done. I had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before.,1,0,228
A2AEZQ3DGBBLPR,57,This visor does not fit well on my two vehicles.  The spacing on the velcro loops needs to be about 12u0026quot wider to both not obstruct the mirror. or get caught in the little bar that holds the cars visor and allows it to rotate up and down.,2,0,245
A2AEZQ3DGBBLPR,33,I get only 2.15 of battery life on average. barely enough to watch a good movie.Id love to see cheaper packs. or a camera battery add on option.It plays +R but not +RW disks.,4,0,174
A2AEZQ3DGBBLPR,25,I have 2 portable minidisc players. and this worked very nicely to convert CDR disks to minidiscs.The remote has a fairly large size keypad. which makes quick work out of titling new minidiscs. vs using a small palmsize recorder.,5,1,229
A2AF8QHEBSBL9X,1,This was the best price on this card for my phoneDelivery was on time and the correct product was providedThe most memory in this price range.I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking to upgrade their memory,4,1,215
A2AFGNDUPNWVSN,0,Yeah. yeah. so if were looking at these cassette adapters we already know were not on the cutting edge of the tech world.  But this is still a great way to couple audiobooks and music from my smart phone to the sound system in my ancient crate.  Works way better than any FM transmitter Ive ever tried .although I admit I gave up after the first one or two..  And the quality of this Maxell unit is at least as good as anything else Ive come up with the last few years. particularly for the price.  The heads look well made .Ive seen others that were downright crude. and the mechanism is quiet after six months use.  Sound quality is certainly good enough. although my car is noisy enough that its not a big issue.  I cant discern any difference between what comes through this adapter and sound off CDs in the factory player. so its sure good enough for me.  Im not an audiophile. but if I was I wouldnt be messing with cassette adapters!,5,1,940
A2AFT2VCH2S01B,12,Dont travel with the cradle. and dont wait until you return from a trip to synch with your laptop.  Just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case.  This is especially useful for Palm VIIs. which cant use the  version of PalmOS that supports synching through the IR port.This cable  does not have a synchronize button. In order to use it. connect the cable.  turn on your Palm. press the HotSynch icon. and press the LocalSynch icon.Remember that leaving your Palm in the cradle or leaving this cable  connected to both your Palm and your computer will put an extra drain on  your batteries. so you should unhook your Palm as soon as you finish  synching.,4,1,667
A2AGGWPJZODA0A,2727,I gave it to my granddaugter for christmas with a gift certificate. My daughter says she loves it u0026 it helps her improve on her reading skills.,1,0,147
A2AI7LTXKKZWZB,2,I bought this unit to use with my netbook. mainly for school. I got about 5 uses out of this thing. It just stopped working for some reason. Im highly upset because I need this type of device for school and now I have to return this piece of junk. and buy another one! Dont take your chances!,1,0,292
A2AIPTN34DII56,22,After reading all the above reviews I bought the SL PD8 anyway as Ive never had a problem with any Technics product Ive purchased. My skip button is horizontal and I can use it with the drawer open although it  isnt the easiest way. but knowing the remote had the same button and the  openclose drawer also I purchased it and I just use my remote instead of  the player. The only problem I had after hooking it my Sherwood receiver  was that a CD with a singer wasnt right the singer sounded like in a echo  chamber. and the mucis overpowered him or her. I tried everything the  technician said to do even trying it on my Technics receiver to no avail.  but when plugging in the rca lines I must have tightend the one on the  player as they are hard to push on tight. and my player worked perfectly. I  am thoroughly enjoying the sound and the clarity is excellent.,5,1,865
A2AIVO7JAXEH0W,45,The unit would not work out of the box. I bought this one and a TEAC unit at the same time. Neither of the units worked on any of my PCs. When I called the tech support line the support person was very rude and said he could not help. He gave me a link to return the unit. Instead of getting a return authorization all I got was an email telling me to download the manual .which I had already done.. I returned both units to Amazon. Very bad experience.,1,0,453
A2AJ1W0O379SUP,11,For the money its worth it. It does all it needs to do looks good and functions well. I was sorry I didnt look closer for I missed it had no head phone jack. Something I would have liked and wanted. But my fault and a few extra connectors and Im in business.,4,1,258
A2ALRD1DZHX7ZY,55,It works. easy to install. The 400x400 was kind of long and stuck out of the bottom of my 50  about a half an inch.. For the price you cant beat it.,4,1,148
A2ANBGU9D8ETI9,0,These small KLH speakers were just what I was looking for in a low cost. very attractive bookshelf style pair for my office. The sound quality is adequate .especially in an office setting where better base would bother my  coworkers down the hall.. The small port in the back is a feature Ive  always favored.  Amazon.com service was quick as usual.,4,1,349
A2ANH48QAOILJ3,2325,This is a very good camera for someone who is just getting started with digital photography. I am very well satisfied with my pictures. However. close ups of items such as jewelry are not too good. But. for a small price  for pictures of other things you cant go wrong.,3,0,269
A2AOEW5UGXFOOQ,1315,Back in the old days we used to use a phone number and a road atlas.Those days are over now.Just type in the address and go.The Intelliroute will get you there with no worries about low underpasses or any other areas those 4wheeler GPS systems may not be aware of.If you dont have one.what are waiting on?,5,1,305
A2APYM14GTDYXN,12,A great item but it quit playing back after about 9 months of use.  You could get bits of the messages by holding the mode button down momentarily.  The gold paint wears off carrying it in your pocket.,2,0,201
A2AQELCD6PWR6B,79,Bought this as it seemed neat. never worked as a stand alone. needed to keep it plugged into USB port to work. Useless. VERY disappointing.,1,0,139
A2AQNZ3108SBI7,33,Item as described. no surprises.  Works as stated. plug and play. Great for retrieving data off old diskettes. Compact and easy to store.,4,1,137
A2ARI3VZQJYHFQ,0,This cd player is excellent. although it isnt perfect. Its to your benefit to use the skip protection unless youre not moving. The headphones have less than average sound quality. Other than that. the cd player is  great. The boost bass works very well. The player itself is surprisingly  slim. It looks great. plays great. and. with a new pair of headphones .Sony   trust me on that. sounds great. Its priced quite nicely considering it  comes with a car kit and AC adapter. If youre looking for a new cd player  and dont want to spend too much. this is a great buy.,4,1,567
A2ARU4LMNGLMI4,2730,Professional Ultra ScanDisk MicroSDXC 16GB gigabyte card for samsung san disk was not what i wanted i wanted a disk for my camera this is good for a phone i cannot use it i did not find anything wrong with it,3,0,208
A2ARZRHKQOZE0W,1,Ive  had this unit for about 5 years and it finally died so Im looking at different ones.  USD300 for USD20 radio?  I dont think so.,4,0,132
A2AS288JKY3743,12,This product was a waste of time. I waited like a week and 12 for it to come. then try to test it out and realize they sent me the wrong item.  Ill never buy an item like this again from here.,1,0,192
A2AS69LEX6ZUJ4,5,This is an excellant modem for any user. Works great on my laptop so I can take my work with me and connect to update. Only problem I have is that I will be installing Win2k on it and they havent finished drivers for it. I emailed them and they say they are in final stages. Would recommend this  to anyone...,4,1,309
A2ASNFIHWYCPIV,11,I ordered two cables and both work as expected. They arent as thick as other cables I own. but should work fine in a static position. I plan on keeping this cable in my laptop bag. so something more protected would be nice. Im afraid it wont last forever. On the plus side. it doesnt take up much room and is definitely replaceable at this price.,3,0,346
A2ASX8RGDVFNOG,0,Great bargain for what you get. I wish it could adjust with having to turn bolts.I would recommend this to a friend.,4,1,116
A2AT63KLSZ6LXO,0,First of all. I LOVE this product. When I bought it my husband jokingly said that it looked cute and small in the picture. but was really HUGE in real life. Dont tell him I said so. but he was right. It is huge and the cord is really long. Although I wish it was smaller. I still love it. It works really well when we travel and need to plug a lot of things in and although the length is annoying. its very useful.,4,1,414
A2ATP6ZTCPX1QX,23,Im not one to complain much but I hate old products that get mixed in with the new. This is one I should have returned but missed my chance due to events happening. This was ordered by mistake. Im sure it works just not for any of my devices.,1,0,242

A2AVRXPWKB81NX,33,I bought this item to attach to my netbook so my grandson could watch DVDs.  It works just fine.  Have since used it to copy some photos and other data.Only problem was the disc that cam with the device was for much older versions of Windows.  Had to go online to find the right driver for Windows 7.  No big deal. but would have been nice had the software shipped with the drive been updated.,4,1,393
A2AW1SSVUIYV9Y,0,I purchased this product not to use in commerical trucking but rather to use when I am traveling with my 5th wheel RV.  So far this product as been very good.  Rand McNally folks seem to be working to continue to improve the software along with prompt updates.  Although designed for the trucking industry it works great for us RV folks as well.  I found for a 2500 HD pickup the unit is a little large for the windshield.  I use the unit with a mount that fits in my cup holder and that has worked out great.  I would recommend this product.,4,1,542
A2AWLR3N6SOZDJ,12,I bought three to have on hand. one didnt work at all. The previous Maxell cleaner I used  had a visual walk through of the cleaning process. this shows nothingdont even know if it is actually doing anything! I know these VCRs are virtually obsolete. but I use mine all the time and am very disappointed with this version of the cleaner.,1,0,337
A2AX27FDFOLUGL,44,The inline volume control does not work. moving the volume control slider can change the volume to go up. down. then one ear. then the other. etc. Very flakey. I purchased another one thinking it was just a problem with the one I bought. and sure enough the same problem. Not worth the grief. I had one of these for a year and it worked well and when I lost it I tried to buy the same thing. but even though the part number was the same as the old one. it was a different unit .different length wires. volume control in different spot.. Unfortunately they must be using a new supplier.,1,0,585
A2AX3PEW8T94MI,0,This item was awful. I plugged it in and within 5 minutes it was sparking and smoking. I was not able to charge my battery. It was all I could do to get it unplugged without hurting myself.,1,0,189
A2AXDQ88S4AEVL,0,Like others. I find the cord impossible to rewrap into the compartment. Theres a slot through the back cover to route the cord through. so Im probably going to just wrap it with a rubber band and leave it out. A builtin cord retractor would have been nice. Reception is soso. but Im in a building where any kind of radio reception is hard to get. The radio sounds pretty good.,4,1,376
A2AXLB80YUCLCI,0,After buying this Advent Headphone for USD99.99 from amazon.com. i found that this headphone is not what i thought about it after reading about it on the net and the booklet included with the headset at the first sight.According to the manual the range is 300 feet. This is not true in the case of a scenario in which you use the headphone with walls e.t.c between the transmitter and the headphone. I placed the transmitter on the top floor of my house and the sound quality was very good in the area of about 60 * 50 feet on my top floor with concreate walls in between and wood doors. but when i went downstairs. the real thing showed up. While moving around i could easily hear hissing sound which disappers when i stop walking. Moreover the signal also became weak. I adjusted the frequency from the headphone but of no use. So whats the use. even i went up and changed the frequnency of the headphone and the transmitter again. but when i came back same was the result. The sound becomes louder when i came under the room in which i placed the transmitter. Allover it showed variable sound and i was just about 30 feet away from the transmitter with concrete walls in between.The second thing is that i went in the opposite direction of the room on the same floor in which i placed the transmitter and when i was about 20 feet away with 2 concrete walls in between and many glass windows. the signal was over. I belive that the 300 feet range is a marketing strategy or if its possible. its in an open space like a ground. In a house or through walls. its impossible.The headphone comes with 3 NiCD. rechargable batteries which are placed in the headset and the headphones are connected to the transmitter with a charging cable. The transmitter is then connected to the power outlet to charge the headphones. The initial charge is 24 hours .Plays 5 to 6 hours.. Average charge is 1012 hours .Plays 34 hours. and Extended Charge is 1618 hours .Plays 56 hours.. There is no indication of any type that the batteries are being charged on both the headphones and the transmitter.The headphones comes with Y cable adapter. AC adapter. charging cable and headohone adapter plug also. The accessories are enough to plug anywhere.This thing is made in China and the quality is not bad. the headphones fit very easily and are comfortable enough to fit over the ear but the grip of the headphones over the head is not so tight. if you look down the headphones also looses some of its original location and they might fall from your head if you jerk your head down.The transmitter is very light weight and its quality is not so good. moreover its not so powerful. but it works till the distance i have specified with very good results. The antenna of the transmitter is very light weight and it can break easily if not proper care is taken.Over all the headphones are of good quality material but not the transmitter.The range is not 300. its about 70 to 90 feet .works very good in this range. with walls e.t.c in between and in an open space it is more. The sound quality is very good if you are on the same floor of the transmitter but distorts if you go on different floor.The price is high as compared to the product. It should be around USD60.Note. This is a totally clear review of the product deflecting my own experience. I am not in the opposition of this company or product neither i have tried any other wireless headphones of this or some other company. You may observe the functioning. quality e.t.c of the headphones as deviated from the results which i have written in this review.,3,0,3592
A2AXM4W8F1OQY4,1313,Diamond sold off their video card business soon after this card was released back in 19992000.  Ive never had the Generic TNT2 drivers work quite right for it. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.,1,0,199
A2AY39ER2XJMLI,0,Compare to other expensive headphones. .for example. the Dr.Dres Beat. the quality of sound may not be good. However. it is good enough to listen music or play an instrument. More importantly. it comes out with the adapter which is a huge plus! I highly recommend this for those of you who dont want to spend excessive amount of money for headphones.,5,1,350
A2AYALIDS9S0CZ,12,If you are a jogger and go for 4560 minutes. the Diamond pmp300 is the greatest thing since sliced bread!  The player is superlight. has NEVER skipped. and the downloadmusic selection software works great.  I converted some of my favorite jammin CDs .from my own personal library. to  96 kbs MP3s and get about an hour of very acceptable sound quality.  The  quality is much better than cassette but not quite that of CD.  I have had  the pmp300 for 8 months and have not experienced any problems at all.  I  would highly recommend using the RealJukebox player for  recording and storage of your MP3 library.  It works great with the pmp300.  This might be the best hundred bucks I ever spent!  Get one!,5,1,703
A2AYVN7XSO4XB4,33,I have never been as satisfied with a purchase as I have been with the Superadio III.  It is a sucessor to the SRII. and is even more sensitive than its predecessor.  I have done a comparative review between this model and its supposed clone at. and found that the SRIII is clearly a different. and far superior product.  The 12903 is a new model from RS that merely repackages the previous design.  So if you want a quality radio with extremely good AM reception on distant stations. the SRIII is the product for you.  The SRIII also has a wide bandwidth position that allows high fidelity listening on local stations.  Those customers considering the CCrane unit should be aware that CCrane equalizes its audio for speech. making music listening poor.  FM reception of the SRIII is good as well. stations up to 100 miles away are receivable under some conditions.  The only negative points that I can find with the SRIII are the lack of a ten kHz audio filter and the lack of an AM stereo .as well as FM stereo. decoder. that would allow stereo listening through headphones.,5,1,1076
A2B082GZNO903U,2323,I bought the Nook Tablet as a gift because of the previous tablet had been worn out. She adores it and takes it just about everywhere she goes. Its great to help out with homework for those difficult questions that are beyond her parietals expertise.,4,1,250

A2B0LA5S97TYW1,612,This was purchased for a good friend of mine. She is a TECHNO geek and once I saw the blue tooth capability I knew this would be great. I however was not prepared for how well she liked it and what great sound this little device puts out. Now Im becoming a bit of a techno geek .These will definitely be a staple in my upcoming Xmas shopping.Thank youESG,5,1,354
A2B21POKQ3N09H,33,...The unit is easy to use and the instructions are simply presented and very clear cut.  My wife uses it without complaint and is always happy with her results.On the other hand. the unit does have some niceu002665533though limited advanced features such as preset exposures. special effects. and Sonys unique NightShot feature.  My daughter especially likes the special effects package.  I particularly appreciate the Night Shot feature.  I video a lot of youth sporting events that can involve a lot of transitional lighting issues. especially on those evenings around the time change seasons. an this unit handles all those issues very well.  It does a commendable job in moonlight as well.The unit is well designed and rugged.  It is not a choice for diehard vidoephilesu002665533the range of advanced features is too limited. but they should be adequate for normal family outing type use.Battery life using the LCD is rather short. The viewfinder picture is black u0026 white.  Using it rather than the LCD expands battery life significantly but the quality of he picture in the viewfinder is not good.The audio quality is average.  Functionality of interface with other devices .TV. PC. etc.. is good.On the whole. a great unit to start out with or for more adventurous outings where camera safety might be an issue.  .I took this one white water raftingu002665533not my stateoftheart unit...  It has enough features to give a feel for an advanced unit without overwhelming the user. provides better than average output and cost wise is a relative bargain.,4,1,1563

A2B4F6LP0ZLI8E,78,I bought this item to replace the original charger that Id lost. think is pricey and I was disappointed when I noticed the box only had the adapter. as the original box had both the plug and adapter. Dont buy just by the picture displayed. make sure to read the description. I am still missing the USB cable,3,0,307
A2B4G8RR98L56W,11,The Elph Jr. is a great camera. no doubt about that.  I own the older black matte finish Jr.  There are some things that are not mentioned here that are important though.  I notice that there is a lot of red eye in my  photos.  After doing my research. this has to do with the fact that the  flash is so close to the lens.  Notice how the other Elph models have  flashes that are mobile .i.e. they move *away* from the lens.?  This is to  prevent the terrible redeye issues.  The Elph Jr. has no such protection.  The flash is also weak. which is a bit of disappointment.The camera also  doesnt support midroll change. which can be obnoxious if you dont use up  rolls of film quickly.Otherwise. the pictures are good.  You *can* see  the grain. especially in panoramic shots. but it isnt a big deal.  This  camera is ultra small. which means you can put it in your jeans pocket and  take it with you anywhere.  Developing costs more. but they also can use  the picture data encoded on the film to correct for some poor shots .light  levels. etc..,4,1,1046

A2B6HT09K8XLUN,0,I love this case. it looks really sophisticated and love that it stands on its own. However. I wish it protected the sides more because when I put it in my purse with keys. Im afraid itll get scratched.,4,1,202
A2B6PK1HWIVYNI,0,Cmon USD50!  That annoys me. but a cradle also costs USD50 so really i guess its the same thing. plus you get all the adapters for different countries.I use the product even when im not traveling to other countries. but if im staying at a friends house or visiting the folks. ill bring the charger.  The sync attachement is good for using other peoples computers to do a quick program download.Since my palm is ESSENTIAL to my life. i find this a very useful product.  I am annoyed however. that i cant just buy the american charger piece by itself for say. USD15USD20.If you are traveling you will NEED this item.,4,1,614
A2B7R69TZSJA8C,22,I bought this cord to deter people from waltzing off with my work laptop. It feels and looks good and sturdy. and doesnt have any obvious glitches or defects. so its doing there job well in that respect. It is a bit bulky. which works for my work computer .which is ~1  thick at the hinge.. but it wouldnt be suitable for my newer ultrabook.,4,1,341
A2B9C7AQDPE04Z,1,I cant believe this company doesnt support NT or Win 2000. The lack of support for u003e32 MB Smart Media cards is also annoying. The manufacturer should wake up.,1,0,162

A2BA03DPLGR2WX,1,I love reading but hate carrying books around in my bag. they end up with pages bent or dirty from accidental spills. I bought my nook color in an attempt to make part of my extensive library portable when I was riding the bus and I fell in love with it. The responsive. bright screen. the endless customization. the ability to have some android apps to help when I just cant read anymore all quickly helped make my nook one of my favorite electronics. One charge seems to last forever even with heavy usage.  Ive kept it in a purple cover I got from Bu0026N and after approx. a year. the nook looks brand new. .Although I would stay away from their purple fabric cover. beautiful but gets dirty SO easily. I absolutely love  my nook color. There are a few minor glitches. it has a tendency to be a little unresponsive if you have too much on it and the web browser isnt so great. The only major problem Ive had with it is the fact that the ability to hilight is unpredictable and difficult. That is why Im selling mine to upgrade to an Ipad. I recently started taking courses and need something I can underlinehilighttake notes on. and while the Nook Color is an EXTRAORDINARY ereader. it was not created for either of those purposes. If what you are looking for is a color ereader that is comfortable in the hand. with a bright screen and will use it primarily for *reading* then this is a great investment!,5,1,1409

A2BDENVIRDTXVP,0,I use this recorder every day to make notes and record todo items while driving. etc.  It works very well and the recording quality is decent enough for what I use it for.  There is one large design flaw. though.  The  record button is MUCH too easy to press.  At least 4 times a week. Ill try  to record a message only to find a 70+ minute recording of me walking  around with this in my pocket.  All I do is delete that message and Im  back in business. but its annoying.,4,1,473
A2BDW3OMF1Z13E,57,I love this little device. It was so easy to install and was even easier to put it into my computer or at a kiosk. I just keep the parts in my purse so that way I know where it is when I need to take it out of my phone.,4,1,219
A2BENTCRKZ8UA9,0,USD800.00 for a little computer?  Thats crazy!  Especially when you can buy a lowend laptop for about the same price and have alot more functionality.  Forget the small size.  The Small size cant compensate for the lack of compatibility with all Microsoft Office Products.  This product is  overpriced. incompatible. and a big waste of time.  Grab a Palm Pilot for  13 the price of this and you get the same functionality as this product  and less headache.  By the way. if you want color. wait for the Palm IIIc  due out later this month.,2,0,539

A2BGP1MN2YD332,0,The 280SLK is very feature rich. but Motorola changed the headset plug so no other headsets work with this model. And nobody yet makes a earbud WVOX .there is a Motorola earbud WPTT.. Sound is clear as long as it is line of  sight. Residential housing quickly eats talk distance. but I was able to  converse an amazingly long distance in both a several mile greenhouse  complex. and thru many floors of the Circus Circus hotel in Las Vegas. I  would say this is the best product for family communication at amusement  parks. And the multiple levels of product mean you can get Dad a heman  Distance model. Mom a TA280SLK. and child the barginbasement  u0026quottalkaboutu0026quot .though I would get child the Talkabout+ for the LOCK  feature..,4,1,744
A2BGSZL3EOJNC7,3030,Good ereader. mediocre or bad at everything else. MAgazines leave much to be desired. the screen is too small to read them similar to how a book is read. which makes hte whole experience annoying.As an ereader. this is brilliant. but for any other task. it can be more of a headache than anything. the PDF reader it has is utterly useless. you cant save a page you are on. and it fails to open 50% of PDFs I come across. the music player is awkward and this is amplified by the small volume control buttons. using it on the internet can be a huge headache as well. the screen is either too small for many websites. or larger than neccesary for mobile websites.given the lack of any android market. or other similar stuff. I would not buy this again.,3,0,749

A2BI6VIUCOC6R1,0,Buyer Beware  When I purchased my Nook Colour I used my Amex credit card which is registered in the Philippines as I live in the Philippines.  No one at that time advised me that I would not be able to download any emagazines. is this deliberate deception on behalf of Bu0026N? What shortsightedness by Barnes and Noble  preventing its customers from giving it money using its product. which reduces the Nook Color to just a Wifi device that works in North America.,3,0,465
A2BJ6X0E3XBGHE,28,Great AM radio. add a Terk AM antenna and you have excellent AM reception. Got both today for a Christmas gift. couldnt be happier.My only complaint is the looks. It looks like it was made in 1964 by a couple of hippies. However. it plays great. has great sound. and will readily get station hundreds of miles away. With the Terk antenna. and some descent weather conditions. I should be getting stations thousands of miles away. I have not done a lot with it in the ways of moving it to different areas of the house. but I am very satisfied so far.I would recommend this combo to anyone.,4,1,588
A2BJAHI049H3FW,33,The plug fits into my camera but nothing charges at all. It is totally useless to me as it is.,1,0,94
A2BJV1B4QCKF2D,0,I needed a label maker for a job at work. and this one was on sale. I used it. I like it. and I would recommend it. The only drawback is the price of the tape. It is a bit steep. but not prohibitive. I used all of the cartridge that came with the unit. and a part of a new. full cartridge. and I had no problems at all.,4,1,319
A2BLA7WV1PHP9W,89,I didnt know that it didnt have android or Google.  I have to buy all apps. Other than this my son enjoy it. Also theres no customer service.,2,0,141
A2BLITJITO97N5,1,If you love AM radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios. the ccradio plus and the GE Superadio. These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk. sports. Art Bell. Phil Hendrie. etc. Which one should you buy? I have both .the GE for my office. ccradio for home. so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night. you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away .some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live.. There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer. accurate digital tuning. automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time. scan buttons. lighted dial. power cord .not bulky adaptor.. weather radio .with auto alert.. memory buttons. tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the .USDUSD. for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary  and inaccurate  tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations  it is that inaccurate. There is no timer. no alarm. no weather. no tv audio. no lit dial. etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio. though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably wont make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized  it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station. get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great. almost legendary. reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand. if you love radio. need the extras. change stations a lot. want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime. want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there. go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception .see their website to order.. I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day .as some people have tv going on all day.. I sleep to radio .and need that sleep timer.. I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast. Phil Hendrie. and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me. do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You wont regret it. P.S.. the FM reception will be better than you are used to. also.Bottom line. The GE superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky. The CCradio plus is expensive. has every extra you could want .except a decent handle.. more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the GE for music.,5,1,2917
A2BLITJITO97N5,3714,This is ok if you just want a cheap. portable radio but the reception leaves a lot to be desired. Many AM stations that are easy to get on my other radios were nonexistent on this.,3,0,180
A2BLITJITO97N5,1515,I have had this for a week and it is the best radio I have ever owned. It is portable and fits very ergonomically friendly into you hands. There are 40 memory presets. The BIG shortwave broadcasts .BBC. Radio Canada. Voice of America. came in very clear and those are really the only ones worth listening to on a regular basis as most of shortwave is flooded with religious programming and politically slanted news.  FM reception is very good and AM is about as good as my other radios. The dial light and LCD readout could be stronger and bigger. It comes with an adaptor. Sleep timer and alarm works just fine. Has two times .for GMTUTC and local time.. It looks great with its platinum case. I highly recommend this. It costs more but if you love radio and want BBC and VOA. this is the one to get.,5,1,801
A2BLITJITO97N5,78,This is the only shirt pocket size shortwave radio worth buying. For this great price you get a pocket radio without any drift .meaning the station you listen to wont change to another station because of a loose or faulty dial.. great stereo FM on headphones or ear buds .the buds that come with it are OK. Buy a better set and get ready for great sound.. good AM reception. and Shortwave reception that is adequate for the big international broadcasts like BBC but poor for most everything else. The speaker is only good for talk radio. For music. this is a tinny and tiny speaker .about one inch wide.. If you want a pocket radio that also gets BBC. Radio Canada. and Voice of America. this is the trick. Listen in on good earplugs and you will be happy with your purchase. It also has a good vinyl case. The radio looks sturdily built and will probably last for years.,4,1,871
A2BLREPS8JWOJ4,11,My most recent purchases u0026quotThe Matrixu0026quot and u0026quotHeatu0026quot have had nothing but skipping and freezing.  The picture skips around while the audio fads out.  Acts kind of like a VHS tape that has been twisted .the  film inside the tape. until it eventually freezes.  I like Panasonic  products but I wouldnt buy another one of their DVD players for this  reason.  I bought one other for a Christmas present .at the same time I  purchased mine. and it has the same issues.  My roomate has a Sony which I  asked him to play both of these movies and he didnt experience any  problems with both movies.,1,0,618
A2BM2RBEPZEQY1,33,Why waste your time trying to make your Windows PC do what it was never meant to do.  I looked at this board and then decided to get a Mac instead.  Since then. I havent looked back.  The Mac comes with the necessary consumer software to start making awesome video out of the box.You can add sound. special effects. transitions. etc... There are even plug ins from third partys for additional effects.  If you outgrow iMovie. you can always get Final Cut Pro.Get a Mac.,1,0,469
A2BMK1KKB555AO,123,The graphic on the page listing the cable clearly shows a CD with the title  USB Data Cable Driver . The package came without the CD.

A2BO4N86Q0PEE,0,Great choice if you want the quailty of a full size audio cassette. but want to be able to tuck it into a music bag or backpack.  My daughter uses this recorder to tape voice exercises as well as lectures.  Great quality  for the price.  Cannot go wrong with this one!,4,1,268
A2BOK1SNGBYFY0,1818,I have had my Coolpix 950 for almost a yest now.  I bought it here. on amazon.com. and Im still amazed.  There are so many things you can do with it!  I bought a 32 mg memory card and some rechargable batteries. too.  .Well worth it!.  The 32 mg is enough for me.  I take my pictures at the second highest level becuase I noticed no difference.  I almost waited for the 3 megapixal camera...but there is no need to get one unless you like to print pictures that are poster size.  Ive printed 5x7s that look great and I should try an 8x10.  It is so handy to have around and its great to use with people who are constantly closing their eyes and ruining photos.  Ive looked at other cameras and havent found quite as many u0026quotfun thingsu0026quot on them as this one!  Spend a little time researching before you buy to make sure you know what you want. dont spend too much or too little  depending on preferences.  Also. check Nikon for any rebates! .I got USD100 back from them.  My only complaint is the door that closes over that card. its cheap.  It pops open when I change batteries.  Everything else is SUPERB!,5,1,1119
A2BOZ3T20Q6HKQ,1717,It did what I wanted. I had many older story ideas on disk from a old word processor. so now I can go back and review them!,4,1,123

A2BQBEOOKUX8B6,0,It does work and stayed stuck to the glass. Just make sure you clean with alcohol and make sure it is completely dry. The range is poor but if you just need it for following others in the woods or road trips its perfect. but dont expect to talk over a mile and obviously get it tuned with a SWF meter. Make sure if you have window tint that it is not metalized as it will throw off any window mounted antenna. 3Stars for the range.,3,0,431
A2BQYESLWPVSCI,0,This is exactly what we needed to get my computer and printer online and working at the office.,4,0,95
A2BR4EP39WRY4G,0,I like the cover a lot...Ive been waiting for a cover like this since I got the Kindle.  I cant find notepads this size. though. so Im hoping Moleskine makes them available....at a price that doesnt make me laugh out loud.,4,1,222
A2BR9JLSF786KN,3,In todays world of shelf system stereos and boomboxes. the radio tuner component is usually an afterthought in system design.  As a result. radio reception is generally not a priority. and AM reception is dismal. at best.  The Superadio series is just what its name implies. sensitive reception and good sound reproduction.  Its not stereo. but the positive aspect of that is that instead of a pair of junk speakers. you have a single good quality unit.  Great for kitchen. workroom. garage. etc.  A real bargain!,5,1,513
A2BRHKQ9ZZOPQL,55,This is a good product.  The charge lasts a long time.  The only problem with them is they are a little bigger than nonrechargable 9 v batteries and are very hard to put in to our hand held mics.,4,1,195
A2BRM56W7F6CN3,0,After using the original natural keyboard. I was excited to get one at work.  Unfortunately. they purchased a NK Elite.  Its a perfectly fine keyboard...if you never use the function keys. arrow keys. or the alternate  .pgup. pgdn. etc. keys.  I realize that MS felt the need to scrunch  everything down to fit the keyboard into regular sized keyboard trays. but  this thing is just plain awful.  Only purchase if you dont touch type.  Go  for the Natural Keyboard Pro instead.,1,0,477
A2BRWT4QA3X8HC,88,This is a really great item. priced good and in good working order.  Arrived in tip top shape and in a timely manner.  I LOVE IT !,4,1,130
A2BSG5FF6T0XA,0,I have had these for almost two years and I have found that they do not hold up well.  The padding in the ears has flattened totally making them very uncomfortable.  The headphone cord has become stiff so that I have to bend it away from my face.  The biggest problem that has developed is creakyness.  The headphones creak anytime you move.  The creaking is loud and unpleasant and resonates inside the headphones.  If you are trying to wear them while sleeping on a plane the creaking sound is very disturbing.The noise cancelling is good on a plane and the sound is good considering the price.  However I would not buy them again because they have aged poorly.,2,0,663

A2BV98QZKHJX2I,2830,For those who are looking for a great little portable iPod dock with speakers. heres your answer. I use this little wonder when I go camping. great in the shower rooms or at home in your bathroom. Also looks good on your desk at work and it doesnt take up much room. The sound quality is not bad for a little device like this. granted its not a stereo with top of the line speakers so dont expect it sound like it. Its easy to store. fold up and can fit in your jacket pocket or purse. So for all you iPod owners take a closer look at it. you wont be disappointed.,4,1,564
A2BVHN6ZAXAN01,0,I expected to get something new...not something someone had returned to you. It was not factory wrapped as would be expected. I suspect your having a hard time finding the radio you advertised and still list. I ordered 3 on Oct. 9th and to this day I have only received two. This second one that was unwrapped had a smashed control knob and the battery pack will have to be taped to hold it closed. I must say with this purchase I am not satisfied with Amazon.....My question is how long will I have to wait for you to find radio 3????,3,0,535
A2BVS0RZJLQPPW,3,Bought as I thought it would be nice to have a pointer for my iPad. Was disappointed with the purchase. It does work with the touch screen. but you have to push pretty hard so it doesnt make it practical to actually use. Think you get what you pay for with this purchase.,2,0,271

A2BXHMAN1MVNVS,0,purchased these for a multi day trip to whistler with a group of 6.  since we didnt feel like paying for cellphone service in Canada. this seemed like a great alternative. in conjunction with some older motorola talkabout 289s that I had laying around.These are original motorola products. and have a secure clip on the back that we found will grip to whatever we fastened it to.  its quite convenient to have just the speaker outside of a pocket. and the rest of the radio and cord inside.  pushbutton talking. and a nice loud speaker made it great for snowboarding. especially when it was blizzardlike conditions and visibility wasnt the best.,5,1,645
A2BYF8QBX5I8EK,1516,I had to go through a u0026quotMacu0026quot retail catalogue to find a USB adapter to connect the PALM Vx to my iBOOK. It would have been nice if 3Com offered one through AMAZON. Hope when I get delivery tomorrow it all works.,1,0,226
A2BZF2XIGC1VU1,311,Ive had these headphones for several months now and until today had trouble getting them to stay put on my head and in my ears.  Well. duh.  It turns out that what appears to be merely a visual design element actually functions to hold the phones in place.  After putting the phones on I happened to slide the headband further back on my head and realized that the top part of my ears slide into the curved part of the headband just above the speakers. making them stay put on my head and helping to keep the speakers inside my ears.  The sound is much better now. pretty decent for this type of headphone. and they stay put when Im moving around.  Im going to order another pair to keep on hand when I invariably lose these.,4,1,725
A2BZNMPV1FDG9T,0,I got this got a new kindle fire hd owner who LOVES yellow. The case is nice for price. it does what it has to do but the smell at first is very unpleasant. Im glad it arrived fast and I had time to leave it out of plastic for a few days  to air out till smell went away.,4,1,271
A2C0L77SWTXMOV,0,After reviewing all the available mounts. double checking the whole patterns on the back of the TV. I decided this was my best option. It arrived in about 3 days. even though it said 7 when I ordered it. It took me about 20 minutes to install it. The package with the bolts and mounting hardware was very abundant with many sizes for length and thread size. I am certain that anyone else that is looking at this mount will be able to adapt it to there TV. It is very sturdy. stout. universal and simple to install. I say buy it!!,5,1,529

A2C2OYVOOKPCKT,0,After bolting the cable to the wall. I attempted to set the combination. In order to choose the combination you want. you use a flat head screw driver to unscrew and loosen the lock so you can rotate the number dials. Then. just tighten it up again. I did this. However. when I went to test out the combination I set. it didnt work! And when I went to unscrew it to reset it. my attempts at unscrewing the cheap screw stripped the head and I was unable to reset it. I called the company and they said they would replace it but only if I sent them the old one. Now I have to spend my time and my money to get a cheap lock replaced. And. based on the other reviews of locks spontaneously changing combinations anyway. I wouldnt be surprised if this happened again.,1,0,762

A2C4N3KROL6WA2,0,I recently purchased my second Sony ICFS79V to replace the first one I purchased almost seven years ago!  Thats right...  my first Sony ICFS79V lasted almost seven years which is why I had no problem replacing it with the same model.  The reason why I had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time.  The second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid  wet conditons.  I would totally recommend this product because it looks great. last a long time. gets great reception. a huge amount of digital presets and much more!,5,1,713
A2C4Q7OY4YOK9Z,22,When I first saw this sub. I wasnt sure how good it would be for such a cheap price.

A2C7RYJH9B2Z5F,0,I ordered this item for use in our family room in our new home. where for some reason the builder didnt think to include a phone jack.  Once we installed the wireless jack. we began to get intermittent buzzing on the line each time a call was made or answered.  Thinking it may be the phone. we ordered a different type of phone. but found the same issues remained.Unfortunately. between ordering the new phone and going on vacation for two weeks. we went a few days past the 30 day return policy and now Amazon is refusing to accept out return.  Interesting because the seller. TNT said they follow Amazons return policy so they dont want to help either.  It seem because we made an effort to try and make this jack work properly. we are stuck with a purchase we cant use.  Thanks Amazon and TNT for your understanding!  Last time I make a purchase from either company.,1,0,870

A2CAFCESCL3KWL,5656,After a few seconds. the process was complete  not sure if it worked. Did not see any difference in the player.,3,0,111
A2CAG1T0OVH2G7,1,I installed a handheld mike cb in the huntingfishingmountain recon vehicle a couple years ago.  It went together easily and performs well.

A2CARFAX5FNQT9,12,The very best tape to be encountered.  Highly recommend them because they are the BEST.,5,0,87
A2CBCMXGTUFF0F,22,I bought these to use with my 2way radios while hunting with my buddies. Obviously. I didnu00268217t want to hear any noise from the radios that could potentially spook the animals. For my purposes. this product works as designed. As others have mentioned. the earpiece slips out of your ear pretty easily. So if youu00268217re moving a lot. it will likely pop out. The clip that attaches to your clothing stays in place. but itu00268217s a bit awkward if you have it underneath your jacket to try to clip it to the collar.The other complaint I have is that the push to talk button is literally right next to the microphone. Being out in the cold. I had to take my gloves off every time I wanted to push to talk. otherwise my fingers would cover up the microphone.It seems like a change in design is needed. Newer earbud style speakers with a better clip and better positioned PTT button would be nice in 2013. But this same model first introduced in 1999 is all I could find. For USD10. it is OK and did the job.,3,0,1013
A2CC0RUPJIL2YE,0,Frankly. I didnt expect to like this as much as I do! I expected it to look a little cheap and maybe sound that way too. but when it arrived .in 3 days!.. I was very pleasantly surprised.  Even if I had had more money to  spend on a more expensive system. I doubt if I could be happier than I am  now with my new RCA! It has great sound and a sleek. sophisticated design.  You cant go wrong with this one!,5,1,405
A2CC2CRU24E44X,4042,I have to say that Ive grown very dependent on my IIIx.  Id give it a score of 5 except for the streaking problem.  Mine didnt do this right away.  It started hapening about 6 months after I began to use it.  Sometimes its there sometimes it isnt.  When its there. the streaking  .looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing. can make the  screen totally unreadable.  Five minutes later. all can be fine.  PDA need  to be dependable.  Mine isnt always.  Before I started reading other  reviews. I thought mine was just broken.  I was considering buying another  but not if by luck. I get another u0026quotstreakeru0026quot.  Even though I like  the IIIx. its reasonably priced .though still expensive.. has great  software options. Id be cautious about buying another one.  Probably  wouldnt go with the IIIx if I had known about the streaking problem in  advance.,3,0,875
A2CC9R0KDGDFQP,5555,Great CB for light use.  I love that it doesnt have a whole box to mount.  Makes it possible to install discretely without tearing up your dash.  And I love having the weather band.My only gripe is that there is not a black cap to put over the silver portable antenna outlet for a cleaner look when its mounted in a vehicle.  I have tried to find something to put over it and I keep striking out.  Maybe somebody can suggest something?,4,1,435
A2CDC1TJIX8E1U,0,it arrived on time and worked out of the box.  Obviously used but the application is for old equipment.,4,1,103
A2CEG7WRGNTCCW,0,I bought this thing before I had any knowledge of what a good piece of audio equipment was. I only had this for about 3 months until it stopped working. Everything was lighting up but when I tried to play a CD or an audio tape or listen to the tuner. there wasnt any audio. The RS1249 had a warranty but it cost me USD60 to ship it back to Texas. That was about half of what I paid for it... not cool. I took about 3 weeks to get my replacement for it. In less than a year. that one was total busted as well. It started making weird noises when I opened and closed the CD tray. Then it would occasionally become stuck and I had to apply force to close it until it finally would almost never close. I even had one of my good CDs get stuck in it and I had to take it all apart to get my CD out. When I looked inside. mostly everything that could be plastic WAS plastic. Plastic against plastic doesnt work very well... I speak from experience. Also. in the time that it did work. it would pick up radio signals even when it wasnt set to tuner. It would even pick them up when it was turned off. When I went to bed. I would have to unplug it because it would pick up stations and randomly go on and off with them. The RS1249 also puts of distortion when it is turned off or not being used but it isnt very obvious. Dont waste your money on this piece of garbage. Go out and buy a system that has a receiver and separate CD player or tape deck. If you have to get a book shelf system for space or money reasons. do yourself a favor and dont buy this product,1,0,1553
A2CHTG67P5DZZ4,44,Overall this product was ok. There was alot of static and I had to turn the Squelch up so much I missed conversation. Also. the rechargeable battery pack had a piece missing. The controls on the reciever were ok. they could have been backlit for night time driving. And the lcd screen should have the option to stay lit all of the time.,2,0,336
A2CJEN2XEDJA61,35,I was surprised to see some of the reviews that complained about size and cost.  This unit is extremely compact and. I think. reasonably priced.  Its exactly what I need when I take my Palm overseas.  I highly recommend it.,5,1,223

A2CL877NWLUPHV,35,Ive installed this antenna per manufacturer specs and tuned using my SWR meter.Performance of this antenna is worse than bad. It looks nice. the hardware quality is poor. The performance is even worse.In openhighway tests. I was able to to QSO about a eighth of a mileno more.,1,0,276
A2CLD5FSSXMYBT,1217,I ordered one of these from Palm shortly after I got my Palm IIIxe.  Unlike what other reviewers have said. my unit fit snugly. as expected.  I found. though. that within a few days. the clip had broken. and the case could swing in just about any direction but upsidedown.  I could tell that something had broken off. but I didnt have the expertise to fix it u0026amp resew the leather.  So I sent it back to Palm for a refund.Now my Palm stays in my pocket.  It makes it a little more vulnerable in some situations. but it beats using this case.,1,0,546
A2CLEYZ9KM9VML,14,Dont be fooled this is not an android tablet like the android phones. You cannot go to the market and get free apps. You still have to go through Barnes and Noble. You have to use their browser. I bought it so I could use it for school but I cannot download mozilla. I called tech support and all they said was sorry. Basically its an updated version of the nook color. You have more space. Everything I do on the nook table I did on the nook color. If you are wanting to get an android device where you can go to the market or amazon market do not buy the nook table.,3,0,568
A2CMIUEMMSGT8O,24,it is getting harder to find anything connected with cassette tapes.so being available on amazon is of course the best way to go.the pricing is also hard to beat...it was a few more cents than the old one I had for about 910 years.having amazon backing up allproducts is also a plus as far as I am concerned.for hard to find items I go to amazon first.very satisfied.....john w. fletcher,4,1,387

A2CPMEMCCRFAPW,0,After 18 months of treating this camera like gold and being reasonably satisfied with the quality of the images .as long as they werent enlarged.. one day it just stopped working with the lens partially extended. frozen in place. All the repair shops want USD100 to fix it. For USD100 I could buy a new one. It was cute while it lasted. but Ive bought a Yashica T4 .the original  not the awful zoom remake with the same name. instead. Its not nearly as small. but this elph is just too fragile.,1,0,494
A2CQC1UQ7E2YPU,13,These tapes worked nicely in my old JVC camcorder. They did make a bit of noise when recording and playing back. though. For some reason other tapes didnt do this. But it was a very faint sound. and I am happy.,4,1,210

A2CTBK9W1K01W7,0,be honest . if you buy this .CB transceiver radio. youre going to need a miracle to make if work. i tested with my girl friend.as soon as i walk away 50 meter  from her. i couldnt heard anything and get any signalim not sure how can people give 5 star review to this product.maybe they all use the external antenna to get better signal.sorry to say that not what i want. i use to have a motorola walkie talkie. work better that this like 100X time.sorry midland CO. im not try to destroy your reputation. quality is what we want.,1,0,529

A2CV7XFANHIRBF,0,After reading the reviews for this is I wasnt sure about whether to buy or not.  The CD player in my 07 Altima would not play CDs.  The problem is that the cleaning process is on track 2 and if your player wont work....how do you get to track 2?  I had read that when putting a CD in a car player. try to hold the CD as horizontal as possible.  After about 10 failed attempts. the CD played and cleaned the player.  Everything is working fine.  I highly recommend this CD.,5,1,472
A2CVNEE0H2F1YE,0,it does what I wanted and is a backup to my original one as these are virtually unobtainable with the USB lead in Europe. It was expensive but I could find no alternative.,4,1,171
A2CWMPK1YPVTG5,0,It works well in my Galaxy S4.  My only issue was the fact that it only has 29G of storage space.  That should be in the description.,4,1,133
A2CWX2Y6404P3,0,This product did not charge well. It takes hours by hours to charge my cell phone.I had to find the new one at the ATu0026T store.,1,0,130
A2CX45Q5PU5K1Z,0,Works. fit for ASUS was good. length was good. no complaints.  Good Value for the money. a must have to use apps like white board on your tablet.,5,0,145
A2CZ9VW3N6UWEL,11,As a previous reviewer wrote. its tapewhat else is there to say?  This size is very convenient for labeling lots of things around the house. DVDs. CDs. cables. boxes. drawers. The blackonwhite type is very easy to read. and the adhesive works well. My only gripe. and its minor. is the fiendish amount of dexterity required to separate the label from its backing. Not for the easily frustrated or those with 10 thumbs.,5,1,418
A2CZBKWSR3SGJB,46,The Rio PMP300 is a great portable system if you have access to your own computer. Some advantages are that its very small. very light. it doesnt skip. It only takes 1 battery which runs for at least 10 hrs. and the music can be free on the internet. You can also take tracks right off your  favorite CDs. The 1 problem that I have with it is that it only holds 32 MB  which is about 7 or 8 CD quality songs. It could hold more if you dont  mind radio quality. If you want to get more memory on this thing its not  cheap. You can double your memory from 32MB to 64MB for about USD100. I am  going to wait for the price to go down before I buy more memory for mine. The  software that it comes with is pretty good too. I also like the overall  design of the buttons and player. It has a Hold option. 5 different  Equalizers. Replay and Random modes. and a cool A~B feature which is  pointless fun to play with.,4,1,909
A2CZZ2T6Q1EHYM,5759,Cable does what I need. no problems.  I got a good price and was able to order this from a company I trust. no complaints here.,5,0,127
A2D0AM9X7LRHND,33,For all the hype...this tablet is making me miss my old Sony E reader. The touch screen is very jumpyif you arent careful it will skip around in your book. Also. twice I have had items download that I did not purchase. nor even look at. Customer service is impossible to get a hold of. I have sat on hold for 30 minutes plus to get help. and it is impossible. Also. contrary to their claims. you cannot use a Bu0026N gift card to purchase Ebooks. Also. the Bu0026N membership does not apply to Ebooks. They do not offer as many free options as the Sony E reader or the Kindle. Wish we would have waited and bought something different.,1,0,634
A2D15X9E5GMQY7,922,This player is the benchmark standard of all DVD players.  Read a review of this player in Stereo Reviews Sound u0026amp Vision.  Every other player is measured against this piece.  The video is superb. especially hooked up  with the component video outputs. and the audio is amazing.  As far as the  downsampling goes. Sony was simply complying with the manufacuring standard  of the industry which did not want to allow a digital bitstream passing out  of the player at 2496.  That is why it is downsampled to 48!  Additionally. if you have DACs in your system that are better than the ones  in this Sony. you should be looking higher. like at a Lexicon or a Meridian  player.,5,1,678

A2D1U27937CQQB,12,Ive had the Labtec C322 Stereo HeadsetBoom Microphone for a couple of years now. and have had the same experience as with other Labtec equipment.  They just dont hold up to normal wear and tear.On this particular piece of equipment. the left speaker has begun to rattle and pop.  Its blown.The slide mechanism that maintains the size of the headphones on your head broke withing a month or two.  Flimsy plastic tabs just dont make for durable equipment.If you want a throwaway model of headphone. buy these ...  otherwise. look elsewhere.,2,0,538
A2D2C6X8G98QVQ,1,I had shopped around for a DVD player for quite awhile and had recomendations for the Sony and Toshiba models. I was just looking for a VCR replacement so I didnt need any specical features. at least not yet.  Since I already used other Sony products .stereos and TVs.. I chose the  Sony S330 and I havent been disappointed yet.It was easy to install. I  pulled it right out of the box with the patch RCA cables and SVideo cable  and was able to watch a movie in a couple of minutes. I can always set that  up with my stereo later when I had the time. If youre looking for a DVD  player to get you started. Id definitely recommend the S330. I havent  rented a video tape since.,5,1,677
A2D2FTNV4L6S0Q,1718,As I said in my velcro review. this allows me to satisfy my OCD need for color coordination.  It comes with plenty of colored tape to identify your cord with the outlet. but I also got colored velcro ties to organize my cords as well.,5,1,234

A2D4GWXQOGXLQD,11,My experience with this device has been nothing but wonderful. The battery life is amazing once you tweak with the settings .ie. turning off wifi. adjusting screen brightness and duration or sleep mode.... the touchscreen can be less than hyper responsive at times but it doesnt get in the way of reading at all and wiping it off with my sleeve always gets it working again. I love that it can be updated without much effort and the library management system that barnes and noble uses is quite good.Honestly this device has all the pros of a kindle with one major upside. The ability to load documents and free ebooks far far far exceeds the kindle. My great aunt wrote a novel before she passed away and had a microsoft word document copy. With the help of some free software. I was able to convert the file and load it onto my nook in a matter of minutes! My sister has a kindle and could not figure out a way to load it onto her device. I have an extensive library of free books and since I can purchase ebooks from anywhere. I have more choices than the kindle.Ive had the device for a year now and I have never had a problem with it freezing. losing my place or being unfairly slow to open. The page turning has never been an issue either.,5,1,1245
A2D4LOQCMT8H7O,33,I ordered this despite seeing from recent comments that there was no more than a 50% chance of it reading my old floppy disks.  It didnt.  I called the support line. was on hold for maybe 10 minutes. and was told that the drive only reads 1.44Mb floppy disks. i.e. it does not read 720Kb or 2.88Mb floppy disks.  If you can remember that all your old floppies are 1.44Mb then maybe this will work... or maybe it wont.An interesting aside is the support guy wanted me to see if the drive would format a blank disk.  Really?  They think I am seriously going to start saving data on floppy disks again?  Thats amusing when you think about it.Note. my PC is Windows 7 and the plugandplay driver installed without issue. i.e. it worked as intended.  My guess is the operating system is irrelevant.I wouldnt buy this unless you can return it for gratis.,1,0,847

A2D9R9YS04I05,0,This little gadget does away with the biggest complaint most folks have with a Palm  you can enter data quickly without Graffiti. I learned the aforementioned curse of data input back on a Newton MessagePad. so Im very used to it and rarely hit a wrong stroke. But I still love having this as an option for jotting down quick thoughts. whether its at the table in the breakfast room while listening to support voicemail. or on a ferry to the Outer Banks for a few days off. I have carried and typed lots of data with this little guy. in places that a laptop or the larger foldout keyboard would not be as easy to use. Sure. the keys are smaller .duh!. and the layout is not exactly the same as a desktop 105key. And my Corolla is not an SUV! For what its intended to be. this gadget is tops.

A2DC11ZBTHH67X,3537,After having used this headphone for a little over a year it has become virtually unusable. The plastic parts started creaking very soon. What seemed to be tolerable in the beginning has become ridiculous now. It is triggered by the slightest movement of the head. the jaw or even by taking a deep breath and sounds like an old skiboot right on your ear.The shells do not encompass the ears but rather sit on the outer rim of the earlobes. And no. I dont have extremely big ears. Thats simply how this headset was designed. Watching an entire film on a plane leaves you with hurting ears. The noise reduction is very good but Id rather go nuts from the engine noise than wear the Sony MDRNC20 for the duration of a transatlantic flight.The sound quality with noise canceling switched off is feeble and thin. However with the noise canceling on very satisfactory.Update. Now the cable has come apart and one side of the headphones has gone mute. After careful usage for a little over one year the MDRNC20 is officially broken. I really wanted to love this thing and I treated it with more careful respect than anyone who actually takes their headphones on the road all the time. I will check out the Bose noise cancelers next...,5,1,1227

A2DE1BPU8QCNSD,2,I have had this changer for approximately 5 weeks. past the Amazon 30 day return policy. unless stocking charges and shipping costs are paid by me.  JVC will not exchange the unit but will repair it at their local authorized dealer.At first. there were seldom. random skips. garbles. and lyric repeats.  These have become more frequent and annoying.  Pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help.  My ten year old Yamaha changer. it has drawer problems. plays my discs flawlessly.So far. this is the only problem but a major one that is getting worse.  Everything else is working and I do like the unit.  The sound quality is superior to my old Yamaha and the remote is better.I do not know if this unit can be fixed or. like with cars. the repair people cannot duplicate the problem.I am not going to put a lot of time. energy. or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt.  Maybe DVD changers are made better and I can use one as a CD player?I am disappointed. to say the least. and from my experience. I know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble.  I hope your purchase goes better.Update. 12109I took the unit in for warranty repair.  They replaced the laser and on the technicians equipment. both analog and optical cable connections were tested. the unit played flawlessly.  On my home system with a new optical cable. I again had the original problems.  I gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection.  It must be a hand shake issue with my equipment so I no longer believe it is the unit itself.  I have read that some electronic equipment combinations do not always work well together.  I conclude that was my situation.,2,0,1739

A2DG5PXQTUAP6X,0,You really canu00268217t be this monitor for price. My previous 30u00268221 cost 1200USD. I was looking around for a couple of months trying to find a deal on a brand named monitor. but then I gave up and looked for a less popular brand. I am NOT disappointed.Pros. The monitor arrived 4 days after purchase. it was crystal clear with all pixels working. After I ran my u00268220Huey Monitor Color Correctionu00268221 tool. the colors did not even change much because they were already preset correctly.Cons.  The stand does not go up or down or tilts forward. This my only complaint. since I have a 3 screen setup I prefer them all to be the same height. Fortunately this monitor has the standard VESA mount holes on the back. so I just took the stand from my old Samsung monitor and put it on. worked like a charm. Also. the manual is only in Korean.Overall. I was really skeptical buying a no brand monitor. but for this price I can buy 2.5 Yamakasi monitors with the exact same specs for the price it would cost me to buy 1 Samsung or Dell. My recommendation is to get it. if you are on the fence because you donu00268217t know the brand. donu00268217t worry and go for it.,5,1,1177

A2DIB900B9YM6A,44,We recently had one VCR break down. then the picture went out on my other VCR. I was rather disappointed since it is difficult to find them these days. especially not connected to a DVD player .which we also have 2 of. so I dont need any more.. We decided to try cleaning it see if that would fix the problem. This is the first trouble we have had with this VCR in 10 years. When I received the tape cleaner. I put it in and it jammed at first. but I also had some issues with the VCR spitting the tape right back out and shutting off. So I restarted the VCR and played the tape. Seconds later. everything was back to normal  better even. It was quick and easy. I did tighten the tape up before replaying it the second time .after it jammed. because I think the shipping may have jostled the tape a bit and I think that is why it jammed. It worked great and it sure beat having to replace the VCR. I would suggest checking to see if the tape has unwound a little before putting it in. though. It seems like several people stated that it jammed when they started it and Im wondering if it is just prone to having a loose tape. Im a very contented customer. though.,5,1,1163
A2DICS3AIAR0JA,11,The only beef I have with this cable is the one I have will all PS2 extension cables  the ends become separated too easily.  Other than that its a great product. certainly as good as or better than its competitors.,4,1,214

A2DJHNJQA7B6LN,22,This product is excellent!! i have one for 3 years and  have never been happier.  When i upgraded to xp the softwear dis not work! so i did a bit of research. there is a program called music jukebox which you can download at ..... you download this program and then you go to settingsplug in manager and then handheld. it takes you o a site where you find the rio 500 and then download the plugin. after that it works great!! i have not had a problem with it since!! I hope this helps all the other people who have upgraded to windows xp and found themselves stuckThanks!!!,5,1,573
A2DLK5KEQU4TX9,33,Cord worked great for awhile. but had recently not been working up to snuff. Cant understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months. It should last a lot longer than that. Wont keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station. Switched back to the OEM cable. and what do you know? Its charging again.Definitely going to have to find a different cable.EDIT 1012013. Nope. the cable is fine. It works great as an OTG cable...I was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone. as well as add files to my Nexus 7. It was actually the cheaplymade USD9 Chinese charger I had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad. When I put this cable on my Nexus OEM charger. it worked just fine. I do believe Ill be purchasing another Nexus 7 OEM charger in the near future.,5,1,806

A2DNRQSHXAAU23,2,Being an ardent Olympus fan I was sold out by the advertisement hoopla  worlds smallest and technically advanced PS. I first bought the Epic dlx .fixed focus. camera. I was surprised by its superb performance and have been thoroughly enjoying it. Technically. no body can beat it quality optics. allweather construction. solid feel design and above all. its size. Later. I ended up with the 140 zoom camera and enjoying it even more. Wish these minis were out when I bought my first SLR. Olympus OMPC in the eighties. Being convinced by its performance. many of my friends have purchased these cameras as handy. second units for casual shooting.,5,1,645
A2DO7W6T2AZVU2,33,Just like any other camera. sometimes you get good pictures and sometimes you get bad pictures.  Most bad pictures can be attributed to u0026quotoperator erroru0026quot or bad lighting.  Yep. it chomps batteries. but other digital cameras use more than 2 at a time.  I had a Kodak  .DC40? .digital camera through work several years ago and it took only  about 25 shots on 4 batteries.  The pictures were very comparable to the  Agfas.  ....  As a video camera. it is absolutely fantastic.  The image quality is  *much* better than we expected for the money.  ...if .people want. a megafantastic. all the bellsnwhistles digital camera...theyd need to shell out a WHOLE lot more....,5,1,680
A2DODZ6PF8102K,2830,I bought these headphones at Walgreens to hold me over until I could get a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones from Amazon.  Thank goodness I only need them for a week.

A2DQ35M3HZ6PQW,11,I purchases the Sony DCRTRV103 Handycam just after my first son was born. and just after my VHS camcorder died.  I have used this camera extensively over the last 7 years. never have had a problem. until recently.  I have filmed several hundred hours worth of videos with great results.  Excellent pictures and quality sound.  Recently I have been getting an error message. telling me to eject the tape.  I am looking into to repair. but maybe after all this time it is ready to replace. but I would recommend a new one of these to anyone.,5,1,539
A2DQQIM2WHF2JJ,33,My wife and I bought a pair of these affordable FRS radios for our coasttocoast move .eight days in separate vehicles.. The radios seemed to have decent reception up to a mile. more if the terrain was flat. Rain and  power lines seemed to reduce range somewhat. The clarity was good enough.  though I think some of the higher priced radios are clearer. Also. I found  I pretty much had to turn the volume all the way up in order to hear  incoming transmissions a better speaker would be a definite improvement.  As for battery life. we got about 4050 hours of use before needing  replacement.  We found the CALL and SCAN features very useful as was the  ability to easily switch to a clear channel. The VOX feature worked ok with  the builtin microphone but there is a noticeable delay in activation that  we found annoying maybe it works better in conjunction with a  headset.For occasional use I would say the Midland 75507 is a good  choice.  I would not suggest buying the really cheap radios. typically sold  in pairs. which typically have just one or two channels as interference  with other users limits their usefulness.,3,0,1128
A2DRSIQVF603TO,1181,Awesome radio. Works great for my trail needs and more. Other friends on the trail have bought one after they have seen the compact size and good quality of this radio.,5,0,168
A2DRTUHS02NGOR,0,Great for use indoors and as a wireless puppy.  Useless in anything but dim light.Also. how can the Psion have a smaller form factor and better keyboard?

A2DUZZU3AFGVGE,0,I bought my Diamond Rio 500 a couple of months ago u0026amp I have really enjoyed it. but I have one major complaint.  It only comes with one page of very baisic instructions.  There were some very important functions that I  didnt even know about for about a month after I bought it. until I finally  found someone else on the net who was able to help me.  If you have a  Macintosh computer. then I would recomend this player to you over the other  players available for Mac OS because of the functions and the ease of use  after you get past the instruction problem. but I would not recomend buying  this if you dont know anybody else who owns one who can help you learn how  to use it.  Overall. I have to rate this player at 3 stars. but if it  wasnt for the instruction problem. I would probably rate the player at  about 4 12 stars.,3,0,838
A2DVTX6EMV8YT,11,I was very happy with this product when I first received it. but now I am finding that Olympus not only does not have availability for online problems .but you cannot talk to them even on the phone. I now have a camera that works great. but the connection to the computer is bad somehowI have made no changes to anything concerning the camera . but cannot connect to my computerit justs states reasons I dont understand as to what my problem might be. I cannot get any info from the online site or by callingthey are always giving you such a long waiting time. So now I have a camera that I cannot use in connection with my computer. No one seems to carry the serial cable  that I may need to replaceif that is even the problem. Poor servicing with this company.,3,0,762

A2DXC3PKBFPQDS,0,This little radio is feature rich the features just require you to be a half mile or less to the other radios. using the adapter to plug into my trucks antenna I didnt get that more range at the most maybe bumped the range up to a mile and thats it. This radio would be good for a vehicle that didnt have a cb permanent mounted or even a rental when going on vacations to get road reports from semis and to listen to the weather chanel on it. would also be good to have to and talk between two cars on a trip.,4,1,509

A2DXXJR0N8BXOK,2930,I purchased a NOOKcolor a couple of months after it came out.  Within a week I had to return it because it would not charge.  A lot of hassle was required to get a replacement and it took a couple of weeks to get to me.  Once I got it set up I used it about 7 times and it locked up on the home page.  It took 2 days of conversing with a tech before they finally decided to send me another replacement.  I received my 3rd one and it lasted exactly 43 hours.  Screen went black and the lower right corner heated up to the point it was too hot to hold.  This time they were nicer about agreeing to send me a replacement.  The 4th one is sitting. unopened. in a box in front of me.  Well. after having trouble with three of them I no longer feel I can trust this device to work consistently .unless you consider always breaking as a form of consistency!. and would like to get a complete refund.  So far Bu0026N .the site I bought it from. wont do that for me.Moral.s. of the story.1. Stick with a Kindle  I bought an early version of it and still love it.  And if you want color go wtih the Kindle Fire.2. Only buy products though Amazon since they are very lenient and curteous about returns.  .They werent selling the NOOKcolor when I purchased mine..Its now about a year later and Im still trying to get my money back.  My plan is to take this unopened box. all receipts and emails to a nearby Bu0026N store and hope pleading in person will get me a full refund.Wish me luck!,1,0,1476

A2E36XULD26LOK,0,I wanted to love this. I really did. I tried for 2 weeks. But I hated it. HATED it.1. The charger LOOKS like microUSB but it is not. Therefore. you must lug around a dedicated charging cord.2. The browser is not quite right. There are little things that just make it not good. Like when you click a link. theres no highlight or box to indicate you selected the link. And theres not way to open a link in a new window. And other quirks that I didnt know I appreciated in my other browsers until the nook took them away.3. Cant use android apps. or amazon apps. or ANY apps that arent dedicated to the nook. Seriously. how many formats are we going to ask our app creators to make. And the Bu0026N app prices? RIDICULOUS.I will be getting either a sony ereader .uses ACTUAL microUSB to charge. or a samsung galaxy .an ACTUAL tablet.. The nook tablet tries to be both and fails at both.,1,0,883

A2E4VJJETCSH7U,0,I purchased the USB version of this unit and ran through the setup procedures without a hitch. When I started to use it . the trouble began. After many hours of frustration I called the technical support number and  was told by a rep and a supervisor that this device will not work if ANY  other USB device is used. This is unbelievable when you consider the entire  purpose of USB is to connect multiple devices to your computer! I was told  to disconnect my other USB devices .mouse. keyboard. scanner. printer. and  Palm Pilot cradle.. When they saw the problem with disconnecting the mouse  and keyboard .duh.. they told me to return it.,1,0,641
A2E5IK9TUH8UPD,2627,For the price. this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall. I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.,4,1,268
A2E5PF4X1RAJF7,0,Although the sound quality and features of this techniques receiver were very good. its venilation system is extremely poor and it gets very hot.  If you have your components in a cabinet. you will not be able to leave  this receiver on for very long.

A2E6UDYYIGBZPF,1,Im not a tech geek or anything. I was honestly expecting a little more. Reading. the nook is flawless. and does a great job. tablet navigation is a bit confusing. and not really user friendly as other tablets. I find that the nook is very SLOW at performing tasks. especially internet browsing. even typing. there is a delay from when you press the key till you see it on the screen. apps and stuff... are not free. and cost USDUSDUSD more then apps for any other platform out there.  It was bought for our child to promote reading via cool tablet.fyi ebooks can be bought for other tablets too. the only thing that makes this better is you can read in the daylight. thats it. ipad is so much better then this. even the kindle fire is much better then this thing. other then reading... there are better options out there.this review based on a nook color tablet owned for 2 months. brand new,2,0,891

A2E7IHO5DH3TG9,713,I just bought A120 Panasonic DVD player.

It stopped reading the DVD record.  I had  to turn it on and off. This solved the problem but after watching two or  more DVD movies. the problem started again giving me a message that a wrong  disc was inserted. Anybody else having the same kind of problem?

A2E96BE1W09VJN,0,Well i bought this before checking out the recommended cards from GoPro. So it arrived in the mail and i started using it in my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition Camera and of course i had a default. I returned the GoPro the first time and i believed it was the GoPros fault but now on the second one the GoPro is still not working so i called GoPro and told them and they said i should really just get a new SD card since this is not recommended from them and i have came to the conclusion that it is the cards fault. Now it doesnt mean the cards bad. Its just not good for the GoPro and i know other people have had problems with this card in the GoPro and some people havent but if your buying a card just for the GoPro i recommended getting one that GoPro recommends. Other then that its a good card.Eric,3,0,801

A2EA17B30OM0ZJ,0,I puchased this USB camera after getting my father a parallel port version of a Logitech Camera  the difference is night and day!  If your computer is old and doesnt support USB. get a PCI USB card .USD30.  I cant even  begin to explain the difference.  The picture from this camera is at least  10 times more clear. not to mention the increased sound quality during  videoconferencing.  A PCI USB card is PnP and required no additional  configuration and the camera plugged right in. perhaps the easiest  peripheral Ive ever added.  I was video conferencing with my father. who  lives in California. within 10 minutes.Were getting him a USB PCI  card and this camera ASAP.  Its a pain to switch the cables back and forth  and rebooting the computer so the printer will work. the transfer of data  is highly increased through USB. and USB takes up less system resources.  I  greatly underestimated the value of USB.  With the rebate. I bought the PCI  card and this camera at the same price as his Parallel Port Logitech  camera. but theyre not the same in terms of quality.  This is a must have!,5,1,1096

A2EBQEYEL7L3YB,0,I bought these binoculars to watch the birds in my backyard but failed to do sufficient presale research.  Their nearest focus point is probably 50ft and their magnification is generally higher than you would want.  So they are ill suited for my intended use. but that is my fault. not Bushnells.For viewing things further away they are fine.  They seem rugged and very solid. though I havent done much with them.  I like the rubberized housing.  The one general complaint I have is that the rocker focus mechanism has too much give in it.  You can rock it for a few degrees before it actually starts doing any focusing.,4,1,620

The index finger moves the ball u0026amp the middle finger fits perfectly for the main clicker.  The right clicker. which is not used as much is manipulated with the thumb.  I would not want to use my thumb more than that as it would cause cramping. Super comfortable hand fit. Movement is smooth!  And another really cool thing is NO MORE MOUSEPAD!!!  For someone .like me!. who has limited space that is a definate bonus!  It seems to be weighted perfectly to stay exactly where you place it. I am just very impressed.,5,1,638
A2EE13O55R2HMG,33,I bought a pair of motorola FR50s recently and the range is great.  These work just as great as a pair of Talkabouts can. but they were much cheaper.  They are very small. lightweight. and have just as many channels.  The only difference between the FR50s and the Talkabouts are minor  extras like VOX and scan feature.  Most people dont need those.  Do  yourself a favor and save yourself some money.,5,1,401
A2EF2TV9PUIKOO,4653,In the end I was able to get all my data off of my old floppy disks. It took a little time. though. The floppy disk drive gave me trouble each time I tried to eject and insert a new disk. Each time I had to disconnect the whole thing from the USB port. then restart the process from the start. I have a Macbook with Lion 10.7.5. not sure if that is meaningful. As mentioned. I was able to get all my data. so for the price it was a good purchase.,3,0,446

A2EHMCGXILOY7N,1,After exhaustive comparisons with the best DVD players out there. only one player could deliver the goods. with no digital artifacts. fastest and smoothest scanning. and for anamorphic widescreen. the chosen format for  today and the future. the Sony DVP7700 is the absolute reference. Not even  players at twice the price could reproduce home theater sound without  harshness. and bring all the dynamics and excitment like the Sony DVD  player.

A2EI3NGBDGE1FF,3336,Good design in some respects  convenient earphones for use while running. etc.. and convenient controls.  BUT  terrible reception!  Fine for local FM stations. but very poor sensitivity and even worse selectivity. both FM and AM.  Not a radio for someone who wants to pick up a particular station .e.g.. for my main purpose  listening to sports broadcasts.. but OK if you just want to listen to any local station for musical distraction while engaged in sports activity.,1,0,470
A2EIHE8CZA0PBF,55,I like this camera for its all around versatility and picture quality.  Ive used it in work. for art and for family funand its a good choice for all.The camera is small. light and easy to use on the job. I photo houses for insurance inspections. The zoom helps getting close ups. and the 28 mm wide angle is great for shooting the entire houseI dont have to move very far away. Likewise for landscape photos. sunsets. etc.The flash is very versatile. and can be turned off .with only a little trouble. to save batteries when not needed. The redeye reduction helps a lot for family shots.This new version is missing the very useful datetime stamppresent on the older model I use.The picture quality is probably not that of a professional SLR. but pretty close for most of the things I shoot.The camera seems quite durable.  I used it for 2 years occasionally for fun and art. and recently put it into professional service. It held up for 10 months with daily use2540 photos and being turned on and off 1015 times per daybefore it broke down.  I also dropped it several times. but it kept on ticking. It will probably last you a few more years. if you just use it for a family camera!,5,1,1182
A2EJ23DV7ZFT1X,2323,Purchased and returned the camera.  From an optical perspective and the quality of the images. quite a great camera. Considering the substantial cost. several items were very disappointing and caused me to return it on a  cost vs. benefit aspect.  1. The camera does not come with a recharger and  appropriate NiCad .or better. batteries. Regular alkaline batteries last  about 30 min. for normal use.  2. The connection to the PC requires a  serial port only. Would be a nice option to include USB hookup. My  computers serial ports are all used for other devices.  3. An 8MB flash  card that holds a mere 16 images in the normal mode. 4. When connected to  the PC. the pictures cannot be easily transferred to software programs that  can sort. package or send the pictures.  A cumbersome copy procedure has to  be utilized to get the pictures on the hard drive from there they need to  be imported to the software. Even with a 450 Pentium II machine. the  transfer was slow .even at the fasted speed setting for the serial port..  The instructions confirmed that photo software does not recognize the  camera as a device to copy from.  It should work just like a scanner .from  a systems perspective..I think the folks at Nikon have a great camera  here but need to work on making it more cost effective and user friendly.  To bring the camera up to speed a minimum of another USD200+ would have to be  invested. .Batteries. charger and larger flash card. The PC hookup could  be greatly improved and made more user friendly.  Considering the already  high cost this is not yet a good package. I was sorry to return it.,2,0,1621
A2EJAQH1LUHAZH,1432,I have had my nook for almost two weeks now and I am very happy with it. I have not had any problem with it except that it froze twice. I didnt mind because all I had to do was turn it off and on. In December. I was thinking twice about getting the Nook because I read many bad reviews. Im happy that I stuck with it because it is very responsive. It does not take long to go from one page to the next. it takes about the same time as turning a page on a paperback. The only thing that isnt so great is the battery... Im a heavy reader so I have to charge my battery every two to three days.if im lucky.. I wish that my battery did last 10 days as it is advertised. Overall. the Nook is very easy to use .read the manual first!.and it does its job well.,5,1,753

A2EN2B8QT6RV45,0,The W360R cassette recorder does everything that I want from a recorder. I am interested in recording long musical pieces from my FM radio amplifier. and with the W860R I can record up to 180 minutes using both tapes which meet my needs. Very few operas. oratorios etc exceed this time limit. and the few that do can be coped with by replacing tape I with a new tape.,5,1,367

A2EOZLWEXG9T7D,0,I first heard the FS series from JVC in Florida and when birthday time came. so did an FS2000. I immediately started a search for a suitable Subwoofer to enhance the system. I tried a u0026quotBassbiteu0026quot unit and  was very pleased at how perfectly matched it was. Since then I have  purchased several more subs for computers. The real plus is that JVC was  on the u0026quotcutting edgeu0026quot when they engineered the system with a  subwoofer output in the first place. Now you find several other brand  names that are marketing the same thing with their name on it. What a neat  form of flattery! The magnet structure of the speaker is as large as the  mounting hole opening. As JVC has made a few changes in newer models such  as the FS7000. the basic features are maintained. The speaker has received  such huge acceptance based on its performance that JVC is using it in their  boom box line with unmatched performance from competitors. I have demod  and highly recommended this unit to others for several years. I have found  no other product that I would rather have invested in.,5,1,1094
A2EP0WOZE8HCJX,44,i was actually pretty excited to get these. but when it arrived. it was defective. the monoculars didnt align. causing me to see double and 2 picture. not as one. also. there seemed to be a scratch of some sort on the right monocular. i tried to clean or blow it out to see if it was just an eye lash. but it never went away. i sent them back for a return.,1,0,356
A2EPAYUAQ8P78W,0,This radio has been good  I have owned several Sony showertype radios. and this units quality is among the best.  Very good sound. built very solidly. controls are easy to use and understand.

A2EUCXZ43C4TIW,515,The Nook Color is in great condition. but videos on YouTube do not sound right all the way through.  They will start out sounding good. then get slow and a little warbled. then get better towards the end.  Being already a rooted Nook. it may have something to do with that. but we are not real tech savvy people so we dont know.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. but that didnt help.  The same thing happens with some of the games as well.  If seller can provide me with some tips or instructions to remedy this. I will be glad to give her 5 stars.,4,1,559

A2EVAWAWCYV5BI,12,I ordered a new Samsung SGHa867 Charging USB 2.0 Data Cable for my phone. the item I received is old and not even in working condition. I am really dissatisfied from this purchase!!!,1,0,182
A2EVQ8S7FMLGL,0,I was a little hesitant to buy a minidisc player. because I already have  CDs. and portable CD players are cheaper.  However I really enjoy this  product.  First. its much more portable than a CD player. it easily fits  in my pocket along with my wallet and keys.  The discs are tiny and easy to  take along as well. and are conveniently stored in cases. so you dont have  to worry about them scratching.  Secondly. recording features are really  cool.  The digitaloptical line results in near perfect copying of CDs.  Ive also used a small clipmike to bootleg concerts .with the artists  permission!.. and as long as the sensitivity is turned all the way down. to  compensate for the loud noise. the quality is excellent.  2 12 hours of  mono recording is pretty cool. too.The other product this competes  against is MP3 players.  I think Minidisc is better suited for most people.  because to listen to different songs you can just put in a new minidisc.  you dont have to be near your computer and download new songs.  As  portable products are made for people on the go. this makes more sense.  And of course its still possible to record your MP3s to minidisc. it just  takes more time.I think the Sharp 722 is the best Minidisc in the price  range because of the lengthy battery life and the small. squarish shape.  The remote can be useful. and the jogwheel makes functions such as adding  and deleting tracks intuitive.  It comes with a digital cable. which is a  mustbuy for other recorders that dont come with one.,5,1,1523
A2EX8X14KY7E3U,2626,Ive owned a Palm V since Feb 99. In the last 56 months. the sensitivity of the screen has severely degraded. I have to write very carefully. or my Graffiti isnt recongnized. I also have trouble with other onscreen  controls. like scrolling or marking a checkbox. This has made the V very  difficult to use. Because it has worn out so quickly. I dont think Ill  replace it with the same modelIm going to look at the Handspings.On  the plus side. you cant beat the size of the V. Its very slim. fitting  easily and inconspicuously in the pocket of your pantseven your jeans .as  long as they arent slimfit!.. The recharging cradle is also a bonus. You  never have to think about batteries.,3,0,687
A2EXIVG4MVMA2X,22,these speakers are nice for someone who is in an office but they arent very loud. you turn them up and it sounds horrible. something is missing  from them.. not sure what. but what can you expect for USD8 speakers? I only  got them because it was all I had at the time. If you want some good  sounding speakers this is some that you  should definitly stay away from.,1,0,366
A2EXS73XZ8XGXH,23,This mic is light. comfortable. adjustable. and great for canceling background noises out.  What I think both the reviewers below are forgetting is that this mic was designed for speech recognition.,5,0,198
A2F01NCH47R16O,1414,Have only used it twice. but like anything else. you must be consistent in keeping your cds and dvds clean.,4,1,107
A2F0OIL5L9LAV2,0,I have never seen a better product similar to this one before. My cell phone battery lasts less time than my palm Vx. and yet it takes longer than with this charger. This charger. with average use. takes only about two minutes to charge. and syncs with the computer at blazing speeds. Great product!,5,1,299
A2F0TTEP4W354Y,55,This radio has very good sensitvity to FM. MW and Shortwave.  Its sensitivity is almost as good as my Grundig 400PE. but some of the other specs arent quite as good which I would expect for a receiver that is  about half the price of the 400 PE.  Its power consuption is better than  the 400 PE too.  Its smaller size .than the 400 PE.. very good designed.  easy to use controls. good sound quality along with an excellent read out  offers a good value.  I like this radios abliliy to quickly get to the  frequency I am interested in.  This is a fine little radio four stars.,4,1,575
A2F1XPTGEADV8R,1111,The product arrived on time.  It is sturdy heavy black metal. probably weighs almost as much as the 40  TV I mounted on it.  The instructions were somewhat unclear. especially the drawings. but if I had read them very closely. it would have been very easy to assemble and mount the TV.  This is a good product at a very reasonable price.  An added bonus is all the extra screws. etc that come with it to make it fit multiple sizes and makes of TVs.,4,1,448
A2F39UV9SZLT80,0,I have been using this lock for a few months without changing the combination. Suddenly I could no longer open it as it appears that the lock has changed its combination by itself.I called engineering in the hotel I was staying in to help me. It took them less than a minute to cut the cable with ordinary pliers.,1,0,313
A2F3CWV4C0AG7T,6979,I hope they never stop making this product.  I use my VCR every single day.  I clean it often and with the help of this product I can keep this system for many years.,5,0,166
A2F3CWV4C0AG7T,44,I was ready to discard my old VCR when I saw this product on Amazon.  It worked like magic the first time I used it.  This cleaner is a must have for all VCR owners.,5,0,165
A2F43W1M0UXJUP,22,I know how many opposing reviews there are and I know this is just another one to take in but. what I speak about the DVDA120U is the truth.  The PANASONIC DVDA120U is a very respectable DVD player for the money it is  worth.  It has a lot of the features more high priced DVD players have .ex.  Virtual Suround Sound. CDVCD capability. SVideoComponent Video. DTS  outputs. and Angle Selections. and it has no problem playing DVDs with  superior visual effects. such as the u0026quotMatrixu0026quot and u0026quotThe  Rocku0026quot. Unfortunately. I dont know how well the player plays DVD  movies longer than 2.5 hours .I have just purchased u0026quotSalems Lotu0026quot  which is 3 hours long so. I will soon find out. but I will say that if you  are planning to purchase your first DVD player. I would HIGHLY recomend  this one!P.S.  If you are also shopping for a TV with your DVDplayer  I would Highly Recomend NOT to get an RCA or a GE Brand due to faulty  soldering in both brands tuners which causes picture distortion and visual  noise.,4,1,1044
A2F6NUVSCOAOAC,3337,A little of the expensive side.I have three of these in my office mounted to the wall.They work great. look good and are practical. High Joulerating is appreciated!,5,0,164
A2F6TDBDM985NH,0,Ive had my Rio 500 for about 6 months now. and Ive had absolutely no problems with the player. Battery life is about the same as my old Rio 300. but its shorter if you use headphones with inline volume control. Ive upgraded it with a 64meg smartmedia card. and at 32ksec bitrate I can have over 130 songs available. At 32k the sound quality is satisfactory and Id rather have a large variety than CDquality. The Rio 300 allowed a 24k bitrate but the lowest on the Rio 500 is 32k. The backlight. bookmarks and random play modes are also great features. I dont use the equalizer very often. I also listen to audiobooks from an online site. where I got my Rio 500. The sound quality is usually okay. but due to a slow modem I have to download the lowest available quality. The higher quality files are huge but would probably sound much better. The bookmarking feature on the Rio is great for audiobooks as it allows you to easily resume listening after an interruption. I do have two complaints about the Rio. One is the plastic carrying case which makes it difficult to use the side controls for bookmarking. volume. etc. But it is move convenient to just slide the clasp over my jeans pocket instead of putting it inside a pocket. Secondly. the RioPort software is very clunky when compared to MusicMatch Jukebox or WinAmp. But there are several replacements available at another online site. I usually use Riorio or Riositude. You can search for either name and find the software.,5,1,1481
A2F76O89WU7FNI,22,I purchased this product last weekend and love it so much. Im buying a second copy later this week!  I teach college and my summer project is to put all my lectures on Powerpoint.  I hate learning new software and dont have the time for a drawn out learning curve.  It took me minutes to set this up. and another hour or so to discover that this actually does almost everything I need .a phone call this afternoon to the tech help desk which kept me on hold for less than five minutesa resonable wait in my opinionexplained that I couldnt do what I asked about.  But I can do everything I need as far as audio goes. I can record decent video via VCR. and the television image I can monitor with software on my puter screen is actually clearer than on my television monitor .albeit much smaller..  So Im happy enough to try another copy .for work..  I suppose in another year or so something better will come out. but for the casual videoeditor who doesnt want to pour over tech specs. this is great!,5,1,999
A2F7UGILQLGH8J,33,I put the 6002pro in my VW .im from germany.. and it works Great! only the Remote is bad..too u0026quotplasticu0026quot...don`t let it fall down..it will be broken!! but the alarmsystem works without any problems.But the install is only for poeple.who know something about car electric.,4,1,286
A2F8LBR2XNTIR6,22,I got this equiment today. It doesnt work. If. like me. you have a DSL connection and want to create a home wireless network. look into other options. such as 3Coms Airconnect .Dell sells them installed from the  factory..Before doing anything I read the information Diamond provided  in the combo pack meant to connect a desktop and a laptop. Since this  material didnt say anything about DSL. I called Diamond tech support.  First thing they said was. u0026quotDont use the packages CDROM. instead  get drivers from Diamonds web site.u0026quot Evidently the CD will mess up a  DSL system.OK. I got the drivers. I installed the card in my desktop.  and the drivers. and put the pcmcia card in my laptop. and installed  drivers. No wireless connection.After three calls to Diamond. and an  hour and a half on the phone. I got nowhere. Everything was supposedly set  correctly. the machines seemed to sense each others presence. but no  communication ensued.The tech people. who keep a file on callers so that  they know roughly where you left off after your last call. were stumped.One pointed out that you cannot use the Diamond set up if you have a 2.4  Gigahertz cordless phone in the house. I do. but unplugged and turned it  off for the trials of wireless installation. so this was not an immediate  issue. But it would have become one if we had gotten the wireless  connection working.Anyhow. Ill send the equipment back. Pity. because I  had hopes it might be an easy solution to get internet access from my  laptop when on the porch.,1,0,1541
A2F8XZQMWSDFU4,99,The charger works. but it takes a solid 6 hours to completely charge the batteries. I use this in conjunction with the nuflare flashlight. Im not getting anywhere near 15 hours of battery life. One if Im lucky. Maybe two. Its nice for the price but if you use them in something that as a lot of draw .like the nuflare rebel 90.. you should think about spending a little more one something that has more than 900mah. I would be surprised if these were 900mah even. they dont last very long at all. The nuflare is rated at 15 hours at 210 lumens or something like that. I wish I knew what batteries they used.,3,0,607
A2F9ZAWHK3E9W2,810,Ive wanted a Nook since the first generation ones came out.  However. I could never bring myself to spend the money on an ereader with no other features.  Once tablet PCs came out. I thought about purchasing one of those because they all have the option of downloading the Nook app.  However. most of the tablets out there are super expensive.The Nook Color is a good hybrid ereadertablet.  At the price of USD250 at the Bu0026N store it really is hard to resist.The Nook Color is a little heavier than some of the other ereaders out there. but not extremely so.  And it is a far cry lighter than my laptop.  It is very userfriendly.  I was registered and connected to WiFi in a snap.  The app store is not as extensive as the app market on my Droid phone. but Im okay with the selection.  Being able to listen to my Pandora account on my ereader makes me smile just thinking about it.  I was also happy to see that they had Ms. PacMan available for download.I am able to get onto the web and log onto my online classes from my Nook. That is a major plus. Now I can take my Nook to work and do my homework on my lunch break.All in all. I would say that the USD250 investment is worthwhile.,5,1,1189

A2FD03H5CQG76E,25,The RCA Superadio is a very sensitive. great sounding AMFM radio.  It pulls in stations from out of town and out of state. which will expand your listening choices.  .And is just darn interesting to boot..It is a big. heavy unit  more than 6 pounds with batteries.  Not exactly a iPod. but is fine for carting around the house to listen to while you clean up the garage.This isnt a DXing .long distance radio aficionado.radio.  For that. you would want digital readout and more control over reception characteristics.  This is a radio for those those who love the medium. listen a lot. and want a set that doesnt sound cheap and tinny.This can also make a very good home emergency radio.  Keep it on batteries .Ive easily run it more than 100 hours on a set. using it a couple of hours a day. use it for everyday listening while you get ready for work in the morning or make dinner in the evening.  When the power goes out or the alien spaceships land. turn to it to find out whats going on.There are radios that are a skootch above the Superadio in reception and sound  the C Crane CC Radio2 and Sangean PRD5 among them. But the Sangean is at least twice as expensive. the CC Radio four times so.  For less than USD50 you can have a highquality radio that will serve you for many years.  Every household should have one.Get it while you can  it seems RCA is not making it any more. or have cut back on production  a lot of retailers that stock it are no longer carrying it.,5,1,1474
A2FD03H5CQG76E,1516,The Grundig G2000A is like the preTV series Anna Nicole Smith.  hot looks. feels great. but not something you want to have around day in and day out.To be sure. its one of the nicestlooking radios youll find. but as a shortwave receiver. it lacks a lot.  doesnt tune the whole SW spectrum .why these radios just dont cover the full 1.7 30 MHz range is beyond me. sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired. and selectivity .ability to separate closelyspaced stations. is in adequate.  Plus. the audio is on the tinny side.  For the USD80 or so bucks you will normally pay for this. you can do much better.  Probably Grundigs worst model.,2,0,633

A2FHEVDFRIKTEB,12,In searching to purchase this video. I read the reviews on amazon.com of Tom Sawyer on DVD and I was confused. The reviews went from 5star to 1star. But I havent seen the movie in about 30 years and wanted to see it again so I went ahead and ordered it. I have to say I am so glad I did. From the moment I put it on I was transformed back to Radio City Music Hall where I saw it for the first time. I even remembered a lot of the songs. they just came back to me. and back in the day we didnt get to see the movies over and over again where we could memorize the songs. I didnt encounter some of the visual problems that other reviewers had. It may be a little dark in a few scenes. but I could overlook that for a trip down memory lane. Definitely worth it if you were a fan in the 70s.Tom Sawyer,4,1,797
A2FHLVW936UP22,33,This is an okay handheld radio.  I really thought it would have a better range on it but if you take it on trips and are mobile in a car you will need an antenna.  Other than that its a good little radio.,3,0,204

A2FP5Y913QBDTU,0,I like the idea of auto winding earbuds with volume control. The sound  quality is quite nice for what I listen to u0026amp over all I was pleased  with the performance initially. However....they do not seem to be made to  last. I would expect a product with a lifetime warranty to be built to  last. The first thing to go was the left earbudspeaker housing. The  insulation pulled out exposing the wires. Next the rubber rings on the  earpieces became so loose they would come off in my ears or push off the  outer edge when being inserted thus leaving a somewhat rough edge in  contact with my ear. Next the point in the wire where it separates to go to  each earpiece separated exposing the bare wires. Next the right earbud wire  pulled out just as the left had. I can understand that pulling on the wires  will cause the problems described above but it is unavoidable due to the  setup of the earbuds. You are forced to pull on the earbuds themselves at  first to remove them from the case. I will say that throughout all this the  sound quality u0026amp volume controls have continued to work fine.,2,0,1104
A2FQ516QQIYL54,33,I recently purchased a Nino 319 for Windows CE software development.  The price was very attractive and the offer included a clipon modem .which did not work..  Much to my surprise. the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit and SDK  for VB6 DOES NOT SUPPORT Windows CE 2.0. only 2.11.  Let this be fair  warning. if you intend on developing software for a CE device. buy one that  runs 2.11. stay away from these closeout 2.0 devices.,2,0,425
A2FQEAU5X4COQ7,811,The product is very practical and works pretty well. The USB charger is very useful. even you have a PC nearby. It comes with a small bag so it can be easily carried and protected.

Unreal and Ultima IX.the Glide was a better performer. however I recomend attaching a  fan to the Voodoo as it does run hot. and has dropped out on me until I  did.,4,1,301
A2FRO4XY02IHEP,22,I ordered this CB for my single seat rock buggy and was tickled with the fast shipping 2 days liked that it was all in one unlike the Cobra handheld jobbie that is 2 parts subject to moisture ruining it. So I got this unit in and box was not mangled or anything it was  packaged well. Plugged into cigarette adapter after hooking up to my k44 antanae and right off bat couldnt see the channel LCD display numbers they was unclear like a broken digital clock. So I thought well let me see how it operates and I will just get another exchanged. I hit up channel 19 on call display because I couldnt tell what channel it was on and keyed up my friend down the street on his cb and thats when I knew it was not going to work for me the speaker output is poor it sounds like someone is very far away in a bucket. just with buggy idling .It has quiet exhaust.you could not hear weather channel talking. So I would nt reccomend this to anyone with a offroad buggy maybe it would be ok in handheld mode but not on the trail where it is important to hear where your group is.,2,0,1066
A2FRXJD9IDR6S6,22,The description of this item was confusing. Cannot use it in my camera. Wanted to return it but have no idea what required RMA is.,1,0,130
A2FT4NPBE189NB,0,As expected. power kit was exactly what was needed.  Nice to have an extra power kit for work and home.,5,0,103
A2FTLYHRE1DLUI,0,We were looking for a unit to send and receive approx a half mile. This unit appeared to have promise. In Actual use It was diappointing as recieved. The Antenna sent was ineffective. We quickly switched to the Automobile Conversion Kit included in the box and spent an additional USD50.00 per unit to secure an external magnetic base 36 inch antenna  At that point the range increased to a usable distance.The rechargable battery modules were a disappointment and never performed as expected. So use with disposable batteries or use the Car adapter kit.included..If you need a toy for the children. the unit as sold should fill that bill.  Otherwise expect to spend  additional cash to get a usable unit.,2,0,705
A2FU30UN5N6T5A,3,If you dont want to run a new phone jack to accomodate a PTV recorder such as Tivo or ReplayTV. this jack works just fine.  While it may only be connecting at 33.6 or so. it has been rock solid reliable since Ive gotten  it. and saved the expense of installing a new jack.  I wouldnt use this  instead of a real jack for a 56K modem. but for applications where speed  isnt critical .like Tivo.. this works great.,4,1,412
A2FUTK3R13TQ8Y,2222,Decided to get into Minidiscs and bought this one because honestly. it looked pretty spiffy.  Amazon shipped it out and I got it pretty quick and immediately began to play and record with it.  Definately easy to use with  excellent features that just make this player worth it.  The price is  resonable for a minidisc playerrecorder and this one is definately worth  the price.,5,1,377
A2FV8QVFUP29DC,34,My husband had an old pioneer laserdisc player that finally gave up the ghost. I bought him this for his birthday and he is thrilled! The unit is very bulky and is noisy as well but plays beautifully! It handles both laserdisc and dvds. If you still have lds. this is the only available new player I can find. All in all a very good product.,4,1,341
A2FVXWX4G1HDR7,44,You need to remember that this is a standard grade product. I am someone who for years used a higher grade VHS tape to tape over and over and over again the television programs that we liked to watch. Well. those programs are fewer now. and the importance of having a tape that will withstand eight. ten or more tapeovers is less important to me. Also. because I am a very elderly person. I hesitate to expect ANYTHING to last for more than a few months. So. for me these tapes are  OKAY. ,3,0,489
A2FW35WBITKEG2,0,This mini microphone actually does work. but you have to be standing close to it for it to pick up voices clearly. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to use it as a memo taker...but to record conversations. if you are talking with someone who is a low talker or is farther away then 4 feet...I wouldnt recommend it.,4,1,328
A2FWCXNJ820P7Q,0,I had this cable longer than I used it. I only actually got about a month of use out of it when inexplicably my screen would black out and either come back on in a few seconds or a few minutes. I play games and when my display randomly decides to cut out. you can imagine the frustration I felt. I was at first afraid that my graphics card was going out. but when I plugged the same monitor into my DVI output. it was fine. Needless to say. this cable cheap but it is trash.,1,0,474
A2FWZFYPYQW9N7,0,I like the iomega zip drive for storing things and saving spaceon my hard drive. But i dont have a power cord anymore. Where can i purchase a cord from.,4,1,152

A2FY4IRPNJCRUK,0,I love my Label Maker.  I have a home office as well as a shop filled with supplies for our events.  There is something tacky about sharpies and duct tape.  I have 4 different color labels .this one being the green. and so our 4 different setups each get a color.  Then on each label I can put my company info incase it is lost of misplaced.The label material it self is a heat transfer label.  Meaning if it gets hot it will become black.  The green is more of a mint green. which is not an issue unless you are trying to make it match something. Overall. the resulting label is very resilient to fading in the sun. being pealed off of most surfaces .some plastics like Rubbermaid they do not stick to. and the size is very readable in both large and small fonts which my Brother pTouch prints.Now the down sides. which can be big for some people.  I am 27. and for a guy I have nails. which I need to get the backing off.  There is no split down the center like a crack and peal. so you have to try at the corner for a bit.  Once  you do a few you get a method down but it is still a pain if you need to label a ton of things.  .My label maker has an auto cutter so if i have to make 20 of the same label i turn it off. print all 20 on one strip. peal the backing off of the whole thing then cut off the labels one by one with scissors.  The second issue is chemicals.  I have tried to use them in the garage. but brake cleaner. degreaser and some oils will rub the ink right off.  It is weird because it is a heat ink so it must be a layer on top of the label which i am wiping off. but either way I had a flashlight and I tried to clean the oil off of it one day and the label became blank.  The sticker it self was awesome and stayed in place with no problem.Over all a great little label product. 90% of the applications it works perfectly. and the adhesive becomes quite strong over time so they dont fall off in 2 weeks.  If you are labeling automotive stuff or Rubbermaid bins you will need another product.,5,1,2016
A2FYUZXMFTZZC9,33,I am not a professional in photography but with my first digital camera Kodak DC 240 I have taken many excellent photographs. Its a very good camera within this price range. I did a good research before deciding for specific model and I am satisfied with my purchase. First big event of coverage was my own marriage. Now i got my marriage pics on a CD and my personal website and all pics are excellent. Before buying I was thinking that I had to buy many sets of batteries but in fact with only two sets of rechargeable batteries one can use this camera without any problem.,5,1,575
A2FZS014BE49RN,22,I still have many DD .720kb. floppy disks that I need to extract files from them. but this floppy drive will not read them. Was able to use this drive on a Mac to read HD .1.44mb. disks. but it failed to read any disks on my Windows 7 machine. Very disappointed. Will get a TEAC USB floppy instead.,2,0,298
A2G0O4Y8QE10AE,0,Despite all of the negative reviews. I decided to take a chance and buy the nook. once I tested it out at my local Bu0026N. I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility .epub format. book lending. etc..My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then. Ive experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice. but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. Ive also read three books in the space of a week. which is a personal record for me. as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback. longer if Im reading an ebook on an LCD screen.The eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day .and do. without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better. you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts. Amasis. Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. Im happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.My only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment. Im forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. Bu0026N has already sent out an update. which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy .Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page... I can turn pages in one second compared to the 23 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasnt a big deal until I received the upgrade.I also like what theyve done with the bookmarks feature. Before. they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade. it lists the page that you bookmarked. which is much nicer.I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the Bu0026N site to do everything. Once you finish the sample. you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book. you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that youve read directly from your nook with the press of a button. which helps manage your list.Sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However. you cant categorize your documents you can only sort them by title or author.Another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries .see ..... for a list of libraries near you.. sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores. and download free ebooks from either the Bu0026N site or Google Books. Thats what ultimately sold me on the nook. the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary. unlike the Kindle and the soontobereleased iPad.The interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device. or on the Bu0026N website. If youre still stuck on an issue. I found this great forum ....... with friendly people who can help you.Ive yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.Other than my issue with organization. I am really enjoying my nook. Im looking forward to reading many books in the future. thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.Side note. I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac. I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video. LCD works fine. But for longterm reading. eInk is the way to go.,4,1,3897
A2G0O4Y8QE10AE,1942,This is my introduction to the digital camera.  So far. Im very pleased with the results.  The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats. Fine. Sepia. Bu0026ampW. Negative Art. and Solarize.  It is easy to use. even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasnt using it however. for the price. I wouldve liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap. which isnt uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability. but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I dont fault the camera. but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and redeyes.  Photoenhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because Ive tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesnt have the same software that you do. then you will have to send that blurry or redeyed picture of Junior.  Oh. well. I like this camera. but if I win the lottery someday. I will go out and buy a CD camera because of the memory constraints that these floppybased cameras have.,4,1,1239
A2G0O4Y8QE10AE,710,I bought the Mac compatible version of this product and was sorely disappointed on many levels.  Although the instructions are explicit and easy to follow. the procedure didnt work.  I had to install the software first and then hook up the cable.  The software was a breeze to install. and my laser printer did work.  But it cut the print quality from 600dpi down to 300dpi.  It also slowed down the printing process. hanging up after printing a mere two pages.The next day. I booted my system and turned on my printer.  I worked on a document and tried to print it out.  It didnt work.  I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions. and it still didnt work.  Eventually. I wound up setting aside my laser printer and buying a cheap inkjet with a USB port.  Im hoping somebody will produce a better adapter in the near future. but Im not holding my breath.,1,0,855

A2G25TYPQLWSVB,22,This overpriced cord does not fit anything! I read a review that stated this power cord is too big and plugs are loose when connected. My cords were way too small. Nothing would connect to the plug end because the opening was too small. Does not say much for quality. Not sure how other Belkin products are but will steer clear from now on.,1,0,340
A2G2DM1PW9MM1O,0,Great product. But what IDIOT is gonna buy it on here when its almost USD50 more than what Bu0026N charges. and about the same for the 3G+Wifi version?,5,0,151
A2G2QNKDL1Y6AC,55,I bought this for a Kodak DC280. and it was OK to use.  I guess that I realized Ithat I wanted a larger style bag. though this one worked if I just wanted to bring along the camera and an extra memory card.  I was never thrilled with it. and then I purchased a new camera .canon G1. that did not fit in this case.  That was when I realized how good life could be with a larger bag.If you want a small case to just carry your camera and a few very small accessories .4 AA batteris and a memory card or two.. then this might be the one for you.  But it wasnt the right one for me.,3,0,578
A2G2QNKDL1Y6AC,7878,If you want a point and shoot camera that you can carry in your bag or throw in a shirt pocket so that its always available. then this may be the best camera for you.  While its not deep on features. it has the ones that are most important for convenience. a decent flash. 3x zoom .better for wide angle shots than telephoto closeups.. and APS film.Make no mistake. you do not get the flexibility .shutter speed. apeture. optional lenses. external flashes. white balance. that SLRs and more expensive camera can offer. but what you do get is not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes .thats not politically correct. is it?..I looked at a pretty broad set of cameras. including the other ELPH cameras. before selecting this one because I liked the zoon range and the size of the camera.  I was pleasantly impressed by surprisingly good picture quality. and my wife can testify to its extreme ease of use.  This ELPH is all about size. convenience. and simplicity.  If thats what you want then buy it.,5,1,999

A2G3KD3TIN53N2,0,Ive used other LCD articulating mounts that seemed better designed.  This is very stiff. making it extremely difficult to move.  The tilt can only be adjusted by loosening a lock nut on the back u0026 then retightening while holding the TV at the proper angle .not a one person job..  On other designs. the mounting plate secures to the TV u0026 then the plate fits onto the arm with .being held in place by gravity with only a small screw for safety..  On this one. you need to hold the TV up while someone screws the mounting plate onto the TV.,1,0,546
A2G4GS9EVCN3D2,814,Product arrived as promised and seems to work fine. Great price on this product as the big box stores charge much more for a product that really does not perform any better.  Good Value for the money.,4,1,200
A2G5CGQ08QPUVH,0,buyers should note that if you go through cricket music your muve music will stop working .other than that I am using it as a ready boost .and back up for my sons computer .I like my muve music way to much to ever give it up.,3,0,225
A2G5EJ3ZMTE9I9,0,I bought one from Amazon in June 2002.  I have used it for a few days. enough to become generally familiar with it.I am very disappointed with the City Navigator software.  I unlocked my home region .the midAtlantic region including Washington. D.C.. and loaded several maps into the data card with the included USB cable.  The street maps seem accurate. but the features are not. as if the data were very old or merely grossly incomplete.Examples. There are at least 25 Starbucks coffee shops within ten miles of my home and office.  The City Navigator software lists only one.  It lists no Dunkin Donuts restaurants.  None.  It did not list a hardware store I wanted to route to.  The hardware store has been in the same place with the same name for more than 50 years.  When I asked the software to find McDonalds. however. I learned that there are 505 of them in the map regions I loaded.  Great for the arteries.Around here. I dont care much about the missing data.  I know where the coffee and donuts are.  But when Im on the road. Id like to be able to find a Starbucks.  City Navigator wont do it for me.I tried to call Garmin but was on hold for more than 45 minutes before giving up.  Maybe the Metro Guide software is better than City Navigator.  I cannot tell from the Garmin sites poor descriptions.  Bad phone service bad website.  That equals lousy customer service.On the plus side. Garmin includes the cables and a data card .if a small one. with the unit.  I had no trouble unlocking my region in City Navigator and no trouble downloading and installing a software upgrade to the SPIII itself.  I am pleased with the tracking as I drive along. but the reception is spotty.  It will often lose coverage unless I hold it near the window.  Get the external antenna.  I plan to.I am waiting for my free City Navigator upgrade CD. which I hope will have some new data .like maybe a coffee shop or two..If Amazon allows. Ill update this review when I learn more.  .Not sure what the Amazon policy is on that..,3,0,2021
A2G5NE2IN7YAGJ,2931,I heard this speakers on my friends computer. and I could believe that they were under a USD100.  So. I upgraded from a pair of Altec Lansing ACS90s.  The yamahas sound 100 times better and the clarity is amazing.  This might be the best speakers under USD100.  I highly recommend these  speakers!,5,1,297

A2GB5FC460TM6C,12,After I read the rave reviews and ratings. I decided to buy this product. Besides the display .which is diffucult to read.. I also discovered that for some of my music. the sound was actually not up to scratch .the singing  part was faded. while on other players it sounded just fine .  I was very  disappointed  and decided to return it.,3,0,338
A2GB7PQ6OF23ST,44,This will help your tv very much.  It improved my television channels and I even recieved new channels I hadnt recieved before. You musnt put it near a computer though or it will make the channels really fuzzy.,4,1,210
A2GBY6JKI7TFBX,1012,The Barnes and Noble customer service for the Nook is the worst customer service I have ever experienced to a tech product. The hold time can be 45 minutes or more and are prone to disconnects.  The problem is not assigned a case number so that when it is not solved and you need to call back you must start again with the new customer service person. The tech was unable to email me a temporary password and tried to blame this on my Mac email account even tough I could send and receive email from others. Basically they could not unlock my Nook so I can not buy books online.  The customer service reps are not fully trained in the vocabulary used on the NOOK screens and the pop up boxes on the Nook that indicate problems block the information needed by the techs to try and solve the problem.Technical support could not solve a simple password issue. I certainly wont keep this Nook out  of fear of a more sizable problem in the future. Im shopping for a  Kindle now.,1,0,973
A2GC0SOHDE4L2M,1218,I used lot of cameras including Canon Rebel 2000 SLR camera....but i never got the results like Minolta supreme zoom...the best things the results are real good even in night and under bulb light....,5,0,199
A2GDEF2IY8Y99L,4651,As Plug and Play items go...it isnt one.  My Aptiva 200MMX computer couldnt figure out what I was installing and thought that it was a CD Rom drive.  After updating my BIOS and buying an IDE controller card. I thought  that I would be in business.  Unfortunately. that was hardly the case.  My  computer now thought that the unit was a 3.5u0026quot floppy drive.  Calling  DRTechs help line was an exercise in futility .u0026quotplease leave your  name. models. and problem and well get back to you in 24 hoursu0026quot..  Their website was not to be found... at least the website their  u0026quothelpu0026quot line instructs you to go to.  So now Im buying an  external SuperDisk Drive by Imation.  I hope that you do likewise.,1,0,728
A2GEC96F86XNCC,811,The package was exactly as described and the product was well built. I was not able to mount it to the wall. I did not know that it would not fit the TV I purchased. Shipping and product were excellent I just didnt get to use it.,3,0,229
A2GFF34UP8WJ3N,1,No longer available anywhere that I can find.  These headphones have three features not found together on any other headphones at any price.  .a. singleentry cord why is this not done on every headphone set?  .b. nice loooong cord! no skimping here.  .c. reasonably flatsided earpieces. with swivel even. so you can wear them comfortably when your heads on a pillow  like in bed.Sound quality is better than adequate .faint praise.. and its true that durability isnt their long suit.  But what do you expect for nine dollars?  And why does no other manufacturer make headphones with the three features I need?,4,1,609
A2GFWRG5LF6LGI,0,Two batteries didnt work properly! Not to mention. it has shorted out my flashlight! The batteries get very hot as well!,1,0,120
A2GFY5UYD0J2EW,0,Ive seen some negative reviews from people who purchased the Nook earlier this year .JanFeb.. however. I just bought mine about a week ago and have had 0 problems with it.  My wife received hers as a Christmas gift and has never had a problem with it.  I upgraded immediately to firmware 1.3 .the newest version. which adds some games .yay for Sudoku!. as well as a web browser.  If you are looking for a mobile web device. stick to a smart phone or netbook as this is not it.  Thats not a complaint as I never expected this to be a web browser for me. its first and foremost an ebook reader. and its a great one at that!The eink screen is amazing. and makes reading so much easier than an LCD screen .if you have to read a lot of PDFs for work I would buy one of these just for that!..  The other features on this are outstanding as well.  It reads a number of formats including epub and PDF. so you are not stuck only shopping for books from one source .i.e. the Kindle. iPad. and Sony ereader..  It is also compatible with Adobe Digital Editions. so its a snap to download a book from my local library and read it on my Nook.  Its also easy to lend books to other Nook users .so long as the book you have is LendMe.TM. compatible..  The media player works well. but only plays MP3s. so none of the songs you bought off of iTunes that is an M4P .i.e. DRMd beyond use. will work  thats why I always recommend buying digital music from Amazons MP3 store  great selection and prices. and NO DRM.  The sound quality from the speakers on the Nook is not so good .theyre small and I didnt expect them to be top quality.. but if you plug in some headphones it sounds great!I also like that it comes with three free books already preloaded .Dracula. Little Women. and Pride u0026 Prejudice. and you can customize your backgroundscreen saver with BMP. JPG. etc. pictures.  The only downside is that the battery life is not quite up to par with some of the other ebook readers out there.  A lot of that is due to the LCD touchscreen. but its worth the hit to the battery life.  That being said. I have had no complaints with the battery life for my daytoday usage and if you are a heavy user. you can buy a backupsecondary battery to swap out .try that with your iPad!..  As the title says. I love my Nook. and it seems like Barnes u0026 Noble has gotten the bugs fixed.  You can also take your Nook into Barnes u0026 Noble and theyll go over all of the features and show you how to get the most out of it  not to mention you can read any ebook they have for free while in the store. and they are currently in a 5 week promotion where they are giving away 1 ebook each week to anyone who brings their Nook into the store.,5,1,2713

A2GIFDGJDVSNFS,0,Ive been using this microphone for over a year now.  It works fine.  And considering its really the only option available for the Motorolla talkabout radios. Ill continue using it.  The only thing I really dislike about it is that the cord is way too short.  When Ive got the radio clipped to my belt. I have to stretch the cord in order for it to reach all the way to my lapel.  Not very convenient.,3,0,400
A2GIS1BQMZRQ4Q,11,Received the Nook for my birthday. I love it! I never considered buying an ereader. but I have tried both the Kindle and the Nook before. I find the Kindle to be so functional and inelegant its user interface is not intuitive at all. The Nook is so simple to use and the store is huge. I love it! Best ereader out there.,5,1,320
A2GIWHL6M8QXY9,33,A good stereo. but you get what you pay for. Cheap stereos wont give you highend sound. The CDs load at an awkward angle. and also take a long time to load. Overall. its not that bad. but not the best system to buy if youre looking for quality.,3,0,244
A2GK3W9ZB5MX42,34,These speakers and subwoofer make any song sound great.  They provide clear crisp highs and great bass.  If your looking for a 3 piece speaker set...this the one you should get.  I am very satisfied with them!,5,1,209

A2GKIHMWGSB00G,0,Nice clear sound with the Dolby NR.  Good unit for the price. but Im dissapointed that such a nice unit doesnt have a headphone jack!  Also if you are trying to track start and stop points on your tape by the counter you are out of luck.  When you go back and try to find that position on the tape a different number is displayed each time.,4,1,340
A2GKJU6L0BKJRR,22,I did not think a 3D sound card could make such a difference when playing games.  Unreal tournament and Quake 3 has never felt so intense.  This card gives depth to the sounds.

A2GKX4PN6H7RQ0,0,One of the batteries in the purchase was too big a diameter and is stuck in the flashlight.  Other batteries slide in and out of the flashlight.  Not sure why the battery in this group appeared to be too big.,2,0,208
A2GL17VGLLLFRU,0,I purchased 2 of these radios. primarily for field communications while playing paintball.  We used 3 Talkabout 250s. each with a Motorola earbud winline microphone and utilized the VOX capability.  They worked great and it was an invaluable communications tool during the games.  Communications were clear and the VOX worked well as long as the microphone was close to your mouth.  The earbud fit very well within the ear and was comfortable. The only drawback with VOX was the delay with the microphone activation when first beginning to speak. but this is to be expected with a VOX setup.  It didnt take us long to get in the habit of saying a word or two to activate the mike prior to transmitting what we really wanted to say. We have used these radios in the PTT mode as well and transmission is very clear and the range is good.  This is a great way to stay in touch with your teammates. or family and friends in other situations and environments.  Note. Amazon.com offered the Motorola 250 at a price significantly lower than I could find anywhere else. online or elsewhere.,5,1,1082
A2GM0SVPZE01IM,22,Buy a cheap universal remote.  I have no Zenith TV. but taught the VH920 that inputs 1 through 6 were the Zenith TV channel buttons 1 through 6.  It is not likely that the power buttons from your six devices will all be properly learned by the VH920.But the Users Guide should point out it doesnt matter!  If I have a power failure it will take me less than 60 seconds to reprogram the VH920.  I dont care that a device power button doesnt select the corresponding input.  It is only six to remember and the cheap universal remote has lots more use than as a dedicated remote for the VH920.  I now get CONSISTENT infraredinput selection from anywhere in the house as I also have home video distribution with infrared repeaters.  Video output seemsequal to input and with only one output could be passive switching .but I dont think it is..  I might actually prefer passive because too many active stages .AV receiver. Video processor. etc.. can cause abberations.  In direct comparison to bypass. audio is slightly veiled and compressed but most people would not notice unless comparing.  The input indicators are verydim and other reviews criticisms are true. but with one easy button push by remote who really needs to see the display.,4,1,1237
A2GMS1H8A13ZDP,67,I could hardly hear any bass from the player. I tried to change the earbud to a Sonys high fidelity earphone but the result was the same. The trible part was too extreme and might eventually spoil ones ears!  I was really  disappointed with it so I sent it back and exchanged for a Eiger Lab F20.  Now! this product  really does amazed me with the excellent sound quality.  Believe me. its much more better than the Diamonds junk!,1,0,430
A2GMXSTURI8JSU,1,The photo shows a keyboard that looks ergonomic .i.e.. designed to avoid repetitive movement injury.. However. an important feature is missing. Unlike the Microsoft Natural keyboard. this one does not have an arch built  into the top so that the hands slightly face each other. Instead the top  surface of the keyboard is flat. This lack of ergonomic design defeats the  purpose of buying this kind of keyboard. I have found that a touchpad like  the one on this keyboard is very helpful because it avoids the need to  reach out and strain your wrist for mouse usage. and its a shame  Microsofts keyboard does not offer this. The price is good. and the  keyboard seems to have quality construction. Because I was expecting  complete ergonomic features. Amazon was gracious in taking it back.,2,0,791
A2GN781YTT3G0P,5353,I bought this. and after plugging it to my PC it saw the device and installed the drivers just fine. My Win 7 system recognizes the device and seems to know when a disk is in it. Every time I try to access the disk it asks me to format it first. Ok. this is a brand new batch of disks that I bought at the same time. so I am fine with formatting. However. I finally get the error that windows is unable to format the disk. I checked the Sabrent support site and found no docs that help. I even tried a format from CMD and on disks that I know had been formatted before were recognized as RAW. which is totally wrong.Based on what I see from other reviews. this same problem is common. Some people are getting lucky. I guess. but I recommend avoiding this one for anyone looking to purchase a USB floppy drive. Seeing that my business relies on these things. this problem will cost me more than the price of the hardware.,1,0,920

A2GNZCUBL9LBEB,0,Ive had 2 of these. The 1st one got the UTOC error after 2 months.  Up until then. it was pretty good.  Great sound. but sometimes if I walked with it in my jacket pocket. it would skip eventually.  After the UTOC error. I got it replaced and within ONE MONTH. I got the same error!  I  cant recommend this unit and I think its been discontinued.,2,0,346
A2GOA36FXVH4Y7,710,The nook is a piece of garbage! It freezes constantly and customer service is horrendous!!! I have literally spent hours on the phone with them. without satisfactory results.

A2GOWDUXFP5P18,58,Its simple and works well for me. Sellers say you have to purchase an additional app. but mine works fine with the included Memo app on my iPod Touch 2G. Down side is that you have unplug it to listen to the recording.,4,1,218

A2GTNEGJR47CD,0,My wife purchased a Sony camcorder model DCRTRV103 in the summer of 2000 and gave it to me as a gift for to take on our 25 day tour of Europe in September .2000. After familiarizing myself it I never had a reason to use it until on our trip. About half way into the trip the unit failed in Rome . Italy with about two weeks left on our tour. After returning home I sent it to a Sony Service Center near St. Louis and received it back about a month later. I did not use it again until the following August for about 15 min. to record a Christening at our church and it Worked o.k. I didnt use it again until Christmas day to record our last holiday in our present home .All our family was present. After nearly an hour I checked to see if the cassette  had finished and I was shocked to see it had failed with the same exact failure as the first .I believe it should have held up longer than two hours of recording time since the repair but not so. Now Sony refuses to make the repair good ...,1,0,992
A2GTNEGJR47CD,615,I have no idea how good this product is and will never know as no Sony product will ever cross our threshhold ever again since Sony refuses to stand behind the TRV 103 u0026quotlemonu0026quot camcorder that I own It failed once in warranty and same exact failure again out of warranty with less than two hours usage.,1,0,316

A2GXVRB0B5LZG6,0,I have owned this subwoofer for about nine years. and it only recently had some trouble.  I realize its kinda pointless to review equipment that is nearly a decade old. but there is a fair amount of negative press for this item that I thought I might balance.I bought it in 2000 at a clearance outlet. and I dont remember what I paid. USD200 to USD250. I think.  It has been through a lot of music for most of those years.  I have even taken it places several times and used it with fullsize PA systems for bass reinforcement.  Its not a roomshaker for huge areas. but it added in the bottom octave decently well for what it is.  It never blew out or made funny noises in that time.I set it up in a friends home theatre system. and while there it stopped working and made some buzzing noises.  I took it home. and now it works fine.  It may have been a problem with their system.Summary. Loud. dependable bass in my experience.  A bit boomy and muddy thoughits a loud home theatre sub. not a precise hifi subwoofer.  Plenty of people have experienced failures according to what Ive read. but if you see one that still works at this point and appears to be in good shape. it might be a safer bet than it seems from its reviews.  Possibly.,4,1,1237
A2GYLGQJK5EJN3,0,The Rio 500 is good in what it has to do. Download your MP3 fast though USB. store them in 64 Mbyte onboard memory. and play then back. For the first time I can enjoy .skip free. music on my daily lap running. My first  choice would be however the Nomad II. It offers all this. plus a FM radio  and the possibilities to upload mp3 files back to your computer. Handy if  you have high speed internet access on your job but not at home. However  ... I live in Holland and the Nomad will not be available here before the  end of the year so I bought the Rio. Oh almost forgot ... the inear  haedphones that came with the Rio sucks! Sound quality is bad and the fell  apart. I had to buy nice quality Sony headphones. But the Rio 500 player  itself. great !,4,1,753
A2H0U8LGLEXHXV,45,They arent wideangle as advertised. They dont fold together enough to get a single vision through both lenses. so one always sees double. I had several friends try them and they all said the same thing. so it isnt just me. With a name brand like Bushnell I thought I couldnt go wrong. but apparently their quality control is nonexistent. I ordered these while traveling out west and couldnt send them back until I got home. I tried to return them. but Amazon said the last return date was one day before. so I am stuck with these useless binoculars. I need to find someone whose eyes are really far apart and give them to them.,1,0,627
A2H128JUWLI7P2,11,A wonderful cute radio for work especially for all of us who have to fit a lot in a tiny cubicle.  The CD player worked great and the cassette player was more than adequate for the price.  Although I had no problems on the AM  spectrum. the upper end 102.1+ end of the FM spectrum. did appear to have  some reception difficulties.,4,1,330
A2H1C7VP0BWVSE,1515,I do not really know what to say about this item except that it is a cable.  Yep it is!!! .o.However. when I bought my printer. I didnt know the USB cable didnt come with it .Mister salesperson at Sears didnt feel obligated to tell me I guess!!.. so I had to find one.  After looking around I found out that Belkin was the most famous and reliable brand for computer cables. and others...  Brand doesnt make a big difference for me usually. but as far as electronics are concerned I want to be able to get the best. so I went for Belkin... The Belkin website didnt really offer the best price .I wouldnt have thought so!!..  However. Amazon did!!Ive had the cable for about 2 months... I actually forgot about it because I never had any problems with it. The connection between the printer and my computer was done right away. without ANY problems.I would definitely go for Belkin again if I needed to.,5,1,902
A2H1C7VP0BWVSE,5461,Ive had the PowerPlay Plus for3 years now.  I bought the set from ..... if I remember correctly.  Initially for my laptop which had the lousiest sound quality.  Listening to MP3 was almost painful with the laptops speakers.Well. its 3 years later. Ive replaced the laptop. but the speakers are still there.I listen to MP3online radio and play games every single day. and these little babies have never let me down.  I am very satisfied with the sound. bass. and everything else.Im pretty sure this set will get hooked up to my next computer .,4,1,542

A2H1I0AR67NWAC,0,No surprises here  functional and works well for my needs. storage compartments seem to be nonabrasive on the CDs.  My one suggestion would be for the CD pages to be removable. so that one can rearrangereorganize  ones collection more easily.  As it stands. the plastic 3 ring binder post  does not open to allow pages to be removed and shuffled around.,3,0,353

A2H1S4BHHZB5S9,33,If youre considering buying a digital camera for the first time. consider the following three items as necessary. 1. optical zoom 2. builtin flash .as in light. not memory. 3. highest possible resolutionThis camera has two of the three. Technology is moving so rapidly that Olympus has  introduced two newer models .D2000 and D2400. that are higher resolution.  I guess that this will just be like my PC  I replace the camera every  three years.It is easy to handle and the software that comes with it is  good.  Memory cards are inexpensive to purchase.  Theres an interesting  accessory. a 1.45X lens attachment. that gives better optical zoom  characteristics.I recently had my Olympus D610 smooshed by a horse  trailer and replaced it with the D620.  Theres no real differences.The  only negative. other reviewers are correct about there being NO WAY to  force the flash to go off at night.  Recently I had to turn on the patio  light just to get enough light for the flash to work.,4,1,986
A2H3RKOQANZ78N,5051,This is my 4th radar detector in 15 years.  Ive had Uniden and Whistler units before. but this one performs the best.  In fact I had originally performed was the ESD6200 and decided to upgrade to the ESD6700.  The 6700  does an excellent job at filtering out false signals in both city and  highway modes.  The only minus is that the voice is not as loud and  distinctive as it is on the 6200 model. Otherwise the USD40 extra is well  worth it...,5,1,446

A2H5E7FIUP3M17,0,I see many complaints on here about the position of the note book and kindle and how it is not ideal for right handed people.  However. I have just received a Moleskine Cover for Kindle 2 and it has a switchable option  you can turn the note book around to accommodate both righties and lefties.  It seems that maybe they took the complaints into consideration and changed the design a bit  in a good way!Overall its a beautiful way to coverprotect your Kindle. and its a quality product.,4,1,488
A2H6B29CUHZNG5,44,This is  a nice. solid cable. Arrived on time. good condition. good solid gray color and works properly. No complaints here.,4,1,124
A2H6D0718S7C3Y,0,Bought one of these at WalMart.  I had a 15 day return period.  13 days into it with only one book read. the bottom half of the screen went black and unresponsive.  So I took it back. bought anohter one of the same.  Two days into it. it started acting glitchy.  I love the style and concept of the Nook as well as the size and feel. but seriously. they need to fix it so you can read more than one book on it before it goes out!,1,0,429

A2H80FSONHLJXI,0,I wanted a retractable car charger that would charge while in use.

A2H8Z5NLXL8HIJ,0,I have had my Rio PMP300 since April 99. and I must say I adore it.Ripping your CDs is easy. and they sound beautiful in playback.  Its incredible to be able to select ONLY the tracks I want to hear every  morning.  I am never without mine.  Its small size and low weight make  carrying it everywhere I go painless. And no skipping!  No fast forwarding  through tracks I dont want!  Plus. it only uses one doubleA battery that  lasts for weeks! What a dream!One note... if youre thinking of buying  one. shell out the extra money for one with more memory.  The 32 meg model  stores at MOST 10 songs. usually more around 7 or 8 .without flash memory..  Thats fine for a day. but can get old fast. especially on long trips.Unlike one other reviewer. I have had no trouble with my unit  whatsoever. It has been nothing but solid.A great gift for your  favourite geek.  Or if youre buying for yourself. go for it!  You wont  regret it!,4,1,931
A2H98ISCL38HA2,46,I bought this cb less than a year ago. In that time the LCD screen has LCDs missing so I cant tell what channel Im on. It also doesnt get any reception at all after trying 3 different style antennas. I have used this maybe 5 times while offroading and I would not waste my money on this thing. Not happy at all! Money wasted!!,1,0,326
A2HAI0067KA0C3,15,If youre looking for a good allaround radio to take on camping trips or just have around for latenight boredom. this is it.  A little heavybulky. but the sound that huge speaker puts out makes up for that.  If youre a talkradio buff or just an amateur BCBDXr youll be real happy with this.  Tuning sensitivity is not great but is very good. and the range on the AM band is AWESOME. The FM sound is also very good! I havent tried hooking up an external antenna to it yet .yup. its got a jack for one.. but you can bring in stations from a long ways away with just the internal antenna.  A dial light would be nice...that would be a big improvement.  All around. for the price. its a helluva good radio,4,1,700
A2HAYE0TESEAKF,1,I replaced my hard drive in my Zune with this model. This replacement hard drive seems to use quite a bit more power than the old hard drive. Other than that. there are no issues at all  James,4,1,192
A2HB6SS59F5I2B,0,Thanks so much!  This cover performs exactly like I wanted.  Love the handheld option with elastic band. as well as the two standing options.  Love the purple!  Really dont find a need for the stylus holder. but it doesnt get in the way.,5,1,237
A2HBLXU6UHLSR3,22,Bought this camera December 31.99 My son got one for Christmas. and I used my christmas money to buy myself one. Looked at the 83. but couldnt resist the 10x zoom for 200.00 less.Very happy with all of the many features.  Highly recommed.,5,1,238
A2HC6DS4I7S0ES,25,I got these speakers as a gift. then found them here on Amazon.  They are amazingly good for the price.  Mine even came with an AC adapter so I could save on the batteries!  However. it doesnt charge your ipod. thus only 4 stars.,4,1,229
A2HCMKTJDND6PO,23,The Nook Tablet itself might be a fine product. My brief encounter with the actual tablet exceeded my initial expectations. However. I was told the great point of difference about the Nook versus other tablets was the customer service. Unfortunately. after having my Nook less than 24 hours. I learned of several issues. I reached out to customer service. I started with chat. After being fed automated responses that didnt answer my questions. the chat session abruptly ended after 1 hour for no reason at all. I then sent my questions via email. I was again met with automated responses. Sixteen days later and they still havent answered any of my questions. I then called. I was told to seek out my answer via the web because they were experiencing too many calls. I opted to wait. Guess how long the wait was? About 30 seconds. This deemed promising. However. the person who took the call didnt seem to know much about the product. I finally conceded and asked to return the product. I followed their very detailed guidelines on returning a product. However. the product .which was sent via certified mail and signed for at the appropriate destination which they do not dispute. seems to have been lost in space. I have yet to receive a refund. And. after multiple phone calls. chat. tweets. emails. etc. I imagine my only recourse at this point will be to file something with the Better Business Bureau. For those who live within 5minutes of a Barnes and Noble. perhaps the Nook is the way to go. Overall. the tablet worked great if you recognize the memory it touts is really limited to Barnes and Noble stuff and the amount of proprietary gunk they have on the tablet limits you from using it as a true tablet. Basically. it is a hyped up version of an ereader for those who only want to shop Barnes and Noble. This is ok. as long as you know thats what you are getting. But. for anyone who wants customer service and cant make it to a store regularly. dont count on any support. Dont count on anyone being helpful. Dont count on anyone doing anything other than sending you automated responses that may or may not address your issue. This is really too bad. But it is honest. I rarely complain about a product. But. when a company is this incompetent one must be honest. And. when a company touts that the number one point of difference is customer service and the service is this horrific. well I think that speaks for itself.,1,0,2435
A2HD4OPK2JWK1F,3850,In its most basic form. a trackball is functionally superior to a mouse  obviously. less energy is expended moving ones thumb rather than the entire arm. and Logitechs latest creation is by far the best trackball in  existence.  With its optically guided pointer. the sensitivity of the  interface is spoton.  I have made many hardcore mouse users *see the  light* with this very device.Switching from a mouse to a trackball may.  at first. seem awkward. since you probably learned to use a GUI using a  mouse. but isnt it time to graduate to a higher level of HumanComputer  Interface?ps  sorry lefties.

A2HDC502NCIXOW,1515,One of the reasons I purchased the ETX90 is its portability.

I took the ETX with me back home .Kuwait. and I checked the hard carrying case as a carryin. Even though the case is designed to stand great pressure. you should always check it as a carry in.

I use mine whenever Im outside.running. yardwork whatever. Youll need to replace the earbuds  but if you buy a used one do you really want to use someone elses earbuds? The serial number will rub off so write it down as another reviewer suggested.Also. if you buy a used one. make sure you get the USB cable. Its proprietary and you cant get it anywhere. .Refer to rio support coments below..Customer support at rio .or sonic blue or whatever they call themselves this week. is a joke.

A2HM5WYF0ZT86O,44,This is a superb radio for Jeepers. or alternatively anyone who plans a road trip and wants a CB without a having to perform a great deal of integration work.  It works very well. and the ability to convert it from a docked configuration to a mobile. batteryoperated radio is fantastic. as it allows you to go dismounted and still communicate with other vehicles.  Its also great to keep handy if youre convoying with vehicles that dont have radios  I keep one in my Jeep to give to other drivers on a road or camping trip.  Mine came with two battery packs. one of which has a recharging port for use with rechargable  AA  batteries. the other of which I pack with regular alkaline batteries as a backup.  Ive found the battery life to be tremendous and have gone all day without recharging or plugging it into the vehicle dock.Regarding range and power. remember that this is a CB. which is a lineofsight device designed to operate over a short range. and any walkietalkie CB will have reduced range when compared to a vehiclemounted system .you really dont want to run a highpower antenna right next to your head..  However. if you rig up the base in your vehicle you can run 4 watts through a decent antenna and get regular CB range.  The sound quality is very good if not a touch quiet in a loud vehicle. with automatic noisecancelling as well as manual squelch. and it picks up local NOAA Wx channels pretty clearly.  The screen backlight is helpful for night use.  All in all. if you want a versatile. portable CB with good output power. I would highlyrecommend this product,5,1,1581
A2HMH7WZ7U3M6T,45,Installation was easy.  TV is stable and can be positioned in many positions.  Not sure it would be all that stable if the TV was moved a lot. but the mount works perfect for my use.Have bought a couple more of same mount.,4,1,222
A2HMZNZFOZ4EL1,0,the sync cable is very low profile. the charger is separate so you can bring just the sync cable for short trips or the charger for longer trips  .the tranformer adjusts to different voltage and comes with adapters plugs  for use in other countries..i find this kit very useful... more so than  my cradle since this is more flexible in usage i wish they would also sell  the sync cable by itself. my biggest complaint .and yes. i agree it is more  expensive than it should be. is that the sync cable connector .the piece  that is inserted into the Palm. is exposed and does not come with a  sleeveprotector.,4,1,607
A2HMZNZFOZ4EL1,1212,ive owned several pilots and really enjoy the V for its high portability. while the stock 2meg is anemic. there are a couple of companies that will upgrade the memory to 8meg for around USD100 .but beware. doing so will void the Palm warranty. if you find that it is essential to upgrade later on...the screen  is easily the best ive ever seen on a pilot... exceptionally sharp. the  casing is aluminum and lends a solid feel to the V while trimming the  thickness to about half of the IIIx. its difficult to express how much of  a difference this reduction in size makes until youve had a chance to  carry them around but its definitely a positive factor for me.i didnt  have the deletion problems that plague the previous user although i did  have to reboot the pilot a few times although to be fair. i found it to  be the cause of some sharewares i had tried to upload.i find the palm OS  to be stable and v3.3 along with the hotsync manager v3.0.4 is truely a  blessing  among other things this combination allows IR protocol for  hotsyncing my data without the cradle to any laptop equiped with an IR  port.,4,1,1112

A2HO3GPTSIK2NO,3,i am very satisfied with this product. but do not fully understand it.  it was simple to operate.  i used it to transfer some old pics i had on floppy discs.  ninety percent of the time. i worked. but wouldnt download some discs because of formatting problems.  all of the pictures were taken at the same time and stored in the same way. so i dont understand why it didnt always work.  for the money. though. it was a good investment.  i got to save a lot of old pictures that i would otherwise have lost due to changing technology.,4,1,532

A2HRY9QJCXWJ0T,2122,I just bought these about a week ago and I am about to pack them up and return them and get my money back.  The sound quality is awful and the wireless reception isnt much better.  If you really like listening to music. then these are not for you!  You have to constantly adjust the reception to get even the most basic stereo reception.  If you like the primitive sound of AM radio from an old handheld radio. then these are for you.  If. on the other hand. you like to hear the subtleties of the music youre listening to in stereo without a bunch of static then save your money and buy something else.  These are horrible!,1,0,624

A2HT8SQNVFNBRN,6464,I searched. researched. priced. and compared all makes and models of weather emergency radios.  Result. Amazon offers an excellent deal and Midland offers an excellent product.  I have this Midland model 74200 for a home alert and I also purchased the Midland 74250 for mobile alert info.  Both have SAME technology that you program into the radio.  Note. Initially. the programming can be thought provoking but once this is accomplished. any weather emergency alert will advise you. at your command. of your specific areas in text and alert tones.  ANYTHING can happen at ANY TIME  These radios will let you know immediately.  The best manufacturer for this type of of product is Midland.  The best place to purchase this product is here. at Amazon.,5,1,750
A2HU71Q2EP9TB1,1920,Its a great machine. and Im glad I purchaced the IIIx. Ive seen the V and the VII. and the IIIx is the best. I do wish I had waited a little longer for the color version. but that doesnt really matter for me. because I use the MIDI software more than anything else. The memo pad is  cool too. I take notes in class and print them out with my desktop comp. I  also have a color cover. and that makes it look brighter. The backlit  screen is great!I also researched the Handspring Visor. but the  color display was hard on the batteries. and the memory says its  u0026quotupgradable.u0026quot but I havent seen any proof yet.So buy the IIIx  if you dont care about color. and if you need the extra 2 megs.,5,1,703
A2HUL3GGQWW8BA,3435,This is the fourth EZPass holder that Ive purchased in the last 5 years.  All of the previous one Ive tried have been made of hard black plastic.

A2HVC22OD9BEE1,33,I was thinking between Panasonic A120 and this. but decided to spend some more money. And no regret now. I love this one. It has zoom feature so that you can zoom pictures if your monitor is small .Especially good for if you  are watching wide screen DVD software.. Only bad thing is that FFREW  button is tricky. if you dont hold button for at least 23 seconds. it  skips the whole chapter. .pretty pain....

A2HWZMKL9DHURQ,14,This card will never replace the old ISA sound blaster cards since the OPL chip is absent. it uses wavetable synthesis for midi instead. that means that when playing a midi file youll hear u0026quotrealu0026quot instruments instead of that cheap and artificial midi sound from the old ISA soundcards in general. Thats a good point. but I think any PCI card can do wavetable. So whats the problem with this card? The problem is when you want to play old DOS games that are compatible with the old Sound Blaster 16. Voices will sound as good as in the old ISA card. but midi music is affected. badly affected. what youll hear in most cases is a real disaster made by instruments mismatch and misbalance. Just try playing PC games like Xcom UFO. Golden Axe. Kings Quest series and all you can download from the internet. If the OPL is not there. you may want to turn down the volume... Conclusion. If what you want is a nostalgic date with DOS games. then try to get the old ISA card. if not. get a PCI128 or an Ensoniq which is cheaper than this one. and its from Creative too.,3,0,1075
A2HXR372Y7XLC,1213,After attempting to use this head cleaning tape in my Panasonic VCR. the picture is worse than it has ever been!  This tape never did  play  correctly.

A2HZ9MJ1CW6GJM,0,Barnes u0026 Noble NOOK Tablet .NEWEST Version. Color. BNTV250.The Nook Tablet is about USD100 over priced.Web capabilities are very poor and slow web capabilities on most smart phones are better than on the Nook Tablet.  If you make a Google search it takes almost a minute before you can select and item from the search. The email APP is broken. If you delete an email it immediately reloads the deleted email.The book selection for the eReader is disappointing.  One would expect that if you can buy the book in a Barns and Nobel store you should be able to buy it for the Nook.  Many books. like the Harry Potter series. are not available for the Nook.

A2HZWB42WSR1PF,25,This inexpensive pointandshoot camera takes great pictures and is convenient to pack on trips. Its easy to load and runs on 2 AA batteries. The data option can be toggled on or off. The redeye reduction feature  isnt perfect. but the flash is adequate for work within 1015 feet. The  macro feature requires some practice to use effectively. Backlighting can  be a problem. but generally speaking this camera is a great value and worth  considering for good snapshots.,4,1,467
A2I00JI6QOPNR7,55,The USB Zip is fantastic for Macintosh as well as PC.

Dont load the Iomega drivers as they  conflict with the drivers akready a part of Mac OS.  Several forums  encourage you to simply use the drivers apple includes for carefree use of  the zip.  I love this unit.,4,1,461
A2I01UUKU71KO9,66,I ordered this rechargeable booklight specifically because I am tired of having to spend money on and ruin the environment with batteries. Based on a review I read. the Moleskine sounded like a great option. And. if it did actually work. it would be.However. the first booklight I got turned on by itself and stayed on because the onoff button didnt work. Had to stick it in a drawer until the battery ran down so the light wouldnt keep me awake. Obviously defective. No problem...these things happen in an imperfect world. I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement.The replacement worked fine for a few days .charged with no problem. onoff actually worked.. Then. for some unknown reason. the lights dimmed to the point where I couldnt see a word I was reading. I thought maybe the charge had run out .although I had just charged it.. Nope. even when plugged in. it stayed at that same dimness which made it unusable as it was impossible to read with that amount of low light .a candle puts out more light to give you an idea of how dim it was.. So. I contacted the seller again and asked for a refund because 2 defective booklights in a row didnt give me a reason to order 3. The seller promptly refunded my money and apologized. They did make a point of telling me that no one EVER had experienced what I did and they have NEVER had to exchange or refund one of these booklights. Im not sure that implying your customer is lying is a good business practice. but whatever. I am off to continue my search for a better. rechargeable booklight. Wish me luck!,1,0,1569
A2I03PXZGZX529,3032,Ive had this receiver for almost a year and its not bad.  5.1 in can only be used with a dolby digital decoder. so dont think any dvd player will connect to this.

A2I3CLTPRXM57K,0,I love this remote.  Its great. and not just for working out.  There is one problemIt reverses the headphones.  For example. if something is supposed to come out of the left one. when the remote is plugged in it  comes out of the right one.  You really dont notice it with regular music.  but definetly with things like Adam Sandler. and talking that uses  different sides for each person.  I still gave it 4 stars though. because I  thought it was a great idea.  Why I didnt give it 5 Both the headphone and  the remote cord seem too long.  I cant clip it to my pocket because I trip  over it...If you have a way around this. definety buy it.,4,1,643
A2I3EE6G2OTE5L,1618,I bought this DVD player last Christmas from a department store. I always liked RCA.  I had no problems with the DVD for a few months and I liked it. it had good features but missed zoom. and the menu screens were easy to get around and the glossry was a nice touch. But then it started making a high pitch noise that sometimes became louder than the movie I was plaing on my Dolby Digital theather system I used. Then the Disk Tray would not come out the whole way and would get stuck. It made noise from the beggining but this noise was crazy.  The manufcr. would not do anything for me. I would have to pay for the shipping to get it fixed and for labor. I did not get it fixed and am currently shopping for a new one with a better Rep. I dont recommend shopping for the lowest price. Because the most important thing is not features. but if it works and if the thing breaks. is the warranty going to help you if it is not just a 90 day or one year parts.  Look around.

A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,1819,I hadnt heard of this 1973 movie version of the classic Mark Twain story until recently. but I absolutely had to see it.  After all. it had music by the Sherman Brothers .best known for their work in Mary Poppins..  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer .Johnny Whitaker. is a young boy growing up in 1840s Hannibal. Missouri.  An orphan. hes being raised by his Aunt Polly .Celeste Holm..  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn .Jeff East..  He constantly lies to get out of trouble. too.Through this movie. we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher .a young Jodie Foster..  But will Injun Joe .Kunu Hank. get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book. hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly. that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story. I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately. I found the songs disappointing.  They werent bad. but they werent good either.  They arent especially memorable or singable. and they dont really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical. I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they arent a major part of the movie.  So if you are looking for a fun version of the classic tale. you can do much worse than this one.,4,1,1803
A2I7FVI4OYAI3K,11,Ive had my NookColor for about a year and I absolutely love itwouldnt trade it for anythingbut theres one hangup.  You can only use the charger thats specifically made for the NookColor.  The original Nook .black and white. charging cable wont work.  This wasnt a huge deal for me until I bought a portable charger.  Im travelling more now and wanted to be able to charge my cell phone. MP3 player. and. of course. my NookColor.  Alas. my new portable charger works for everything except my NookColor even though Im using the correct NookColor charging cable.  According to Bu0026N NookColor support. you cannot charge the NookColor via USBtocomputer connection even if youre using the correct cable.  In addition to the specific cable. you must also plug it into the wall.Now. dont get me wrong.  I still have no desire to replace my NookColor.  I never leave home without it for any reason.  I really wanted to give prospective buys a heads up regarding this deficiency.  I can live with the situation. but maybe there are others who this would be a severe restriction.  I still highly recommend the NookColor.,4,1,1112

A2IAD8XA81CQWQ,710,I bought a Nook today. The one and only reason I chose Nook .instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1. is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund. not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work. like my Kindle did .and still does. and all of my Apple products do. But. like so many other reviewers here. my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First. it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on Bu0026N and strong WiFi in my home. plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then. when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked. it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting helpsupport on the Bu0026N website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off. using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out .the fully charged. battery. etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So. am taking it back and wont buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle. and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindles inability to download library books.  Im giving the Nook two stars instead of one because. if it actually worked. it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update. 12811Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go. so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook. so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast. wifi connected easily with my signal. downloaded a book quickly. and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update. and theres probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So. I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update. 2311Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to. but there is one problem .design flaw?. that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color. lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either. seemed like too many steps and screen flashes. but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is. again. that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is. like an iPad. highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off. which it is most all of the time during reading. you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it. almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me. no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances. the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect .haha. that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle. but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem. it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 53111Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook. but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So. last week when Bu0026N had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website .99.00. free ship. 3gwifi. noncolor. refurb w full warranty. I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in JanFeb. I am using the Nook just for library books. and it does what its supposed to do. Navigation works well. but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook. the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub. then stick with Kindle.,3,0,4974

A2IBVJ2P4471I3,1,I received my Elph as a gift in 1999.  Shortly afterward I took it on vacation.  It was so easy to use I could switch film while riding a bike!  I got just about to the end of the third roll of film when the u0026quotdreaded Hu0026quot reared its ugly head.  Following the manuals advice. I took out the battery. replaced it. and... it rewoundexposed the whole roll.  Since it was under warranty. we took it to the camera shop to have it repaired.  The owner told us he got this problem with Elphs a lot. and if we had this problem again. wed be better off purchasing a new. different camera than paying to have it fixed.While it worked. I took the best photos of my life... crisp. clear. gorgeous!I used that camera without a problem until early this year when the u0026quotHu0026quot returned.  For a while I was able to reset it.  Then it started eating brandnew rolls of film.Part of me really wants to buy another one because it took such great pictures and was so fun to use.  But the practical side of me thinks its an awful lot of money to spend on a disposable camera.,3,0,1077

A2ICT9A9NFH6X8,0,After what I thought was a thorough research between the Kindle. nook u0026 Sony ereaders. I took the plunge u0026 bought the nook. What appealled to me most were the web browser u0026 ePub use to check out books from the library. However. after fully charging the nook. I took it with me for a weekend at the beach. I didnt bring the the charger because Bu0026N said battery would last up to 10 days with wireless off. Well. I found out the hard way. with wireless on. it barely a couple hours reading at night u0026 in the afternoon by the beach. Oy. was I frustrated with nothing left to read u0026 another night u0026 afternoon left. Lesson learned. must bring charger everywhere! Lost 1 * for this.Im not a fan of touch screens. still love my trusty pushbutton cellphone. So browsing the web was a pain for me. having to navigate around the screen with my finger. Page turning was fine. but I think Ive overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant pageturning friction .0... Scrolling down u0026 up also frustrates me  most of the time I have to swipe several times to get it to move. Not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads  the response time was slow which made me think it didnt sense my touch. so Id do it again u0026 it goes back all the way to the main menu. Grrr! What a pain as I have to restart the store search u0026 find the page again.Bu0026N samples are horrible! They give you 7 pages...but its the cover. copyright. dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest Bu0026N is 1 hour drive away so I couldnt take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading instore.After I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders. that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles. my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didnt want to lend it to him because he would see all my books u0026 potentially read them. This is a biggie for me so lost another *.Features Im happy with. I was able to checkout books from my library u0026 I was able to put my pdf books on the nook. Yey! Unfortunately. my library just got into ebooks u0026 have only a handfull of books so itll be a while until I can fully take advantage of this feature.Well. these are my personal experiences with which I now realize that I didnt do a thorough reasearch as I first thought. LOL. My fault...but I still like my nook. though Im no longer in love with it like when I first received it. Ive also ordered the latest Kindle so well see which one Ill keep  Im looking forward to the pushbutton keys on that. LOL.,3,0,2626
A2IEJQ8754BMSI,35,I barely touched my Tablet until I got screen protectors because I was terrified I would completely wreck the screen since. screens seem to be allergic to me. I bought this type .anti glare. for the same price as non anti glare. u0026 I went to Bu0026N where the nice NOOK staff put mine on for me. So far no scratches u0026 its doing great protecting my screen! My only complaint. why I rate this as 4 stars. is that I have to clean the screen even with the cover fairly frequently because its beyond easy to leave finger smudges all over it even with clean hands. I dont mind though. If im too lazy to clean the screen I just place my hand flat on it u0026 run my hand across evenly so that everything turns into one big smudge that I can see fine through .P. I definitely recommend this product.,4,1,798
A2IGB9QTU7LK4V,0,This Product is worthless.do not spend money on this. I put it into the machine and it ran for about 5 seconds.I tried it  a couple of times. I received the same results. How do I return this junk and get my money back?,1,0,219
A2II4B6CJ4O47Q,44,I like this camera so much that I bought two more after owning the original for several years....It has more features and menus that would take a lifetime to master. fortunatly I need to use but a dozen or so.....compact. sturdy metal front. nice weighted feel. choice of megapixel settings. great pictures. nice video and sound.two viewing methods. panorama photos. docking station available. etc... and best of all. the later two camera cost me under 80 bucks each from different interenet sources.....whereas the first was about 275.00......hightly recommended and without a day of problems for any......one went to my wife. one to a relative. and then my own.,5,1,663
A2II4B6CJ4O47Q,1720,This through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as I am only looking for local traffic tieup information of closeby autos....the problem is that it will not stay on the windshield....I am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeks....the first one was put on by professional installers of all my 3rd party electronics ... have dealt with them for years as they do excellent work...it fell off and was lost after about 10 days....the second one I put on myself...and followed the directions to an exact degree....including the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for 4 minutes....cleaning the windshield as directed etc etc....using silicon to seal the unit further...this one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lost....the third one was supplied to me directly by Midland at no charge. much to their credit....I havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weather...I have my fingers crossed....would I buy this again....definitely not.....probably no through the glass units from anyone else either...............,1,0,1111
A2II4B6CJ4O47Q,55,It is very large but does have pretty good sound and reception. I live in an area where some people cannot get half of what I get on this unit....buy again because of performance...yes.....buy again .... maybe not because of size being so large....,4,1,248
A2II6078YUIVZT,12,I needed a 50 ft. Ethernet cable to connect my network BluRay player .living room. to my PC .den.. I chose this one based on reviews and reasonable price and was not disappointed. Construction seems medium to heavy duty. not cheap and flimsy. Worked first time and I have not had any issues with connectivity since it has been installed in December 09.,5,1,352
A2IJNA3AKVWGL9,12,Having used the 5mx for nearly a year now. and the Psion 3a for several  years prior. the 5mx has become indispensable. All contacts and  scheduleagenda keep my life in order. but hey. any Palm platform can do  this. Where the Psion really excells is in its ability to become a near  desktop .or laptop. equivalent in your pocket. and therefore be with you  all the time. As a physician. I use it for all office notes. and with a  slick program called ChartNotes. can convert notes to letters. etc. While  this program will only appeal to a select audience. it points out the  versatility of the platform. with literally hundreds of programs and  applications available. most either free or for a modest sum. easily  obtainable on the web. directly downloadable. for whatever the users  interest or occupation is. The ability of the accompanying PsiWin to  seamlessly synchronize with MS Outlook. both for schedules. contacts. and  emails. as well as allow rapid direct printing or faxing. and rapid  transfer and conversion of Word. spreadsheet. and data base files makes the  5mx an extension of the desktop. Indeed. this redefines the concept of  u0026quotpersonal computeru0026quot. as for me. in order to be truly personal. it  needs to be where I am. always available. all the time. This is much more  than just an u0026quotorganizeru0026quot or PDA. I find myself doing at least 50%  of my u0026quotcomputing timeu0026quot at my Psion. The 56K travel modem also  allows me to retrieve emails. and fax off documents. The small .monochrome.  screen makes web browsing suboptimal. which is about all I end up using my  desk top PC for now. The EPOC platform never crashes. even when running  multiple files and programs simutaneously. I only wish Windows was as  robust!,5,1,1774
A2IJUA3CQUIQRX,6869,A simple item to have to watch videos and pictures on your HDTV.  Maybe a longer cord would have been better. but I have no complaints about quality.,5,0,149
A2IK5WQOTXW4DL,0,I cant say enough about this item and this seller First the item was so much fun I purchased it to carry in my purse and it was all I thought The seller was wonderful the instructions were perfect I received it fast and it was just perfect I certainly will be back thank you again,5,1,280
A2IKPO861L8O90,22,We wanted a full motion mount for our 50 inch tv and this one is perfect. Pivots every which way. Was a bit tricky at first aligning the holes but definitely worth it! The stores wanted over USD100 for the same item!! Would highly recommend!!!,5,1,243
A2IL3E3X9XM9O5,11,I bought this because it seemed to have some features absent on the kindle and the reviews were favorable.  I found it to be unstable and not user friendly.  The touch screen is slow. challenging to use. and nonresponsive.  The touch keyboard is so small that unless you have toothpick size fingers. it takes repeated attempts to type something correctly.  The text size would not change.  The instructions are not clear. 3 G would not connect.  The web site is far inferior to amazon.com. as is the book selection.  Kindle books on amazon are organized better and have better prices.  Should have known better.,1,0,611
A2ILHV40STAFZM,23,I thought I needed a custom cable because the HTC cable has what appears to be a fancy small end.NOPE.  Its just a regular usb mini connector.  Thanks for the reviewers above for sparking the idea to try a regular cable in my phone.,1,0,232
A2ILKUTFTX35B6,33,i was doing some research for some good headphoens to use to listen to music when im relaxing or studying and i was skeptical about this at first because no one had ever commented on it before. i first bought sony monitor headphones and they HURT! i just put them on and had to take them off right away and didnt even try it with music on... then i shopped around and figured that maxwell headphones shouldnt be that bad because my college doesnt sell a variety of headphones and only sell the ones that actually sell and maxwells were one of them. i went to staples to get some supplies and actually saw ONE maxwell headphones left and they were also only priced for a total of USD30 and so i decided to give it a try. when i took it out and tried it first before the music. it was really comfortable! when the music. it really has a nice sound and does drown out the noise around you EVEN WITH WITHOUT the batteries for the noise cancellation. i would recommend this pair of headphones to anybody who loves a bargain and also comfort and sound wo the hinderance of performance just for the price. it even is compact and includes a pouch for it! how convenient especially since it also includes plugs for the airplane...for anyone who needs to travel...,4,1,1254
A2ILM65T0A9TC1,1213,as a samsung yepp owner i desided to complete my mp3 park with the rio 500 for expanding memory and ability to recieve audible formats. rio promotes with the audiomanager 3 and firmware 2.12 the 64MB external use. a joke.  olympus 64MB and ONT 64MB are not formatable .the rio recognize the 64MB.  but after start formation. the rio hangs and can be only relocked by  removing the bat.. the rio tech support is insufficient. compareable with  the rio song quality. i resume. samsung has the only ultimate 5star  yeppsound and i have had better kept my fingers away from rio. now i am  hearing my audibles from my hp jornada. sitting on my rio to hide them.  schumacher. md samba@swissonline.ch,1,0,693
A2IOPL6BQON6UA,17,The images always seemed out of focus.  I read the manual word for word and nothing helped.  For every image I took there was a ghost image sitting beside it that had to be deleted to get it out of the way.  I tried different kind of disks to no avail.  I tried the disk in different computers with the same results.  I would not recommend this camera.,2,0,352
A2IQM2RTIOT888,79,I Got this camera one year ago. The film gets jammed almost every month. It broke On a big trip adn I had to buy disposables the whole time adn they are awful. I was very dissapointed. This camera is not at all worth  getting. Spend your money on something that will work. and last.,1,0,282
A2IQMBBNQQREPT,34,It works on my iMac 27 . but the directions didnt help.  It would seem intuitive to just shove it in the computers rectangular hole made for the lock.  It did. though. require a lot of fidgeting to get it inserted.  I had to hold the barrel from spinning and insert the lock at the same time...very frustrating.  But. it is on now.,4,1,331
A2IQTGLZ3PIWAM,0,I have 2 of these and neither one works in the 2 different VCRs I have.  They make the screen worse.  I then use my old style Maxell cleaning tape to fix the picture!  How can I get the old style Maxell VCR cleaner?,1,0,215
A2IQZ7BRU5NM4S,22,I have one of these in my car. and it works extremely well. With a MIC gain and RF gain that is adjustable. you can punch through loud and clear. The display is easy to read. and in outhern California I can pick up three  weather channels. The memory channels are an added feature. but be sure to  hook up all three wires or the channels will not be saved in memory. The  lock feature is a plus. to avoid unwanted setting changes. Just get the  best antenna you can to go with this great mobile radio and youre good to  go. A super value for a super radio!,5,1,556
A2IR8ER264O63U,5758,It did not take long to come. it came in about 3 days. It protects you Ipod touch really good and the texture of the case is smooth and comfortable to hold. At first when i got it was hard to open. but you would get used to it. only you have to be gentle just in case. The color is great just like the picture. Good price. BUY IT!,4,1,330
A2ISO0UO039GT2,0,I bought this for a Canon EOS film camera that requires 123A batteries. as opposed to the convenient rechargeable LiIon packs you see in modern DSLRs.  It hasnt let me down.  I usually recharge every few rolls. and Ive never even seen the battery indicator at less than full.,5,1,275
A2ISX4NLTUMNPD,12,As far as usb cables go. it did its job. and i know in a store I wouldve spent a lot more. Worth the purchase.,5,0,110
A2ITNH3KSPQWZF,0,I bought this item because the price was cheap. and yes. it worked cheaply. The plug is too loose. and the biggest problem is that it gets really hot less than a minute. It even makes burning smell and strange sounds. I just tossed it to the trash can because I was so afraid of fire. This is just waste of money. Id rather pay more for the decent item.,1,0,353

A2IUAT0NF7OVTC,1,This cable did what it was supposed to do. and was a great price.  I did recently upgrade all of my cables. including this one. but not for any reason in particular.,3,0,165
A2IUPVIDEENHN0,0,Its nice looking. end of story. I do not usually respond to reviews. but I felt compelled to do so. If you are looking for SW to the UK this totaly sucks. A total waste of money. I bought this direct from Amazon and will never trust them again in any form of electronics. They are good in books and the like. but not sw radios,1,0,326
A2IUXZQQKRD8ZY,1059,I like how small it is. and the capsule shape it comes in. However. the quality is horrible. It cannot pick up my voice at all. Its useless and a waste of money.,1,0,161
A2IV124H3FG64H,11,I bought this unit about three weeks ago and it seems to work great.  The only reason I gave it a four star is because I have not recorded on it yet. so I dont know how well it records. other then that Im very happy with  it.,4,1,225
A2IVVJIGKBE8AV,0,I bought this to use in my home office with the Cisco VOIP phone system at my company. not the Spreed conference service.  I plugged it in. changed my audio settings. and it just worked.  The first day some people mentioned there was a lot of background noise and echos. but playing around with the input volume levels and disabling the PCs builtin mic seems to have cleared it up.  Now I am able to walk around my office and even step out into the hall. and the volume in both directions is fine.The only strange thing is that the first time I use it after rebooting. if takes 510 seconds for the input level to adjust itself. so my first sentence is hard for others to hear.  I work around that by just talking to myself while the phone is still ringing so the level is set right when whomever I called answers.The on hook and off hook buttons dont work with the Cisco IP phone. so when someone calls me I have to answer in the phone app. but mute and volume buttons do. so its not really a big deal.,4,1,1002
A2IXK5LB4Y0NYV,0,These GPS units do NOT take SD cards. while it may be a perfectly good microSD card and adapter. its not for the product listed in the title of the item.,1,0,153
A2IXNEHMM685C9,0,I got this aas a gift for my mom she just purchased a new tv and wanted to hang it. It seems durable and she is happy with it. So I guess for the price I would recommend it to others.,3,0,183
A2IYECKOTKGOMA,1,I can not say it is not safe  as long as it does work. But a moment ago when I picked it from my laptop bag and wanted to lock my laptop with it. I sadly found out that the lockhole was misplaced .God knows what had happened to it. and I could not fit my key in. OK they said they would have a lifetime warranty but I hate such kind of trouble. I guess they could provide better product with such a price. Any way since it is a touch lock .I like the design very much. I could still give them 2 stars. but not more.,2,0,515
A2IZ0CCB5OJI95,615,I bought this mount due to the price should of known that when a swing mount is less then USD40 its not going to be the best. First its a pain to put together instructions not that clear. Second the arms which is shown on the picture are very flimsy. I would recommend this only if your not going to be moving it alot otherwise spend the extra dollars and get it from Costco or Walmart so you can return it for a better one.,2,0,424
A2IZRPCRB1AUR5,0,I have owned this radio for about 1 year and am happy with my purchase. It has very good AM reception and average FM reception. Im certain that better radios are available but not for the money. I paid USD45.00 for mine from Radio Shacks website.,4,1,246
A2IZZS4MHA8IWP,23,I purchased the black set of wall and car usb power adapters for my IPod Nano 2g and as far as I can tell they do not work. I plug them in. and then plug my IPod into them. and the charging symbol flashes for a few seconds. however about 4 seconds later the charging symbol goes away.Guess Ill have to end up purchasing the more expensive version anyways...,1,0,357

A2J11LO19PHVDC,0,this thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room. i tried to download the driver from a website but no such website exists. i could download it from the from pirate bay. but thats illegal and unsafe. so i have all these pictures of dear family members .some of them are dead.. and i cant retrieve them!,1,0,314
A2J23EEY400TCZ,0,the best parts. the touch screen. the battery life. the contours .easy to hold.. and the fact that it reads epubs and pdfs well.the parts that could be improved. highlighting the text with accuracy is pretty difficult. sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I am used to on other products,4,1,300
A2J3JRF1IP2ELM,0,OK this particular model is defective and there is a pending class action suit against Sony. It can rarely get through a DVD without having some sort of audio or video problem. I would not reccomend this player to anyone.,2,0,221

A2J46SDQ4H5GBM,0,The webcam can function with low light even less than 1 lux. it adjusts itself according to ambient light source. It is easy to install and it  comes with great software bundle. Considering its capabilities it is good  value for money and is worth the extra few bucks that you pay for and you  wont regret.,5,1,306
A2J4ND8XBXLRL3,55,Before I purchased a digital camera I reviewed many.My first choice was I beleive it was a HP 200 or something like that.The price was the same as the Olymbus D300R.I went and looked at the 300R read the reviews which  were all good.Now that I own one now for three days I cant say enough.This  camera is amazing.Very clear in or outdoors.Easy to hook up to a pc and  TV.The software is great.I am completely satisfied.One minor detail.I have  to get to learn how to preserve the battery life.You cant use the LCD to  much.But whats perfect?At this price I can put up with it. Anyone trying  to decide on a camera for this price.stop here this is the one.Pleased  in NY Long Island AnthonyT4u@cs.com,5,1,699
A2J4VHYFK340OC,2022,u0026quotMinidisks the wave of the futureu0026quot ...all that I have to say about this is ...HA.  All minidisks are. are glorified cds.  But this review is about the Diamond Rio pmp300 which I have recently purchased.  I find that the diamond rio 300 is one of the most excellent values out  there...not only with no moving parts there is no skip .as opposed to a  minidisk which has 40 second protection. but also. the price value is  excellent.  I say this because all those poor feebs now who have mini disk  players have to pay USDCASHUSD for their music.  Why do that when I could log  on to a popular Mp3 music servers and download free music.  The only gripe  I have with the Rio 300 is that it only comes with 32 megs of memory...and  flash cards are a tad expensive at the moment.  I have to say though...this  machine is perfect.,4,1,840
A2J5ZIUR1C1KKE,23,Very handy. And reusable. well. .....now I have to provide more words.... Handy. handy. handy! I just need to remember to use. especially on RENTAL DVDs.,4,1,153
A2J6CTZ3PD3J0U,0,Not the comfortable rubber ear buds. are old style hard walkman type headphones. If you want the rubber ear buds dont buy these. they are hard plastic.,3,0,151
A2J6S5AMZTFYP2,0,I bought this for a tac light. I was going through a pair of regular lithium batteries anywhere from a couple of weeks to months. but at USD11 dollars a pop i was getting fed up fast. So far these rechargeables have worked great. The only thing is the charger itself looks kind of cheap and flimsy. but for no more than what is supposed to do it has worked all right.,4,1,367
A2J77Z6F12U2M2,0,I purchased this camera in August of 98. and moved overseas.  In January 99. my eightyone year old father was riding on the back of an elephant in Thailand.  When I went to take a shot of this once in a lifetime event. the  camera lens froze in the out position and would not take a picture.  A  moment lost forever!  Attempts to get the camera fixed overseas were  futile. as they would not honor a US warranty.  I sent several emails to  Olympus asking some direction but received no response.Also. soon after  we purchased this model. my husband and I stood side by side taking the  same picture with this and a Samsung comparable model. both on automatic.  and found the resulting pictures to have no noticeable difference. Due to  the lack of email response by Olympus. I would hesitate to buy another. as  this one was money down the drain.,1,0,846
A2J79QR2PX35SB,1317,Unfortunately I had to return this.  It was missing a crystal at the top and the flash drive would not slide out properly.  I saw the bad reviews of this. but it was so cute that I decided to take a chance on ordering it for my granddaughter.  She loved it so much that I had her dad order another one.  When she took it out of the bag. it came apart in her hand!  Her dad superglued it back together.  The only reason that I bought a replacement was my 11 yearold granddaughter loved it so much!  She doesnt care about the flash drive. whether it works or not she just loves Mickey Mouse!,1,0,589
A2J7A70CVBDWID,0,I just got this mic today and am still trying to get my ipod touch 1st generation.  Ive updated the software on my ipod to 2nd generation.  Still cant get it working. But everyone else on here seems to have got it working.  If any suggestions would help out alot.,1,0,263
A2J7AUZK63LZJR,1,works great. popped open when plugging it in but it went right back together. pleased with it other than that.,4,0,110
A2J7H542DTI8ID,23,I bought this trackman because I was tired of having a sore wrist from working with a mouse. It is amazing how much better the Trackman is for moving a curser and for scrolling. I have an older computer. its funny to think of a pentium II computer as older. and still use Windows 95. This model was the only one I could find that is compatible. The newer Trackman modles all require Windows 98 or higher os. Also this model has a serial connector. which I can plug into my split keyboard. and has an adapter for the round PS2 connector. The Trackman allows more freedom to work. I can set the unit anywhere on my desk or even on my lap. The only draw back I have noticed is that this model is not as smooth as the newer models. It has all the same functions and uses the same software as my cordless Trackman. I recommend this model to anyone who is still using Windows 95 or who wants to connect to their serial port.,4,1,918
A2J7UWRODZ06S9,44,bought these into work so I could tie up all the cords at my desk. Hate when my feet get caught in a cord. these were perfect.,5,0,126
A2J85HHUMSF4Z7,0,I have had my charger and batteries for about 3 weeks now.They seemed to work great the first time I charged them. I charged both sets and used the one set the very next day and they only lasted about 30 constant minutes . Luckly I had the other set with me I popped them in and they as well only lasted almost the exact same time. I charged them that evening and after the first set came out of the charger I put them straight into the flash light which by the way is a surefire 130 lumen light. anyway I turn it on and left it on setting where it wouldnt burn anything. I started my stop watch and timed it out to 1 hr and 10 mins before it went dead. I have done this a couple times and they seem to be lasting longer and longer. Which is good because I use my light daily and when its on its usually for at least 45 min straight. Best money ive spent towards flash light batteries! Hope this helps people on there decision to buy because thats what I do before buying is read reviews.,3,0,988
A2JAGOIH2DZAN,34,Just got back from a week in London and Paris. I used this adapter to power my HP laptop and I used its builtin USB port to charge my Blackberry Bold. iPhone 3GS. and iPod Touch with no problems at all. The builtin lights are really handy. The power light lets you know its plugged into a working AC wall plug. I found that not all plugs in the Chicago and Houston airports are working. so having the light was really handy for finding a working outlet. The second. USB. light gets brighter or dimmer as power is pulled by the USB device. For example when my Blackberry was plugged in and recharging. the light glowed somewhat dimmly. but when I made a call. the light glowed more brightly. So you can tell when you have a good connection to your USB device.Overall. its well built and easy to operate. Ill be keeping this in my travel bag.,4,1,840
A2JBHLKEY50H8,1919,A little over a year after purchasing this unit. it simply stopped playing. giving only a u0026quotTOC errorAu0026quot message.  After sending the unit to a repair shop .the unit was barely out of warranty please be  warned Sharp provides only a 90 day labor warranty. and a one year parts  warranty.. I was told that the laser was defective.  Cost for repair. USD150.  Sharp refused to help me with this problem in any way.  My recommendations  are to not buy ANY Sharp products.,1,0,480
A2JCDQMF6B5S7D,49,I have just received this item and am very impressed.  The tripod is very sturdy and well built.  The number of adjustments for a travel tripod is impressive.  I am a little surprised at the size given that it is a Travel tripod and would have liked something a little more compact.,5,1,282
A2JCRGGHE5464B,22,For the price. this cant be beat!  The cables are slightly smaller than OEM. but still work.  I have an issue with the USB cables though.  The first week they both worked fine.  But after that neither of them would work.  They just flash on and off as charging then not charging.  These cables are also shorter than OEM.,4,1,320

A2JDDUN6YNRYKU,13,I purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance. The problem with wall mounting flat screen TVs is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the TV you buy. Im using this mount with a VIZIO E320ME 32inch and it works perfect.,5,1,301
A2JDEAJ5HXULEZ,33,I bought this cable which seemed to be represented as a Canon. althought I doubt it was .or is..  No matter. it arrived quickly. it looks well made. it works perfectly. and it cost about 17th the ridiculous price Canon was charging.  Highly recommended!  RLT,5,1,258

A2JFF23K5FUHE3,0,Much cheaper than buying in a local store. about one fourth the price. After actually using it. I realize that having a longer one would make some tasks I need it for much easier.,4,1,179
A2JFHS5XX1PMXZ,0,I own a pair of Bose acoustic headphones that costs USD300 bucks and sound like USD600.  These sound like USD20. a big difference  but they cost about USD5 so that is pretty acceptable.Better sound than most ear pieces. easier to wear over a long period of time.  Worth the money as a quick throw in the computer bag set to listen to the laptopmp3 without bothering the neighbor folk on a plane or train.  I like the folding mechanism. as they allow for tight packing.  A little tote bag would have been nice.  Worth the money. if you get them for under USD8.,3,0,559
A2JFOHC9W629IE,11,I got a really good deal on my III. and Im happy I bought it. However. the Palm V would fit my .and most peoples. style better due to its size. 2 meg is plenty of memory. unless your outlook contacts measure in the 5 figures and you must have 50 different applications.Graffitti is fine once you learn it. which isnt hard. But while the recognition is light years ahead of that Apple piece of junk that I was stupid enough to buy a few years ago .I had to have something.. you cant write things down on the fly and expect the system to convert to text. Although I dont have one. I believe there are digital ink applications there which allows one to scribble notes in whatever handwriting you have. As long as you can read it. thats fine.I have no idea whether Palm compares favorably to Windows CE. but if you judge by sales. Palm runs away with it. The battery life is not what I would like. but its adequate. But if you want a shirt pocket PDA. the Palm V is the only solution.,4,1,980
A2JHMP2RWNWIVI,1718,Its a great radio with lots of featuresTV band. timer. weather bandwith knobs in convenient places.  I got good reception. not the case with some previous radios in my location.I find the timer and weather useful features in the bathroom.  The display is not backlit though. so that takes away from its usefulness as a clock.,3,0,325

A2JII0BVKHVWPQ,45,I have used the Kindle HD and this Nook HD beat it by a mile!ProsBest picture quality. Has more pixels per inch.No ads!Charger is included at no additional cost.Lighter.Great warranty!

A2JKB314U8LDQ1,0,I bought two of these several weeks ago and they work GREAT. I opened te box and not five minutes later they were up and running. The sound is INCREDIBLY clear. with almost no static. and the value is unmatched. They  are also smaller than they appear. easily fitting into the palm of ones  hand. A great buy!,5,1,309
A2JKNJRR04BK2B,6466,I know this is not a popular item to purchase. I was glad to have found it on Amazon.,4,0,85
A2JLV8S5H41IJD,22,received it timely. but so far a couple of them would not save the files I was trying to save.,4,0,94
A2JMN2JA9LSHVL,0,Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.  I made mine work for my 32  set and it serves its purpose. Just wish the seller was upfront on the condition. I could have bought a used one for USD5 less.,1,0,320
A2JNCU6FVVB6ZW,12,Ive used TNT2 Ultras and geFORCE256 video cards. both are fast. .the geFORCE is a lot faster in 3dWinbench. but Voodoo is the way to go for gaming!  FPS in Unreal Tournament running 10x7 with 16Bit color are about  the same for all three cards.  Everyone talks about 32Bit color with the  nVidia cards. but come on. how many games on the market now use 32Bit  color.  Not many. so your paying extra USDUSD for something you cant use.  The  big difference is textures. the Voodoo cards .Even two Voodoo 2s in SLI.  blow all other cards away when running Glide!  Take a look at your game  boxes. chances are all of them support Glide. this means that the Voodoo  cards are the way to go.  I would buy a 3rd party fan to attach to the  Voodoos heatsink. they get VERY HOT. and the colder you can run your card  .and system. the better performance you get!  If you want the best. go with  a Voodoo 3 2k for now and wait until March when the Voodoo 4 and Voodoo 5s  are scheduled to be released and go for the Voodoo 5 6000 with 4 processors  .4 way SLI. and 128MB of RAM!  The 6000 should be the baddest card around  if the PC Mags are right. but start saving your money now it will put a  dent in your wallet if the pricing in the Game mags are right.  Ive been  a big fan of the Voodoo cards ever since I bought my first Voodoo2 card.  3dfx continues a great product with the Voodoo 3 line.  There is a good  reason why your only options in most games are software. Direct3d and  GLIDE! Anyway. hope this helps.,4,1,1509
A2JNIVIFZNKF61,3540,Label tape works as advertised on Brother PT90.  Just take the cover off of the back and insert cartridge.  It works wonderfully but I think that its pretty sad that I paid more for the tape than I did for the whole labeler.  Regardless. Im still very happy with the product.,4,1,275
A2JPRDRQ5X5VJS,0,It takes a little getting used to. but the change is so much easier on your wrist.Im thinking of going to the optical. however. as the rollers in this mouse do wear down over time.Either way. this product is comfortable and recommended.,4,1,236

A2JTOF068V4I64,2,These are good headphones. They deliever good all around good sound. However. theyve got a few flaws. For one thing. while they are light. they are a bit uncomfortable at times. The remote control thing on the cable is at a bit heavy. so it can pull at the cable. which can be annoying. I bought these so Id have headphones until I could afford a nicer model. If youre doing the same thing. I would recommend these. But. if youre looking for a good. keep em for live headphones. dont pick these.,4,1,495
A2JW04KQLD397G,33,Bought tons of these in the 80s. and 90s. now they are like gold. Used to get 3 for the price of one of these. but Im sure theyve stopped producing them now. so they will be precious if you can find them. Cant beat the quality of theMaxells. if only I had stashed a few packs of these things years ago!,5,1,302

A2JX7RNVFSR4BN,5363,Its a great tablet but very underpowered because of the stock Bu0026N android environment. I recommend rooting it and using a different Android ROM. When you do this. a very powerful tablet for half the price of competitors.,5,1,224
A2JX884LQWIQLX,22,Nowhere in the product description does it say that this device will only work over the same phase of power lines. If the same phase is not available in both locations that you wish to connect. forget it.,2,0,204
A2JXM2JO6UXGRL,11,The batteries that come in the pack are great!  The charger leaves more to be desired.  This charger must be unplugged each time it is used in order to reset an internal timer.  I guess that is one way to work it. but maybe a small reset switch would have been a better design idea.If you buy these batteries and the larger charger. it is a much better combination.,3,0,365
A2JXM2JO6UXGRL,1819,I bought this charger and a lot of the ACCU batteries for work.  We are using them in flashlights and NightVision goggles.  This charger is great.  It charges the batteries in a quick mode. then trickle charges.For us. thats great!  Weve got a small bin for new batteries. and one for used.  When the charger is free. we put four more batteries on and walk away...  It is really nice to not worry about when to take them off.  And we have plenty. so we dont have to worry about the length of the charging cycle.This charger also will accomodate AA. AAA. C. D. and 9V.  Thats great!!!  We can put our MiniMagLite batteries on the same charger as the DCell MagLite batteries!  This is a really good buy. and Ive saved a lot of money for our company using the ACCU system.,5,1,769
A2JY0MTZBFR660,23,Like most people. the minidisc was a distant memory in my mind. stored  away with the likes of Crystal Pepsi and the McDLT. However. while looking  for a way to move my MP3s to a portable device. I stumbled across the Sharp  722. Reluctantly. I purchased it. and in a word. its incredible.Im not  an audiophile by any sense of the imagination. But to my ears. the 722  makes incredibly high quality copies of any music source. I found it easy  to attach the recorder to my computer and move MP3 files to MD. Granted.  this isnt as fast as a Rio. or Nomad... 74 minutes of MP3s take 74 minutes  to move to MD. However. the time difference is more than made up in the  ability to switch mixes instantly.Although prices are falling. flash  memory is still prohibitively expensive for most people. However. with  three dollars worth of MDs. you can record more than two hours of digital  quality music. plus some.  Thats the more than double the maximum capacity  of most similarly priced portable MP3  units. And recording couldnt be  easier. All you do it turn on the external source. sit back and relax. The  722 does most of the work. including dividing tracks. Then. you are free to  name and edit tracks. which is made much easier thanks to the jog ring on  top of the unit. Essentially. the MD is like a superhigh quality cassette  tape for the 21st century. It gives you all the convenience and audio  quality of CDs. with the customizable of tape.With all the included  features taken into consideration.  Id say the Sharp 722 is the biggest  value in portable audio out there today. Compare it with many of Sonys  units. and youll find its more feature packed. more user friendly. more  durable. and much more economical. I would highly recommend this unit for  anyone looking for a high quality music solution.,5,1,1817
A2JY1V4354076T,55,I admit I am a bit of a gadget lover. but that aside.  I thoroughly enjoy my DVD50 Player. and use it all of the time.ONE. The screen. Although the screen is small. it is bright enough to view comfortably in just about  any indoor setting. and the swivel is such that it is easy to adjust to  just about any viewing angle. The pixel quality is equal that of many  highend laptop computers. and it offers an acceptable viewing size for an  average 2 hour film.TWO. The controls. The miniremote control is  functionally complete. but a bit difficult to use in poor light. Perhaps  backlighting or glowinthedark buttons would have been a good addition.  However. the size of the remote is perfect as I can slip it in my travel  bag with the player. and it takes up minimum room. It is not much larger  then a credit card. While in hotels. I use it quite a bit and feel that the  size and functionality is exceptional.THREE. Is a laptop better? Often.  a comparison is made between this unit and a laptop computer with DVD.  However. if you already have a laptop which has substandard DVD support  and you do not wish to go out and get a new one. this unit is your best  choice. If you have USD3000 to burn. then perhaps a high end laptop with DVD  support is the way to go. but then you have a large laptop to deal with  instead of the nicely compact DVD50.FOUR. A secondary DVD player. One  of the greatest uses I have found for this marvel is to simply grab it. run  over to a friends or relatives house. and plug it in! It is always a hit  to hook it up to anothers TV and offer DVD to the  u0026quotunenlightenedu0026quot. Also. I can move the unit around the house and  connect it easily and quickly to TVs that dont have DVD drives hooked up  to them.FIVE. Sound. This is probably the weakest area of the unit. but  you really cant blame the unit too much because the sound problem is  really due to the small size of the unit. Essentially there is no BASS. The  speakers tend to sound like just the tweeters from a home audio system so  the sound is very high and u0026quottineyu0026quot sounding. With headphones  though. the sound is quite acceptable.SUMMARY. I enjoy this unit and use  it almost daily. It is the smallest unit I found and offers the greatest  bangforthebuck. especially since the recent price drop.,4,1,2322
A2JYIKOM56C7W5,9394,For the money. this mic does an excellent job.  I just wanted a mic to email my friends some sound and it preformed well.  You sometimes have to work with the volume to dissolve some background noise. but overall it does  a wonderful job.,4,1,238

A2JZRPGZVQ2KD0,0,After less than a month in my Samsung S4. this card is fried.  Lost everything on the card.  Not a huge deal since it was all backed up on my computer.  Was out of the country at the time.  Now Im back home and discover that I cant return the item because the option to return expired a couple of weeks ago.  Luckily it wasnt an expensive item.,1,0,344
A2K0VNVAH1UXG4,11,The head set didnt work for the radio I had.  I should have been more careful.  It was a good price. but not if it doesnt work with what I had!If someone buys this. they need to make sure and check their model against the list on the head set of models it works on.,2,0,265

A2K1CBIRVQIRI4,23,I purchased a leather Kindle cover to protect my Kindle .which I love!. but instead of the elastic type holders on the Moleskine cover it had two brackets to attach the Kindle.  I was very gentle with it but the bracket caused a crack in my Kindle. and after awhile. another crack is opening at the other bracket!  So much for protecting my Kindle!And. I agree with all who think this cover is not useable for right handed people!,1,0,430
A2K1QRBOBJ3YM6,852,I couldnt be much happier with this unit. Where it really shines is in battery life. Ive used this in various 4x4 competitions and my teammates use some much larger. clunky handhelds that require 10 batteries and eat them up quick .several sets in a weekend.. I use 6 nicads in my midland unit and they last and last.Its a pretty decent mobile unit too with the adapter. With an external antenna the range is tremendously improved. My only real complaint is that I wish that there was a way to lock the backlighting on when using the car adapter  this would make it easier to use at night.,5,1,589
A2K4HQA1K0CVGP,1512,this Wall mount is easy to install and very good to move the TV to the angle you wantfor that reason I recommend it,4,1,115
A2K5FK58JSWXJ9,0,Littly pricy. but a great cable.  You will plug this in and never get  another. so why not get it?  You may want a longer one though. I just use  this from my cable modem to my router.,4,0,184
A2K5FK58JSWXJ9,1115,I think that this is one of the most used toys I own.  Great for taking in  my car to have a fresh sound every week. Great for taking for a jog or  working out in the gym .no skipping..  I only wish they included a ac  adapter plug. Plays music smooth and loud. great mp3 player!,5,1,279
A2K64K06EUZ65I,45,I did not particularly care for the product. The advertisement sounded great so I purchased tow of them. One did not work right out of the package. Returning the item for a replacement was not worth the shipping fee. so I threw it away. Sorry!,1,0,243

A2K84KKVY3M7CG,1,I am really getting a kick out of my new Cool Pix 950.  It a greatcamera. and with the rebate its a great deal too. Ive taken hundreds of pictures with it so far and like its sleek design that makes it easy to whip out of the case to shoot pictures on the fly.  One thing I thought was pretty lame was their CD manual.  I guess they thought theyd save some money by doing it this way.  When Im out with on a hiking trip with my camera and I need to find out some information...all I have to do is pop the CD into my computer. set up my solar battery array and run the CD...right? Someone at Nikon wasnt thinking about the customer. Im also thinking about getting a flash memory card reader for fast downloading to my computer.  The software that comes with the camera is too slow and wears on the batteries. All in all. the camera is a great picture taking device.,4,1,864
A2KBS91QLHRC4C,1517,These may save you money instead of buying the name brand or the store brand.  The setup was in the standard software packages.,4,1,127
A2KCDBB6F7IWZS,0,I too would agree with some of the negative points. but not all. As with many products. people will write a negative review when something doesnt work right but when a product is fine they wont write a review at all. My unit was made in 1998. I bought it in a beat up condition for USD20 from a pawn shop and as of April 26. 2011 it works as good as the day it was made. Since this product probably hasnt been available new for at least 10 years. Im writing this review for people who today might buy the PDF507 used but would be otherwise turned off by the bad reviews. Makes a great CD player for a second system or your garage stereo. or even a second CD player on your main system for shuffling 25 discs. Just be sure to test it first like I did if you find a used one. Incidentally. I bought the PDF507 to replace my PDF505 which one day decided to stop playing discs. As noted before. you cant add or take out discs when one is playing but with 25 in there who cares?,4,1,973
A2KDCY3G0D4X95,0,A nice tool to charge many new Verizon phones  the enV2 in particular  from any USB port.  Also it can be used to download data. songs. video. and pictures to your phone.  Far less expensive than directly from Verizon.  this should come stand with any phone you purchase. but alas. it does not.,5,1,294
A2KDJPCQWT6FF,22,I got the Rio 300 today and it is great. The setup is hard. then it gets easy. The machine will go on pause only if the volume is too high. It is light convinent and cool.,5,0,171
A2KDPUUGZ0U69O,46,This is a great camera for the price.  It was very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.  It took me about 15 minutes to figure out most of the cameras functions.  Only thing I have negative to say about  this camera is that Olympus should have included a ac adapter.,5,1,279
A2KE4Y8RZQ7P3L,1617,Both ends of the connections fit firmly like a glove. Excellent product with prompt delivery and GREAT customer service. Well worth the price. I search several electronic stores in the area and could NOT find any conversion connection constructed with the same quality for this price.,5,1,284
A2KESMAH4CX911,0,Great sound quality. even better reception. especially on A.M. You cannot buy a portable radio with reception this good at this price. I understand the C.Crane unit has awesome reception. but it is USD... I bought two SR3s for under USD... one for home. and one for work. I use it primarily on the A.M. band for news and sports. but music on F.M. sounds great too. Dont let the lack of digital tuning scare you away. this thing picks up stations you didnt even know were there. If you happen to live in an area where reception is particularly tough. the addition of a SelectATenna will improve performance. The SelectATenna can be purchased from a number of different online retailers. Just do a search and you will find one. Ive been told Terk makes a pretty good antenna too. but not having used one I cant really comment. Overall the GE Superadio 3 is a very good buy. If youre considering it. go ahead. spend the fifty bucks. You wont be disappointed.,5,1,955
A2KESMAH4CX911,1818,I bought this tape recorder for use as a study aid. and it has performed very well for this purpose. I like the fact that it uses full size cassette tapes. as they are readily available. and can be played back on any standard player. I have made several tapes. and have played them back in different decks with good results. The only thing I would recommend is the addition of an external microphone. as the internal mic seems to be too sensitive. It actually picks up noise from the tape drive mechanism. If this unit cost a lot of money. this would be a serious flaw. but for just over twenty bucks it didnt seem like a big deal to me. I picked up a decent mic at Radio Shack for around ten dollars. and recording quality is now flawless.,4,1,740
A2KESMAH4CX911,1516,I looked at a lot of shortwave portables before purchasing this unit. and I have been very happy with its performance. I got my feet wet in shortwave with a Sangean SG 622. but quickly outgrew it. I bought the YB 400pe with the idea that I would use it for a while. and then transition into something bigger and better. but it has performed so well I dont see that happening. This unit is a KEEPER! I really like the fact that everything you need is included in the box. AC adapter. external antenna. earphones. and carrying case. You can buy this radio for this price anywhere. Save yourself the wait .and possible damage. of UPS shipping. Just drive to your local Radio Shack and pick one up.,5,1,694
A2KEWYZA6O2C3O,1314,I have read through the other reviews and agree with few and disagree with most. Here is how.Disagree. It was said that the CDs wont load or they will skip. I have played 3 different home burned CDs in it in the last hour since I got it. no bad loads. no skips. The sound quality is great as long as you dont want to rattle the windows. It wont let you which I think is a great quality. .No. Im not old and grey. Im 21 and loud music is obnoxious.. It has a very stylish look. and the plastic looks very nice.Agree. When manually changing tracks. the CD DOES skip the intro to songs. Only real bad thing I have notice thus far. And I have played everything from Country to Classical to Heavy Metal on it now. no problems other than this.I would have to recommend this product. Its not a party system. its a good home stereo that wont have the neighbors calling the police on you.,4,1,879
A2KF43Z7ZGHP6R,1112,Its not the old rev where you can easily mod it for more channels. Buy it for all of the attachments. usability and great price.,4,1,128
A2KFPG90UL863J,1,When I first got it. it worked great.  But within a couple weeks. the cursor movement was erratic and soon got to the point where it was unusable.  So I pounded the .stuff. out of it and tossed it.,1,0,197
A2KG15Y4FMNFNM,34,I bought these headphones to use with a Yamaha portable keyboard. While they are lightweight and comfortable to wear. I found the volume of sound they produced too low to be usable. Even with volume of the keyboard at its highest setting. the sound coming out of the headphones was barely adequate. especially if there is ambient noise in the room.  I noticed that the sensitivity rating of these headphones is only 91 dBmW. while some other headphones have ratings above 100 dBmW. Maybe this is why the volume is so low.,2,0,521
A2KG2LQ62CBVV1,0,Knew it was used but it was advertised as nonskip.  It skips badly.  Had to buy a new one.,1,0,90
A2KG9VABMRYGBW,0,You are better served reading books or using a computerlaptop. This device flickers. freezes and then runs ahead to fast. and having problems uploading epub files also. May try Kindle or more recent Nook editions next.,2,0,218
A2KHMH994MZO2G,0,This product is the ideal for cleaning CDs or DVDs. You could ruin your player with the dust that falls off the CDDVD on to the lens. This is what happenned to my Pioneer DV525 player. This material does not act like any  normal material and make sure no harm can come to your DVD or player. If  you want to protect your investment .DVD or DVD Player. you must buy this.  It is almost a lifesaver.,5,1,397
A2KI16R97SFG7F,5258,I love the idea of this card. but I cant get it to work.  I have the little card inserted into the phone and I know how to go into my phone and follow the information from my phone instruction booklet on how to use the space on the phone. or the card. for photos or music.  However. I cant get it to work.  So. I am not giving up. since I recently succeeded in getting the phone to let me get onto YouTube. after a year of not letting me get there. unless I wanted to Chat with Hot Chicks .not so much. or buy Ringtones.  I couldnt get past that. although I did get onto YouTube several times when I first bought the phone.  Recently. I was able to do it and watch videos of songs I have selected on YouTube.  But. I think the MicroSDHC 4GB Card should come with instructions.  I have seen videos on YouTubeshowing you have to put the card into the phone. but that was it.  So. I am disappointed but hope that if this Review is published. someone may be able to help me.,3,0,970
A2KI66DFD40WL3,0,Dont waste your money. these headphones cant compete with USD10 corded headphones.  I was willing to accept some loss in sound quality to go cordless but these sound like a poorly tuned FM radio station.  Actual range is only about 40 feet through walls.  Get yourself a WalkmanDiskmanMP3 player instead.,1,0,304
A2KIMB0GGVVMN2,610,OK. Its little. useful. goes anywhere. easy to use.  But when i accidently lost the ELPHs battery cover on a recent trip to Florida and had to buy an emergency 35mm disposable for USD8. guess which pictures turned out best?  Grainy. poor color saturation. etc are my complaints of APS in general.  If  youre looking for great pictures. dont leave home without your SLR.

A2KJSVYNM1SV91,720,THIS CAMERA IS REALLY GREAT. ITS REALLY SMALL. AND I TAKE IT ANYWHERE I GO. AFTER ALMOST 2 YEARS IM HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM WHEN IM TAKING THE PICTURE. BUT I STILL LOVE IT.,4,1,172
A2KK14LTLA9DPK,0,Well it is nice. i just bought the wrong one. any ways it fits my tablet. and Im still using it.,3,0,96
A2KKTAKUWIEXC6,0,I found the nook to be very easy to navigate and work with. downloading books was a breeze.My issue with it is the touch screen  not only does it shorten the battery life considerably .compared to ereaders without an LCD display. its also not an antiglare surface.  And although the screen goes into sleep mode. most of the time I was far too distracted trying to find the right angle to hold it in my hands in order to avoid having my reflection andor the lights staring right back at me in my peripheral view.  When I did find the right angle to avoid reflections it was either uncomfortable to hold or too angled to read comfortably.This may not be a bother to everyone but in case youre peripherally sensitive like me you may want to think twice and consider another ereader.  I sold my nook on ebay and went for a different one after trying to give the nook a fair shot.,3,0,875
A2KKVYSLUE5JFR,6473,I have used this model for 8 months and it has plenty of audio and video .including SVideo. inputs.  It can record and play SVHS and VHS tapes.  with the former providing superior playback using the 2hours recording  mode and an SVHS tape.  It auto detects the tape type and has an easy to  use remote.  The best SVHS machine in this price range.,5,1,346
A2KLRCX2PMF1LA,1313,I thought this product worked fine until I got a speeding ticket last night.  Sure. it alerted me to radar on Ka band. after which I got pulled over.  The officer said. u0026quotYou were doing 63 in a 50MPH zone. right before you slowed down after your radar detector went off.  I got you half a mile before that thing went off.  The best thing you can do is throw that hunk of junk out the window.u0026quot  He then gleefully wrote me a ticked for speeding.  Thanks. Cobra!,1,0,474
A2KLZO1TWYMCHR,35,I bought the 1.8u0026quot TFT model and it works just fine..the stations come in nice and clear and the sound is decent too. I like the builtin stand and inputoutput jacks.  I had a Casio and this ones much nicer. A little larger than some but still pocket sized.,4,1,263
A2KMGOX0W8H8RV,1314,I bought this for my sister to replace her Hello Kitty usb keychain that had broken.  I was not pleased when it arrived.  It is large and gaudy.  The usd is not removable and is made of white plastic that does not match the owl.,2,0,228
A2KMP8ONPAUKR3,11,These are good quality video tapes. I am very pleased with them. Id recommend them to others looking for tapes to record things on.,4,1,131
A2KN963I0269YQ,0,The surface not slippery. its easy hold in hand. The size could be reduced on 5mm. Magnets are perfect. they fix cover securely if its turned out.,4,1,146
A2KNLAL3WMS87U,0,I VERY LIKE THIS LITTLE COMPUTER. SOMETIMES I DONT WANT TO GET ON THE DESK TOP OR EVEN THE LAPTOP. SO THIS IS VERY CONVENIENT.GREAT!,4,1,132
A2KNTYVLNH4QQ3,0,Good quality and gets the job done well. I didnt get a choice on my color thigh. I ended up with black so I wasnt to fussed about it. Not bad overall.,4,1,150
A2KO7C7ZPZNDUS,0,I bought the Diamond Rio 300 Player and I love it.  Its is so portable its unbelievable.  One tip though. the speakers that come with it arent that good.  The plug doesnt fit in well you have to shove it in.  By the  way. if you see that your player keeps pausing it is because your volume is  up too high.,5,1,306
A2KOJ0BUVBBI8L,12,Bought them last week.The magnification is good but there is no adjustment of zoom. I tried to look at birds and other distant objects but unless you know exactly where to focus. you wont be able to see them. There is no way to zoom out and then slowly zoom in.I am returning them today.,3,0,287

A2KQCAF1YG54CE,1,At the time of writing this review. the title for this item describes this cable as HDMI version 1.4 3D capable. The cables received are version 1.3a. which are incapable of 3D pass through.They are however still a pretty great bang for the buck .including shipping.. even for 1.3as.,2,0,283
A2KQETKPHZZBPU,0,Much the same as JustAce2006 said.Not OEM Samsung. though it is the same size and shape as the picture.Works fine with GSM Galaxy Nexus.Does require power to the adapter. as far as I know. they all do .for my phone..Set your TVs overscanscanaspect ratio if the picture seems a little cropped and make sure your phonetablet is charged up or it might not work.,3,0,358
A2KQS56WCGQL5W,12,I think this is so super easy to work with. I gave mine to my daughter to enjoy while abroad.,4,0,93
A2KR372GZW00MJ,11,It is a good value. but is not top notch quality. If you extend both arms in the same direction. the TV .30 inch. tilts. However if the arm goes right. then left. the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great.,4,1,223
A2KRTJTK0B5O9,0,Great little radio. range is acceptable with the provided antenna. but an external antenna would make it reach out a to an exxellent distance.  Volume is lacking when used with an external speaker. Price is right for the unit and delivery was fast.,4,1,248
A2KRV0TPC1LLXW,11,This scanner is Unidens answer to key complaints about their first generation u0026quotTrunk Trackeru0026quot scanners.  The BC245XLT will now track multiple trunked radio systems simultaneously. it will scan  conventional and trunked systems simultaneously. and it will now track  EDACS .TM. trunked radio systems.Other new features include computer  interface port. u0026quotSmart Scanneru0026quot programmability via telephone  modem .a feature requiring a 900number call at USD0.99min... and cloning  capability.Otherwise. this radio is similar in operation and  functionality to its predecessor. the BC235XLT.  It features 300 channels.  12 band coverage from 29956 MHz .excluding cellular and 512806MHz..  Service Search. attenuator. automatic display lighting. and other unique  features.On the downside. the radio delays for 5 seconds between  scanning trunk systems even if no signals are detected.Overall. this  is a great radio for the money.  It is the best available technology for  scanning enthusiasts who want to monitor the modern trunked radio systems  in use by numerous public service agencies worldwide.,4,1,1124
A2KRV0TPC1LLXW,3537,This is Unidens base station equivalent of their popular first generation handheld Trunktracker scanner.  The 895 can track ONLY one trunked system at a time and while doing so excludes all conventional frequencies you  might have programmed.  The Scan List function .memory for storing favorite  trunking talk groups. is limited to 50 slots. and that may be too few slots  to accommodate large metro area trunk systems.,4,1,420
A2KS0FVY2CNJ8M,2025,Ive had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries 3 times. and a third battery once. So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 .Luxeon Rebel LED. 11  200 lumens.. and a Fenix P1 CE .Cree 7090 XRE LED  90 lumens.. For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 112 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels Im using. I dont use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so thats plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included. too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory cardbattery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 111409I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few chargerecharge cycles .which is what is supposed to happen.. so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11172010I guess its time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but thats because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer .2010.. I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off .that how you replace the battery.. I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well. it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didnt have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn. and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately. the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine  still had a full charge! Ive since charged it twice and it is still working great. STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,4,1,2534
A2KT9HKOMTIVLJ,6770,I work for a haunted house in October. I am a manager and lead the technical crew. Our headsets we ordered only worked for one evening. We returned for work the next afternoon and the headsets did not function. The headset I used the night before that I put back on my desk with my radio in my charger  I could only hear squealing and my PTT button was inoperable. All was fine the night before when I signed off air through our head security officer. But then it worked. I had no trouble with it.,2,0,497
A2KTX32KFHPTK7,0,I bought my Sharp722 about 2 months agao. and I honestly have to say it is the best protable music system Ive ever seen. I have heard the Sharp702 had problems. and it  dosent have the edit functions of the 722. This  player has a nice display. great sound and recording options. IT also has  the added bonus of a huge battery life. as well as 3 power options. IT has  a great range of accesories included. however you might need to buy a  stereostereo cable at Radio Shack for 3 bucks. The rechargable battery is  tiny. and holds 10 hours of play time. Teh jog shuttle control is easy to  use and very efficient. The headphones ore addaquate. but you might want to  buy a really sup.erb pair. All in all this is an excelent buy. and much  less expensive then comprable Sony moddles.,5,1,783
A2KTXU9RHXIJCE,1818,I did not do my due diligence before ordering this mouse.  It was designed for Windows 98 and does not even have a scroll button.  I was looking for one to replace the one I had for the last few years.  I dropped that one and it broke.  I should have paid more attention to the specifics for this mouse and less to the price. I will make myself use it for awhile since it is my own fault.  Maybe I will run into what I really want on sale one of these days.No problem with delivery on time. etc.,3,0,495
A2KUEGMSLHUNNP,0,Bought this mount for a 32inch Panasonic LED TV. The mount may look cheap. but I found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price. I strongly recommend it to everyone.,5,0,180
A2KVCCCR0CEBXH,0,I was so excited to get this but when I plug it in. it constantly humsalmost to a white noise volume. Any suggestions?,2,0,118
A2KWADODPKYY34,37,Unlike other recivers in its price range you dont get the quality as you do with the technics  SAAX530 model reciver. Other recivers only have 3 input jacks this one has 5 including a special dvd one which lets you hook  up six speakers to it. including sub woofer. center channel two front and  two back speakers.Other feature I like about this product is that there is  a 30 channel memory on it so if your listening to fm. you dont need to use  the direct tunning button you just press the channel you want.You can also  set delays on the speakers which is a nice feature.The remote is also multi  fuctional so if you misplace you dvd remote chance are this remote will  also work on it because it has a little dvd section on it which i like  alot. over all this is a great reciver to get if its your first or its in  your price range or your looking for a better quality reciver this is the  one for you.,5,1,908
A2KXAIGFP0K838,3638,I bought one for a friend since I was very happy with my Rio 300.  However the new Rio500 didnt work at all.  It ate batteries at the rate of one per  hour and skipped around through songs randomly.  My replacement is one the  way.  To be continued....,2,0,252
A2KYC21WDNY5L,6,Works like a charm. I have used it on two computers and it has worked well on both. I am able to transfer data from the floppies to my hard drive.I would recommend it.,4,1,167
A2KZFZELYPBONK,0,First the good. these inserts print nicely and accurately in Sure Thing deluxe disk labeling software.Also they can be had from Amazon for a little over half the price of a prominent local office supply store.Next the bad and the ugly. if preparing a large group of CD cases. the time spent separating the cards really adds up.  It would have made sense for Memorex to perforate the tops and bottoms of each card all the way across the sheet.  Instead. perforations starting at the top and bottom have to be carefully followed. especially at the bottom where it is possible to tear a little too far and tear into the card itself.,3,0,629
A2L1952851U34G,11,I bought a black protector for my Lenovo T510 to help protect it from spills. Overall I am pleased with the item. but it wasnt a perfect fit to the keys on the keyboard. Regardless. it does cover the majority of the sensitive area. Seller was quick to respond to questions. great customer service! Would recommend this product and seller.,4,1,338
A2L3DMH0ANNTGI,0,This antenna works OK. but only if you need short range communications.My main complaint is with the company that resells this product. Because they have no idea what radio antennas are. I was shipped the incorrect antenna. After a few emails explaining my problem. I was assured I would be refunded my shipping costs of the wrong product back to the company. I was never credited with that cost.I would suggest you find another company that is more ethical in their business practices.,3,0,486
A2L3OAPBMBGHHD,1416,I bought the wall charger because I bring my Garmin into the house each night.  I thought it would be easier to have it charge at night for use the following day. Now I dont need to use the car charger unless the battery gets low during extended use.,5,1,250
A2L4MJ5NFM1I8V,1516,When I received my VHS cleaner. I inserted it. nothing came up. no window. nothingit ran for maybe 15 sec. and it ejected. . It did nothing. I tried rewinding it that did not work. So I just stopped trying.I do not recomend  this product to anyone.tightwad75,1,0,258
A2L7AM2A6QP60C,0,After doing much research I have made my final conclusion.  I think this is a all around good card.  But compared to GeForce and Diamond Stealth this card is nothing.  It does not deliver nearly as many frames per  second.and I would not recommend it if you are a very serious Gamer.  But  dont get me wrong it is a pretty good card.,3,0,333
A2L7Y1X37I1M6L,3,It did ok but it wasnt as good as Id hoped. Granted not many of us use or have combo cdcassette players but we still need head cleaners that work.  For the price it did alright.,3,0,177
A2L802OQB1JKN2,1,Any USB cable these days will do.  But nothing will do printing better than this one.

A2LA9AUI24V7BA,140,My model doesnt have that W on the end and does not have aconvenient headphone jack.  Oh well  paid the USD5 for a splitter  amessy fix but it works.  Just noticed that it scanned with the W on the end of the model  I figured it meant white.  E=mailed Yamaha  this model does not and will never have a headphone jack.  Pretty weird.  Still sounds real good and Im keepin.,5,1,371
A2LAAG2AO9BYG9,19,I ordered a different model of this product and encountered the apparently common error messages about needing to format each floppy disk I tried to open. Once I contacted Sabrent. they were quick to send me this model as a replacement at no extra charge. Then I successfully retrieved the files I needed from my old floppy disks. Im glad it worked out!,4,1,353
A2LANQKLGOBBQU,0,I purchased this item so I could place a fax machine in a room that didnt have an phone jack  It works excellent.  I have the flexibility to move the fax machine anywhere.  this is an excellent product and it works great.,5,1,221
A2LBTFSYHHP02V,1920,I have a Kindle and I am very happy with it. but I also wanted the Nook. Just as I dont see the need to choose between PC and Mac and just keep one of each around. I dont see that this is a fight that is necessary. There are a handful of books for Nook that I cant get on Kindle. and a bit more than a handful of books on Kindle I cant get on the Nook.The device is beautiful. I love the solid rubber backing. The aluminum backing on the Kindle sure looks nice but on a cold Colorado night I do prefer the rubber. It is really nice to see the book cover in full color and with the 1.2 update they just pushed out the device is just as snappy as I would want. Sure its not going to win any speed contests. but its supposed to be simulating a book. Not exactly a high speed sport. Page turns seem to be just the same or only very slightly slower than my Kindle 2.The free comedic articles in the Daily section are quite funny and the intersting things that pop up when you take it into a Barnes and Noble store are quite fun.I am disappointed in some of the ommisions from the book store though. EVE. The Empyrean Age and the JPS Students Tanakh were two things that I have on my Kindle that I read often that are no where to be found on the Nook. In fact there are no Tanakhs at all for the Nook. but a good bakers dozen Christian Bibles. If I were more paranoid Id probably be offended by that.I do like the fact that the nook can take ePub books though. I can always pop over to Diesel Books and purchase my missing books and transfer them straight over. which takes a bit of the sting out of the missing library.All in all I would recommend the Nook to anyone who lives near a Barnes and Noble. I am just not quite sure I could recommend it over and above the Kindle at the moment. Perhaps if and when they expand their book selection that could change.,4,1,1855
A2LD7LIWQ738CG,22,When I bought these batteries I understood that they had an output voltage of 3v. After charging all four I tested them with a volt meter and found they are at 3.63.9v. I thought the idea was a regulated output of 3.03.2v. Not satisfied with this product.,2,0,255
A2LE3K89Z74MBK,1025,This Nook is amazing. It works perfectly. it has a great battery life. and the fact that it is not backlit makes my heart sing. Its tiny. portable. and even with my case fits perfectly in my purse for my morning commute. I love this product. and I recommend it to EVERYONE.,5,1,273
A2LEJXMBN5LQ3L,22,my friend has the sony530. and its not fun having the sound and pic out of sync. thats why i just bought the Toshiba. the 5.1 will blow you away. and the picture quality is very good. dual tray is nice also.

A2LFB90Y3UVD3K,0,The product is easy to install but I was not particularly impressed with the display clarity on the television.  I also had to spend quite a bit of time reseting my monitor after the install process.  Finally. the written  instructions were okay but could have been better. i.e. written for rookies  and veterans.,2,0,313
A2LG0LV5RI86F0,15,Ive token about 1000 pictures with this camera. and I still like it. Youre taking more photos because it.s small enough to keep it with you when you want. No more weight and place as needed from now on. Quality is  very good. especially for the price. Here in Europe the camera is not that  expensive .350 dollar.. so bying it at amazon.com is maybe not that  sheep.... though... you should buy it if you like carrying your camera  whereever you go...,5,1,451
A2LGCVAXMP06AP,25,I was recently very lucky to receive this digital camera as a gift for my birthday.  Having had an ordinary 35 mm camera previously this camera is like a dream come true.  Excellent pictures. easy to review after taking them and extremely easy to operate.  All the instructions are straightforward and the controls are very simple to use even for someone like me who is a basic amateur photographer.  Within a few weeks of having the camera I have taken some wonderful photos.  I have found uploading them extremely easy especially in conjunction with Photosuite III.,4,1,567
A2LGTML989JKHU,44,I love mine. But there are glitches that come up. I had to replace my first one with a no hassle easy and quick replacement. I did have to send mine back first. But It would no turn on anyway so I couldnt use it. The replacement has lasted longer. But sometimes the WiFi turns on by itself. Sometimes its just flighty about picking up signal no matter where I am. this happens in phases. especially after I have had to erase and deregister it. I have had to do that six times with this one. in order to get things to work properly. The Bluetooth drains the battery even though it is off. .I own a off brand Bluetooth keyboard. which may have began that problem.. These problems drain the battery quite quickly so I my batter doesnt last. And my chargers are quite new. I called to have this second one replaced but there was a display issue with the third one and the headphone jack didnt work so I sent that back. I have stuck with my second one. I know this sounds like a mouth full of problems. But I am always satisfied with the customer service. I know that if I have any serious lasting problems. they will replace it. and also the new year of warranty starts over as soon as I receive the replacement. not dating back to my first one. which I have had since Mothers day 2013.Good things are. the google play enhancement. I use mine so often and it is an excellent tablet for USD129. I really enjoy using it for every day utility. budgeting. notes. personal upkeep. audio and regular books. The possibilities seem endless.,4,1,1528
A2LGWXN29YADLL,11,With the reputation of the Zoom name. this modem is outstanding. The ease to install and register was simply amazing. The Zoom modem has an extremely fast connection and with features like the lightening gaurd protection. I  would highly recommend this modem.,5,1,259

A2LH6N4U1XCX6R,0,After reading other reviews. I got this unit over the Cobra. If mounting is a priority for you get the Cobra. Im having a hard time to get this mounted in a clean way like the Cobra would be. Other then that it word fine.,3,0,221
A2LHZKX1R0HW2M,1,It came early which is nice. it didnt come with a box which was already described in the details. but It was nice. came as described and worked fine.,4,1,149
A2LIZECHRMJAEI,0,560D. This is my first review of any product on AMZN.  I had to add a comment after reading the other reviews.  I AM NOT ALONE!!  These errors have been a continual headache. and from what I see from the reviews. turning to Sony will be to no avail.  Ah well. Sony has lost a DVD customer.  I have the Wega which is a great picture so Im not uniformly prejudiced against Sony products.  And the DVD player when it has worked has been great. But the hitches have increased in frequency until lately I simply get No disc error.  The reader scans back and forth for about 20 seconds until it gives up.  And Im giving up. too.  I am very surprised that a lot of people have this same problem... points to a generalized issue which I hope Sony can take care of.,1,0,756

A2LJV2DIW1220H,0,Well the nook serves its purpose well. It is great in high levels of bright sun light and even does well in the shade. Battery life is amazing and the nook library is defiantly growing. Love the whole idea of narrowing books from friends and your local library.,5,1,261
A2LKBKOYAUW09O,22,I guess I shouldnt have expected too much in terms of battery life from this digital camera.  Like most DCs. this one was also a battery hog. but until I purchase a camera with a longlife Liion battery that is  stupidlyheavy. I shouldnt expect 3 months of uninterrupted use.Other  than my beef with power usage. this camera is perfect in every way.  Just  the right amount of magnification .and more is purchaseable via addon  lenses.. and the quality could not be better for the price.  Definitely  worth my time and money.,4,1,524
A2LM4GO5DH1NPX,36,I bought one of these so I could video chat when Im travelling back to 2001. Unfortunately. when travelling. once the capacitor activated. the radiation from the 1.21 gigawatt flux dispersal fried the components in the camera. Perhaps Ill try again with a Mr. Fusion drive. If it fries again I can always sell it to a trank should their thumbprint process.,1,0,356
A2LMS16TCQ1UW9,12,If you buy any card from ATI. this is what you can expect.  1. the card might. or might not work on the operating system of choice. particularly NT4. or NT2000 or might be severely limited. 2. almost nonexistent customer service 3. you get to test their software and drivers since they dont seem to do that before releasing. 4. you get to hang out with lots of other angry users in the newsgroups.  5. tvout is no better than most other scan converters 6. dvd playback is consistently better and less troublesome with other cards. like hollywood magic 6. you can get a better performing graphics card for much less than this card.,1,0,630
A2LMVRUCHB6G8K,34,Well built. Thumb screws are very ergonomic. I use these cables with standard external modems like the USRobotics 56K faxmodems. Good value for the money.,5,0,154
A2LNEDA3J12TPY,11,When I first purchased this last November. I thought it to be a super  purchase .that is for except for the cheesy looking headphones. which I  tossed in the trash on day one..  It was great for my daily train ride into  Manhattan.  I could walk with it to the office with minimal skips. However.  2 months ago. it just stopped working.  After reviewing the warranty  information. I saw a 3 month warranty.  Most reviewers indicated they loved  the features and the price.  You get what you pay for folks.  Hello  Sony...Ive learned my lesson..,1,0,544
A2LNMSC2EBQKWF,4852,I have used this in my truck. van. and home DVD and it works great.  My truck CD player was skipping and this cleared up whatever problem it was having.,4,1,152
A2LNQGHLPIT20G,0,I found the Sony KV53S65 53u0026quot Projection TV to be the best value among similar size projection TVs. I compared the Sony against comparable RCA. Toshiba. and Phillips models. The Picture was much sharper than other  models. I found the Red. Green. and Black colors to be more pure than more  expensive Phillips and RCA models. I realy like the front SVideo input for  easy hookup of my DVD. I also especialy enjoyed the layout of the remote  control compared to RCA remotes I have used previously .The buttons were  not layed out logicaly on other remotes I have used..,4,1,575
A2LO26RUD8RCXH,66,I have had this unit for a little over a year. using it infrequently. It started having problems playing some tracks on even new CDs. and now it wont play anything.,1,0,164
A2LOMQQDS3MPN0,46,Out of the box this e reader is perhaps the worst piece of electronics i have purchased.  It claims to have support for common image formats such as jpg and bmp but in actuality it does not. The only way it can display an image is through its screen saver which would be ok except the screen saver can not be cycled and pops up a random picture from a folder so there is no way to view a specific file.  If you try to access any images from a folder it will give you an error saying  this nook cannot read this file.  It may be an unsupported format.  I have tried both bmp and jpg formats from different sources and received the same error even though the screen saver can read and display the very same files.It also claims to support PDF files which it sort of displays but it will not let you zoom in on a pdf. The reader also can not be put into  landscape mode which makes the text of most pdfs so small they are impossible to read.  Also when showing a pdf they arent even expanded to take up the full screen making it even harder to read them.Barns and noble  leaked  the fact that there is a hidden browser built into the nook but this browser is so buggy that you cant even do a simple google search on it. The browser is so useless that it would have been better to not include it at all so you could have a bit more storage space which brings me to my next point.  Out of the 2 GB on board memory you are only able to access and store 250 MB of info.Another disappointing aspect of the device is its battery life.  The Battery although fairly good at 1 month is much shorter then the 2 months stated for the device.  Had the appropriate 1 month battery life been stated i wouldnt have a problem with this but stating it lasts 2 months on a single charge is a drastic over statement of its capabilitys especially when it would drain in under this time just siting in standby.The reader only has two things going for it.  First it has an micro SD memory card slot which is necessary sense it has so little space for storage and this device can be rooted .which will void your warranty.. Once you root it software can be installed which allows you to over come most of the devices shortcomings but rooting it voids your warranty and is in no way officially supported.  Rooting can be a long task if your not use to android terminology although if your already familiar with developing on android its a pretty simple process.  Rooting also drastically reduces battery life dropping it from approximately 1 month battery life to 3 days or so with the standard android install but this can be brought back up to 12 weeks battery life by modifying a few of the system files.,1,0,2679
A2LP0YA12TEU6,12,I purchased this Koss radio because it was small. lightweight. and had a stop watch feature which would be perfect to use during my workouts at Green Lake in Seattle.  I was so excited when it arrived. but my excitement  quickly changed to disappointment the first time I tried to use it and  didnt get any reception.  I know there is great reception at Green Lake  because I have a larger Walkman that works just fine.  My advice to  potential buyers would be... Dont waste your time. you will likely be as  disappointed as I am!,1,0,530
A2LR3NKEAVTTSE,2223,I take this in my gym bag  toss it on the bottom. throw it around and it still works great!  Ive had BAD luck with Sony  I think their products have decreased in quality lately.  I think the reception is fine .though I  only use it to listen to the rebroadcast of the TV sound at the health  club.  It is an inexpensive radio  if you dont need anything fancy   this is your best bet.,4,1,383
A2LR9WP2JGDT8E,2830,The mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate. The holes dont align so I couldnt put two screws in. I just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment. Then I used zip ties to secure the arm better. I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also. the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again. I did a quick fix. I gave this 2 stars and not 1 because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv. albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount. I should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this.,2,0,804

A2LSCZVCMLS9QC,1,After a day of hiking in the sun. my brain must have been fried.  I took off from the trail head with the GPS on the roof of the truck.  At about 40MPH. aerodynamics finally took over as it was swept off and fell to the  highway.  After reinstalling the antenna. it still worked fine.  Only minor  scratches.  At least I finally figured out how to get the antenna off.  Aside. the controls are not always intuitive.  Plan on reading the manual.,4,1,444
A2LSYKJZBRLLD7,1314,Clever design. but would not work in my Mac laptop PCMCIA slot.,2,0,63
A2LT6XRP47D8ZK,0,They look pretty cool and get the job done but they are not as Maxell has them pictured. The only colored part is the single plastic piece inside while the two outer layers are clear and just as any other jewel case.Also. if you are wanting to place the inlets behind the colored piece. good luck doing so without cracking or even breaking it as its jammed in there really tight.,3,0,379

A2LXFSSBFJ6QWX,0,Dont spend your hard earned money on this ext. floppy drive the drive wont read half the disks you insert into itand.also drive is Loud . the floppy disks are new undamaged. look elsewhere and spend a little extra. the drive when you insert the floppy disks asks you if you want to format the disk ? No.. all I want is for the floppy drive to recognize the disk and open it. but it doesnt. I am Very disappointed in the quality and workman ship of this drive..Dont waste your time,2,0,480
A2LYMA5JDWO04I,12,You cant believe how much this makes reading fun!Responsive screen. sleek design. great customization .for margins. fonts. line spacing. etc... and more!This doesnt have all the bells and whistles. it is just an ereader. Thats what its for!,5,1,240
A2LZ3HGE6UMSQF,22,This is one of those products where you can never be completely sure if it is doing anything. But I just finished using it for the 40th time. after which it is recommended that you buy a new one. and all the playersburners Ive used it on seem to be in fine working order. Whether they would be working as well if I didnt periodically clean them is impossible to say.The disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipments lens. It takes about one minute. There are also some additional features which I have never used.,5,1,530
A2LZJBNSJTZSZL,1923,I bought one of these for myself several years ago and love it.  I purchased this one as a gift.,5,0,96
A2LZJYPXHR8PV0,22,Cant believe that there are so many people with the same complaint.  My DEFCON computer lock just decided to stop working.  How are these people still able to sell this product???  Really wish I would have had this information before purchasing this awful lock.,1,0,261
A2LZO2XIZI8CAW,0,I found the Nook I was looking for and I ordered it. It works great and was everything it said it was.,4,1,102
A2M0MYAOZXA6GT,11,After getting my Palm V I had the fear of dropping it and breaking it. That problem is solved here with this nifty hard case. The case itself is very nice looking. It comes in different colors .I got the regular silver one. and is sleek. This doesnt add on a lot of size or weight to your Palm V. Which is a main reason a lot of people got it for.The case is sturdy and does protect as per my experience when I accidentally dropped my Palm V. I picked it up. dusted it off. turned it on with nothing amiss. It is also nice that it prevents it from accidentally turning on while in your pocket or purse or what not. Also if you forget to turn it off then this allows the Palm to auto turn off thus saving power.It also fits on your hot syncing cradle. All you have to do is elevate the cradle .ie put it on top of a book. and then open the case front and back and voila. fits right on. The case also has a small cutaway in the top to make room for the IR. This case is well worth the price that Amazon has it for. Get it and you will not be sorry when one day you drop your Palm and get saved by this.,5,1,1100
A2M1J3GY17T0ZM,45,... I do not understand.  But Im glad that I found these tapes.  Excellent quality.  Should last and last and last.,5,0,115
A2M1ML844ND52V,0,I had heard of people having problems with this drive. so I was a little wary when it arrived. but I had no reason to be. It worked in true PlugandPlay fashion with no problems whatsoever. The slim. lightweight design is perfectly suited to my laptop. it records fast enough that i dont sit there forever tapping my fingers. and does everything I require. Definitely worth the purchase.,4,1,386
A2M22VLO8WO13Z,1920,I was very reluctant to give up real books. But after getting my nook I realized all the space Ive been saving by not having a bookshelf. I t also makes it easier to read laying down when you dont have to use both heads to awkwardly hold up the book. The nook is very light and easy to carry around with you .,4,1,309
A2M2EBNNKHHQSK,0,After shopping for months and months. i dicided to get this sony model. and i dont regret it one bit.  This picture is crystal clear. and the remote makes it worth the price of admission.  I paid 399 for it at circuit city .sorry amazon!.  Go out and but this one now!,5,1,268
A2M2H943WTKUQF,2428,I wait awhile before I write a review of my purchases. This one I have had for a month and it works better than I expected I wish it was a slightly different color but this color was cheaper so...I looked at various plastic ones that offered the same or fewer features. but this one wears well and it protects my Kindle from when I am reading. I drift off. asleep and drop it.I must point out that I am new to reading on electronics and have little experience to make comparisons,4,1,479
A2M2IQNCKGTQUY,0,I checked four local stores in my area for this cable and they all wanted a very high price for this item. I checked the Internet and found I could get it for only 13 the cost of what my local stores wanted. So I purchased it through Amazon. and with the freight included. it only cost me a third of what my local stores wanted. The cable is of high quality and works great. The connectors on the end are easy to operate. no problems. It sure pays to check the Internet for prices on an item before buying an item at your local store.,5,1,534
A2M2MQ8KD7SFHD,33,I used the cleaning tape in my truck and it didnt work.  It was a waste of money to order it.,1,0,93
A2M2P01XSZNSUK,35,This type of case is not very well made. When you drop the phone the case itself breaks!! Even when you just take the case off the phone you can break the little nubs off that hold the case securely onto the phone. The only part of this case I enjoyed was the design. it was very fun!,2,0,284
A2M3E53LN2CQT6,0,This is good product compared to its price. Im using it for watching video. writing documents. and web searching. Its perfect for my needs. and I upload CM 1.0. so now Im using it with Android... Its so good. ..,5,1,211

A2MB0PZ7VYLRNX,11,I purchased this to do voice recording since the earbudheadphones are unwieldy and get in the way.  However. it does NOT work with my 32GB iTouch 3rd Generation .Part number MC008. Model number A1318..  Check your box and the back of your ipod before you buy this. and make certain you dont have the above model.I am severely disappointed. and will not purchase any further iTouch items unless they are specifically for my model.,1,0,429
A2MC7RY883X0KJ,22,I purchased this player because it was cheap it has Component video out and DTS. the setup is nice and the video output is good but nonDTS audio is much better on my A300 Panasonic. Playing the DTS version of Saving Private Ryan was simply awesome playing through my Klipsch  KSF10.5 mains. KSW300 sub. KSFC5 center and bipolar Klipsch rears. I  really like Digital 5.1. but DTS is definitely better! The build quality  isnt what I expected and Sonys move to a single laser worried me. well  see how this machine fares in the months to come.,4,1,541
A2MCWX4D0H9GG7,0,I must have received a very used one it is not reliable at all.  It is just like one I had. but my old one never failed me until it was nearly 20 years old!!!!!!!!!!!,2,0,166
A2MD3I54PWK7DV,0,I was looking for an external dvd player so my kids could watch dvds on my Asus Eee netbook. and that is exactly what I got. I was nervous about the product when I ordered it because some of the negative reviews said it didnt play DVDs. only CDs. My netbook has Windows 7 starter edition. which doesnt come with a dvd media player. so I went online to cnet.com and downloaded VLC media player for free. which allowed my netbook to play DVDs. When I plugged in the DVD player. it worked right away without any problems. I suspect that is the same problem the negative reviewers were having. it wasnt the dvd player that didnt work. it was their media player. Additionally. the machine is quiet and doesnt rattle or make a lot of noise. I couldnt hear the disc spinning. and I had to put my hand on top of it to feel it vibrating. If what you are looking for is a play only external DVDCD player. this product is great. and a good value for the money. Plus. it arrived very quickly. I ordered it on a sunday and it arrived the following wednesday.,4,1,1045
A2MEZ87KU8RZ88,11,Works great for accessing files .read and write. on legacy 3.5 inch disks. since todays computers no longer include this type drive.,4,1,132

A2MFVJSA7UTQF6,4953,Captures great in a Sony TR7000 camcorder. Works great in both Hi8 and  Digital8 modes. though only captures 60 minutes in Digital8 format.

A2ML1MP0BJMA7U,0,The No Name FABP Rechargeable NiMH Battery Pack for Cobra FRS u0026 GMRS Radios that I purchased for under USD4.00 is not worth the powder to blow them to h**l. The original batteries would last for 24 hrs. These only last for 4 hrs. and that is only on standby. Beware of this product.Wayne,1,0,291
A2MLDGXOLRZ1X3,33,I havent used it for the purpose I bought it for since I returned my tablet already for not being functioning as advertised. Most of the new tablets that come along with HDMI port have a type D i.e. Micro HDMI and I am afraid if this purchase is going to be a waste of money unless I could get a decent tablet with mini HDMI port. Did check this cable to see if it works with my Canon DSLR camera. Other than mirroring the camera LCD. I couldnt find any usefulness if it so far. Will be updating once I start using it for some tablet in future.,3,0,544
A2MLE5H35UXP2Q,2,The mount itself seems well constructed.  I was hesitant about having only one brace against the wall to support a 40 inch tv but it seems to work.The only downside is that the beam above my fireplace is centered on the wall and to the fireplace... when the arm is completely folded and the tv is as close to the wall as possible. the arm does not line up with the mount.  The center point of the tv is not inline to where the mount is screwed into the wall. SO my tv is off centered.Mount is screwed into beam. centered. When arm is retracted or folded fully to keep the tv against the wall. the tv center is off. it is next to the mount against the wall.Hope this makes sense.Other than that it works,4,1,702
A2MLRPJAFTZ3W6,0,I just brought this modem tonight I attempted to install it in my parents computer. The modem was not detected automatically by Windows as proclaimed in the manual. nor could I get it to be detected from the Win95 Control PanelAdd New Hardware function. I saw the reviews of the other  people here on Amazon.com and I agree with their assessment.  I do not have  a Pentium MMX and at a minimum the u0026quotsocalled manual should have  mentioned the MMX requirement.  Even though I paid USD for it from  Staples and Ive watched the DallasNew England game .while installing.. I  never had problems such as this before.  Im taking it back promptly  tomorrow.,1,0,656
A2MLXORECPVV23,88,this product was not what was shown in the picture what i got was just one long cord what was shown in the picture was a coiled cord or what is said was suppose to be a snagless molded patch cable which is what i wanted to just hook my ethernet switch to my router and not have a mile of cord left over and well i have a mile of cord leftover would of been real nice to have gotten what was shown in the picture. What I received was not a snagless nor was is molded or a patch cable it was just a short cat 5e cable.,3,0,516
A2MO5GWRX48POV,11,I bought this DVD player 6 months ago for my Moms Birthday. which was a few days ago. I always buy early and wanted to take advantage of all the deals around Christmas. The first time we plug it in we get the menu and the DVD starts. Then nothing. I have 40 DVDs and every single one doesnt work. I get a no disc error. Tried returing it to RCA and they say no! I have to pay some huge labor fee. I am past amazons return policy. so basically i spent all this money and havnt even gotten one single use out of it! This is the second DVD player we have owned and it ....stinks.! we bought one for ....less money. at target that has lasted over a year and works perfectly! Do NOT BUY RCA!,1,0,686
A2MOHLO9XB2H4L,1010,The dry cleaner destroyed the picture. then the wet cleaner destroyed the unit.Complete and utter garbage. I should sue for the value of the vcr.,1,0,145
A2MOZBDN1DI4AY,23,This product looked goodIn fact. it appeared almost identical to the last disc cleaner I bought .which worked well for years..  However. it is total crap.  The stupid thing doesnt want to turn once youve closed the lid.  It will turn fine while you have it open. and are checking to make sure nothing is wrong.  However. once you close it. the stupid thing wont work.,1,0,367
A2MPKE7P1DFYTK,23,Kensingtons products are. in my experience. well worth the moneythey are EXTREMELY wellmade and tech support is topnotch. I find the Orbit very comfortable and the included software allows a lot of control and customization .Ive used this trackball on both Windows and Mac OS.. As far as physical quality of the product. only Logitechs input devices come close.As with any input device. its best to try this one on for size before you buy. I find it very comfortable and a good way to minimize jointrelated problems in my right wrist and hand. but the only way to figure out whether its comfortable for you is to try it out in person. preferably in a store where you can compare it sidebyside with other ones.,5,1,709
A2MPKE7P1DFYTK,22,Nice controls. a solid chassis. easy to use remote.  The standout feature for me is that the transport is absolutely silent when playingno hiss or hum from the motors .I mean if you put your ear up to the component itselfnot the lack of noise on the audio outputs. which should be a given with any but the cheapest disc player..  The errorcorrection algorithms are excellentI played some badly scratched CDs that other players could not handle and could barely hear the data interpolation at the scratch points.  I would give it five stars but for two things .1. occasional speaker pop on powerup .easily resolved if you use a delay circuit or just turn your power ampreceiver on last when powering up your system.. and .2. limited programmingplayback optionsthere doesnt seem to be any way to set the unit to play just a single CD straight through .without creating a program containing all the tracks of that CD..  The internal DAC is not bad. and of course the optical output lets you hook up your DAC of choice.  Bottom line. this is a GREAT bargain in Red Book changers. well worth searching out used or as a liquidation special since it seems to have been discontinued and not replaced with an improved model .what is JVC thinking?..,4,1,1239
A2MQ1NGA4OQIOY,22,Received this tablet from my wife for Christmas.  I had done a fair amount of research and decided on this one Thanksgiving weekend.  Happened to go to Bu0026N website and there they were..on sale for USD79.00!!  This tablet is the best value out there IMO.I also purchased a AFN micro sd card to make this unit a full  Android  tablet.  I can dual boot from the startup screen to either and have effectively doubled the memory!Videos look amazing!  I was a little disappointed at first .on the  Nook  side of the dual boot. with the audio as watching concert videos on YouTube. etc did not seem to go very loud. but the quality was quite good.  The earphone jack seemed a little loose at first and stereo did not seem to be working as it should to both earphones.  Come to find out. you have to really jam the plug in to the earphone jack pretty hard..I just didnt have them in all the way .this helped with the stereo issue above. but not the volume.  Also had issue with downloading from my Windows Media Player onto the Nook as some files would download and some would not.  Dual  booted to the  Android  .micro sd card. and WOW!!!  The volume. sound is absolutely AMAZING on YouTube. music files. etc....Everything.Still had issues downloading and playing all music files from Windows media player as .wma files simply would not download and play.  Ultimatley purchased  PowerAmp  music player for USD3.99 . you can get a free version for 2 week trial. and once again. WOW!!!wma files all play great from my Nook player. the sound quality is EXCELLENT.Reading is wonderful on this tablet as it should be.  Using the AFN card I have access to Amazon. Amazon mp3 store. Kindle books...anything and everything I could possibly need or want.  Have other stuff on the  Nook  side.No camera...no problem.  Im a little perplexed by other reviewers who get their Nook HD and take away from their rating because of the lack of a camera.  Do a little research people!  I knew about 10 minutes in to researching this tablet that it had NO CAMERA!  Not Bu0026Ns fault you dont do your DD.For twice the price this would be a good buy.  For the price we got on Black weekend i am absolutely thrilled!!  Dont miss out on this one if you want a great tablet at a decent price.,5,1,2265
A2MQ1VGYFZZ3KN,22,I bought this player to use at work. and I love it.  It works really well and hasnt broken or anything yet.  I only use it with the AC adapter so Im not sure about its battery life. and I dont use it in the car or  anything so Im not sure about skippage.  However. it is a good model and  I have been very satisfied with it.  If you just want a basic player for  not too much cash. and dont care about all the bells and whistles. go for  it.,4,1,441
A2MQ47BBL7F6B6,55,I used this mount for an LG 32 inch LCD so it only needed to hold 30lbs which it is doing no problem.  I am only able to screw in two of the four screws to the back. but it seems to work just fine.  I saw in the other reviews complaints about the bolts and the need to make sure you mount the unit level as it does not adjust to compensate in that manor.  I think they must have addressed these problems because the bolts provided are sturdy and the tv has some play to compensate for any mistakes in mounting.,5,1,510
A2MQ5UJK2ZNGLR,33,The picture quality isnt comparable to u0026quotregularu0026quot digital cameras. but then again  this isnt a regular camera! The Internet Viewcam is extremely small and very easy to handle .point and shoot.. Barely OK for taking simple still images .640 x 480. and OK for making small MPEG4 movies .max 320 x 240. that you can distribute over the Internet. Its really simple to transfer pictures and movies tofrom the camera via the included smartmedia floppy adapter. but the bundled software is crappy. The Internet Viewcam is more of a toy than anything else .because of the poor picture quality.. but I would recommend anyone to buy it as its the coolest hitech toy Ive seen in years.,4,1,689

A2MQWWKMBOKBR5,0,Works as advertised.  Good quality and was brand new.  I use it to Feral hunt and stay in contact with others in the field.  Its been in the rain. cold and hot weather.  Great product and I have no complaints.,5,1,209
A2MR1P7J1OV2DA,11,... which is be small. and receive radio signals. it does both of those things very well. if i get static while listening to an FM station. i flip the little cityrural switch. and most of the time. everything is better. the lock button is very handy. since it deactivates all buttons on the device to avoid accidental channel flipping or powering down. the small nub on the middle radio preset button is extremely helpful. since it allows me to find my favorite radio station if im fiddling around with the walkman in my pocket.the only setback. i did notice that it sucks batteries quicker than it should. other than that. i love it.,4,1,634
A2MTQQLVI5D28F,46,Ordered these for staff with laptops for security reasons.  I have not heard back from anyone on how they like them yet. but they look durable.,4,1,143
A2MU083UPQG2XU,2,Plug this into your Garmin and it will go into a loop rebooting.  After two hours with Garmin tech support and reinstalling software. I figured out it was the AC adpater. Plugged the Garmin into by Blackberry adapter and it works fine.,1,0,235
A2MUN65L8O3R5Y,1212,Use it with my Mac powerbook. My daughters high school often requires work handed in on a floppy. .!.. This does the trick. Just plugged it in and everything works without a hitch.,5,0,180
A2MW9BM6SEMIAZ,23,This dvd player can give more than you expect from a dvd player. A real adio and video rejoice and satisfaction. Perfect ultrahigh frequency response of DVDAudio with the video precision of progressivescan. You can feel the impressive quality of sound with the separate transformers for Digital u0026amp Analog. and serves you a luxury of four different digital output. A Cutting edge design. Never miss this one.I recomend this product to all HT fans.,5,1,452
A2MXVX3JKFCL3D,22,I have had this radar detector for six months. I purchased it after getting a USD300 ticket. I will say it has saved me a number of times. Its  radar detection is very good. I have never failed to be alerted to a cop  using radar. However. Its laser coverage is highly lacking .I just got a  ticket yesterday from a laser gun.. It has never alerted me to a laser  signal. despite the fact that I have driven by a number of officers using  laser guns. If the police in your area use laser. dont get this detector.  It doesnt work. However. if you want great radar detection this unit is  very good and inexpensive.,3,0,613
A2MY0PHV4B3WP2,66,I like the nook. I read a lot of books on it. I wish they had more apps. Internet works good. sometimes it freezes up on me. so I just turn it off then on again after a minute. Learned that trick from my phone.,4,1,210
A2MYRMQWSWGR29,0,I got this from a yard sale. The cords are unwieldy. The bass is too strong and is not adjustable. Stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers.,2,0,161
A2MYVF08FK0ZKQ,0,This HDMI cable is VERY low quality and not reliable.  After receiving this cable. i used it to connect my DSLR to a TV and noticed instantly the artifacts in the image caused by the cable.  Colour was messed up and the image was flickering.  The next time i tested it. it did not work at all.  My other namebrand HDMI cables do not have any issues.  The seller gave me a refund. but still. save you time and buy one from a known brand.,1,0,436
A2MZRCGX947V40,0,and then it moves erratically. or will only go sideways...drives me nuts. I will get the Expert Mouse trackball. Wish they had an optic one,1,0,139
A2MZSBCCDVR5QO,0,Bought it one day and received it in no time at all I bought this for my cell phone. The only regret I have is that I should have bought a bigger card. I carry alot of music and pictures on my phone but all in all it works just fine.,5,1,233
A2MZWE0KP6K6J9,0,These cables are flakey and cheap. Spend the money and buy a better grade cable The cable is not reliable and the plastic clips break easily.,1,0,141
A2N0NM8WN219SF,1,I liked the Nook Simple Touch that I purchased and the price was right. but I purchased this model by mistake. I thought it had the glow light and it didnt .my bad!.. The company took it back without a problem and charged me a minimal restocking fee. Thanks for understanding!,4,1,276
A2N1AGJEFZCZ9D,11,I thought this product was not going to work well in my house. however it turned out to work better than I expected. I have it hooked up to my modem on my laptop. I download web pages at about the same rate as before .long cord to the phone jack. at times even faster. It does disconnect once in a while but this is a small price to pay when it saves me from dealing with long phone cords. Was worth the gamble for me.,4,1,418
A2N1QLU57YCA7R,88,I chose this model because of the good reviews of it here on Amazon.com. I do not think so highly of this model as others.  There is a constant hissing sound that I could not ignore. The music was always louder out of one ear than the other. I only used the phones once and I was only two feet from the stereo. I could not stand them any longer.These faults may not bother some people as much as it does me. Even though I paid only USD11 for the set. Id rather crank up my stereo and bother the neighbors than try to listen to music with these things.,2,0,551
A2N1TL2MSMTY62,12,This item was pretty hard to find. I needed something basic and old school for my mom. She barely got a computer that gathers more dust than use. She was very happy with the gift. So it served its purpose well.,4,1,210
A2N2CYJ67CEEVP,11,I think it is a shame that someone should offer this for sale without mentioning that the Analog TV channels are all mandated to be shut down and only HD will be available in about 45 weeks. .Febuary 17th. 2009.The video card will work and some small TV stations will be allowed by the FCC to transmit. but anyone that purchases this should have the information that the TV portion will quit in 4 weeks.Cable analog will continue to work so you may use it as an unencrypted cable tuner if the tuner is compatible .most are..,1,0,524
A2N3OJ1T4IKZBM,0,Its not top of the line by any means. but certainly a good value for the price.,5,0,79
A2N3PEHL6QY8U8,12,I looked high and low from WalMart all the way tho Barnes u0026 Noble and could not find a charger for my daughter Nook. Thank god you guys was right on time!not only did you have it I bought a used one and it works just as well as a brand new one.1satisfiedcustomer,5,1,266
A2N3Y1Q86WU9T4,22,Nice and new. no issues thus far. great amount of storage havent figured out how to save to SD yet,4,0,98
A2N4UTW9XO2402,11,This Fisher system is stylish. works well enough. and is a satisfactory buy for the money.  Though it leaves the consumer desiring a little more power .meaning the clarity distorts at higher volume levels.. its plenty  bang for the buck.  No complaints here a worth system for your favorite  music. especially if it isnt played too loudly.,4,1,339
A2N56OFRYNSDD6,99,The Nook Simple Touch Ereader is a great tool. I use it often in all kinds of locations. Originally I was concerned when it did not connect to my wifi but I went on to Bu0026N and did their download and it worked fine after that. It is exactly what is it says it is. The screen quality is amazing. Some of the transissions are not efficient. but overall it is a nice reader.,4,1,374
A2N5NA88M5Y0ST,1,This looks great and all but where do I store my pen. Im looking for a folio that will also store a penstylus.,4,1,110
A2N5OCJLPK4ZWV,0,This is just a radio. big. black and ugly!  I wanted a great sound reception.  I cant get any a.m. reception and the f.m. is lousy compared to my USD10.00 sony alarm clock radio.  I paid 60.00 plus 13.00 Su0026H and will now have to pay that much to ship it back if the seller even agrees to reimburse the cost!  Totally disappointed and frustrated!  Such a hassle!  This product is a waste of time and money!!!,1,0,411
A2N5TA04VWM5NL,11,Ive been using an Allsop cassette cleaner like this one since around 1975. It is exactly as described in the product details. Its basically an empty cassette shell with three separate replaceable pads that move horizontally back and forth for 20 seconds over your capstons and your recordingplayback head. Most people dont bother to clean their decks on a regular basis. but if you do. youll see plenty of dirt build up on those pads. Do yourself a favor if you own a cassette deck of any kind and use this product after every 30 or 40 hours of usage. Stay away from other types of cassette cleaners that dry clean your deck. They are abrasive.,5,1,644
A2N68UON1EKDSB,6464,This product should be subject of a safety recall the prongs of the 360 degree rotatable plug came loose from the plastic base and remained embedded in the socket which while I was unplugging it momentarily shorted together. This *caused* a power surge between the computer and the monitor .plugged into another strip. destroying BOTH pieces of equipment. UL listing should be yanked. and Belkin should stand by their customer claims. Someone may .already even. die from this cheap plastic timebomb. Closer examination reveals the plastics on the base strip melting away. If you have one. turn off the breaker and remove it from service IMMEDIATELY.,1,0,649
A2N6QZ8YA8N1XN,0,I bought this radio. 3 years ago. they haventchanged it. This radio has survived.Thunderstorms. outside.camping. Very hot showers.....A two year old dropping it on the floor.Just last week . my 3 year old pulled the antenna wireoff.and it still picks up f.m. Wow.I am going to buy another one.I feel this radio is definately worth the money!!!Would make a nice gift for a radio person.,5,1,385
A2N7OGLN00U1KZ,1414,Does not fit in the unit access point for the plug. I even went so fer as to trim the plastic so as to be able to plug it all the way in..sstill could not make contact with the sight . to be able to make upgrades possible!,1,0,222
A2N8BXQ2BAYQNC,0,I had a VCR that had sat in my garage for at least ten years without being used.  When I tried to record something it was terrible.  This head cleaner material did a great job of cleaning the heads and now I get a great recording.,5,1,230
A2N8F3EW0CGISK,12,I found this to be a most beautiful keyboard But at this point it stops. A very quite keyboard to use and the styling and weight is extreamly well thought of.But that Infrared has got to go. And the mouse is borrowed from  the laptops which in my case is undesirable. If you are doing a lot of  networking you may want to leave your mouse on the desktop. If you are  doing much typing like word processing u0026amp spreadsheet work you may need  a box of batteries handy. I love its looks and style but it could be  upgraded in these areas.,4,1,540
A2N8JNXSX664YK,46,I was glad to find this drive to retrieve data from some old floppy disks from college. I first plugged it into my Lenovo Thinkpad and had mixed results. Under Windows. it would often recognize the first disk. but inserting subsequent disks. Windows would not refresh to show the contents of the new disks .even after unplugging and replugging the drive..Ive had much better luck on my MacBook Pro. I find that if I unplugreplug the drive between disks. Finder will refresh and show the contents of each disk. I wish the drive had a mechanism to automatically refresh Explorer  Finder when each disk is inserted. but this gets the job done.,4,1,640
A2N8TGT7UHGVR7,0,i wish i knew what it does. it seemed like a good deal so i bought it.,3,0,70
A2NA6139UJ3PEI,0,In less then a year after I bought this it already broke.  A simple tap to it and it will turn off and back on.  This makes it useless. if I am able to get it on at all. RIO provided no customer support. a bad and outdated product.,1,0,231
A2NBPR4M3MFKKI,0,Received it very fast and onlyn took me less than a hour to install. Just make sure you make sure its mounted to a stud.,4,1,120
A2NE1GWSMKGC3P,0,It is hard to beat the sound coming out of a unit this small . but the CD player has broken twice.  The first time. JVC told me it would be 150 to fix. almost what I paid originally for the stereo.  When I said it wasnt worth it and asked to have them send it back unfixed. they informed me that that would cost me 65 dollars to put it back together and ship it.  I wish they had told me that before they had me send it to them!  Well I wasnt going to pay for a broken stereo. so had them fix it. only to have the same thing .CD laser. go out one year later.Bad news.  I have other stereos and CD players much older that have never had problems.Radio and Aux input work fine though and the speakers sound amazing in a small room.,3,0,729
A2NECIVJ4NFH8U,1,Lets start with the bad first because ppl want to know the downside to this.*Not sure if its HD when using this cable because I compared it with my PC connecting it wirelessly to TV. The PC to TV wirelessly connected. looked better than this HDMI cable.*Once connected to Nikons HDMI port you will have limited selections. 2 choices only .I forgot the choices. I hardly use it.. *You can not use your camera and take picturesvideos while using the TV as the screen.*Nikon having a special sized HDMI port is stupidThe rest are good. Just read other ppls comments for more results,4,1,579
A2NFLS48R4I5XQ,0,This is my first FRS radio. but I am a ham radio operator and Ive owned a number of handheld radios. I used an ADI Dualbander as a comparison. I found the receive sensitivity better than my scanner or ADI. It has an  excellent front end. The audio output was also easy to understand. With  only 250mW audio output. you couldnt be in a very noisy environment.  however its adequite in most family situations. As for transmitting. I  checked field strength aginst my ADI set at 500mW output .the rated output  of the Midland.. and the Midland actually pumped a little more than my ADI  did. I conceede that this may have been due to my ham radio antenna not  having been designed to resonate at FRS frequencies .460 MHz FRS versus 445  MHz ham.. The frequency accuracy of my unit was very precise as well. It  was off by less than 100 Hz. Thats lower than the resolution of my  frequency counter.. much better tolerance than the specs in the book. The  transmit audio was a little muffled. but quite understandable. The squelch  opens up a little more around computers than I would like. and it would  have been nice to have an adjustable squelch. Yes the battery cover can  come off accidently. but no worse than most toys or portable radios. You  would have to work at it to get it to accidently come off. I would have  preferred an LCD readout. but for USD20 I consider it clearly the best buy  money can buy. Good job Amazon!,4,1,1427
A2NHL9CHNKT9QE,99,A bit more lightweight than the usual tape I buy but it works just fine and for the price it is great!,4,1,102
A2NICY8I08AZL2,0,For the price. and the brand name. Motorolas FRS radios should be more durable  these dont last long in average use .either business use by IT professionals. or the real torture test. with preteen boys..,3,0,203
A2NIFDKP54R09M,616,This is a great product and I cannot find one thing to complain about with Landware.  They even have good customer service. as my software download problem was solved in minutes with no waiting.  Its tough. light. tiny.  and easy to carry around.  You can type anywhere regardless of surface. on  your knees even.  Dont underestimate the advantage that it has no power  supply of its own. so no battery issues.  No observable extra battery drain  on your Palm V either.  This GoType solves the shift key problem I  mentioned in my GoType III review. and it improves the keystroke feel so  much that it feels like a regular keyboard to me.  The key layout is  slightly changed and improved too. over the III.  The serial port and  recharge function mean that the keyboard supplies you with a second synch  cradle too .although it does not come with the necessary AC adaptor. which  is not available separately as far as I can tellyou have to buy a travel  kit or a Palm VVx to get one.  Go figure..,5,1,997
A2NIFDKP54R09M,6061,The only reason my review was four star not five. is that the key stroke feel is a little better on the Palm V GoType. and because the right shift key is a little small and out of place so that you tend to hit an arrow key  when you reach for the shift key with your right pinky.  I have sort of  large hands and found this slightly reduced keyboard just fine for  touchtyping. even for extended periods.  Its tough. light. easy to throw  in a bag or side jacket pocket. or even back pocket if you dont sit down.  Youll always have your keyboard with you. its that easy and light.,4,1,580
A2NIOZZJJJMT66,1922,This handheld GPS is exceptional!  There are a few glitches. like clearing the odometer presenting as an option before clearing the trip odometer. The book is near worthless. but play around a while and it all becomes clear.I adapted it with velcro to act as a speedometer in my car. and as a cyclometer and navigational system on my bike.  It has a LARGE type display that helps in this regard. Use backlight very sparingly or when wired to the cigarette lighter. Plastic face scratches easily and is hard to read if you use polarized shades. My brother uses a sheet of adherent plastic to protect it.  Waterproof would be nice. considering that handheld navigation outdoors is its function.On the other hand something you can carry that always knows the time. lat. long. altitude and exact location of where you have been and distance and direction of any city in the world or anywhere else you want to go for 145 is pretty cool. For Muslims who travel. the city is u0026quotMakkahu0026quot.,5,1,993
A2NIT6BKW11XJQ,45,I  chose this item to go with my synthesizer.  It fits perfect and I can hear very clearly.  It appears to provide a surround sound.,4,1,132
A2NJATP8RXJP9W,11,These are inexpensive and work well with airline audio systems. computers. walkmans.  Battery life is excellent. at least 20 hours on a set of batteries.  However. mechanically. these headphones are flimsy.  The earcups twist for storage. but if stressed. they will break off.  They can be repaired. if you dont mind using epoxy glue and wrapping up the break with wire. and not having the twist capability anymore.,3,0,415
A2NKFXA4WA2OTJ,1213,I was given a Palm V for no reason .the person who gave it to me did not need it.. When I bought this charger. I knew it would great. The casing is nonplastic. which is good .my brothers casing is plastic. and even though is Palm is color. mine will stay durable for awhile.. Ive heard it only takes a few short moments to charge. and the battery lasts for about a month. The HotSync software is free. and there are lots of shareware and freeware apps for this Palm. not to mention the apps already included on the Palm.Reading your emails is very nice. especially when your flying out the door to school or work. and you do not have time to check your email. All you do is press the hotsync button. finish gettign ready. and there you go. Read your emails on the road and respond to them. Then hotsync your Palm when you get home to send your replies. Nice feature.Over all. any newer generation Palm model should do the trick for you. Palm makes great products. so go and get one today!,4,1,988
A2NKVRJKLESLSH,23,Installed the antenna on a Panasonic TV. Most channels worked better .except for Channel 2. for about 1 day however none of then could be adjusted as per the manual  I was happy then all channels got worse and worse and the machine is back in the box and rabbit ears back on top.Maybe the signal strength in my area is too high?? but I tried all options of highlow ears and physical orientations.Dont know if it is a defect in this particular one or just a big waste of time altogether.,2,0,486
A2NLRQBX9KQMRI,67,Ordered this because it was compact and I could use it outside my vehicle on the trail.  Went to use it for the first time this past Saturday and it would NOT transmit.  I could hear others. but could not speak to anyone.  I tried with both the antennae mounted to the vehicle and with the antennae that came with the radio.  I would not recommend this item.,1,0,358
A2NM4RYS7LM9RO,1,The cable is very good quality and was delivered quickly. The price was very reasonable and I would recommend anyone looking for such a cable to not fear buying it from this site.,4,1,179
A2NMEERFNBS4PX,0,As one of the inventors. of course I give it five stars. Im biased.Recoton Corp owned Discwasher and manufactured the product. Recoton has since gone bankrupt. The patents have expired. The solution was kept a secret and we supplied it in concentrated form to Recoton. The components had a shelf life. which has long since passed. and have been disposed of.When we licensed it to Discwasher we were told it would be made in the U.S. but the manufacture promptly went to China. We were aware of some quality problems but it was out or our control.Im delighted that people used and enjoyed our product. If you need cleaning solution Id suggest trying to make your own. Use a very dilute nonfoaming surfactant. any foaming or sudsing soap will create a mess. Good luck. it took us a while to get right.,5,1,799
A2NN43PRYW4LN2,22,I LOVE IT IT CAME WITH ALOT OF STUFF AD ALL OF IT WORKED THE BASS IS FOR ROCK MUSIC IT LOOKS GREAT AND YOU CAN SHAKE IT TILL YOU GET TIRED AND THE THING WONT SKIP I DROPED IT WHILE I ROAD MY BIKE AND IT STILL WORKS THE  AWIA SUCKS THE BIG ONE AWIA MAKES GREAT STERIOS NOT CD PLAYERS GET IT WHILE  YOU CAN THE ICE BLUE,5,1,317
A2NNVLM5HQZMYB,4151,For working around the house you cant go wrong with this radio.  Its cheap. works decent even if it isnt the greatest sound in the world.  I use it on the golf course to listen to baseball and working around the house.,4,1,218
A2NOW2207WOIH3,11,i plugged this into my genesis hoping that it would work for it.. unfortunately it doesnt fit! do not buy this item for sega genesis..,1,0,134
A2NQ5LLFYUKUFL,14,This mic works well. but its a bit awkward.  I got it because the webcam I was using didnt have a builtin microphone for my Yahoo Messenger and Skype live chats.  It was crisp and clear sounding. but Ive since upgraded my webcam and no longer need it so much.,4,1,259
A2NRDTI3Q9AK20,11,I was unable to use this at all. The software with it was Windows 98 and and I am running Vista. Totally incompatible and I dont know why you would have anything like it in your inventory. Probably wont shop Amazon again.,1,0,221
A2NRJ87CAME4W6,11,Bought this lock for college and so far it has worked perfectly. The steel cable loop is long enough for me to loop it around my desk and back through itself. The only thing I have to say is to make sure that your computer has a Kensington lock slot. 99%of all computers have it but just check before you buy.,5,1,309
A2NS5QQ1W5KX8U,0,Ive used and sold MANY types of binos. For CLARITY. weight. size. u0026amp price. these are REALLY good. Understand that their intended use is a wide field of view. such as sporting events.  not magnification.,4,1,209
A2NSS0L3NIU6CN,23,I am dissatisfied with bu0026n nook this product is only good at their site. and the choice of books and apps is poor compared to kindle,2,0,136
A2NTSJ8C9JAZCI,0,If youve ever needed an adapter to review your old VHSC tapes on a regular VCR. then this is the one !! When it arrived I put the supplied batteries into it and cranked it up. Worked perfectly. No worries. no hassles. no problems. I would like to tell everyone that this is one product that will work the 1st time. and every time after that. Great stuff !!,4,1,356
A2NU1TH2OO5U6N,23,Want a horror story? Check this... This past summer. I put in a bid on Diamonds eAuction for a refurb Rio SE and won .yeah. u0026quotwonu0026quot  right.. First they sent me a 32MB Rio by mistake. Then they sent me a Rio  SE  broken and filthy dirty .so much for being u0026quotrefurbishedu0026quot..  After that. they sent me a brand new Rio SE  the next day. the control  button falls off of it. Finally. they sent me another brand new unit  the  display doesnt work. Diamond will no longer respond to my emails and the  1800 number wont go through from my calling area. Also. with each unit  they sent me. I had to pay USD22 Cdn .GST  I live in Canada.  Id be able  to get it back from Canadian Customs but Diamond wont send me a letter to  confirm the RMAs I sent back to them. Still want to buy from Diamond...?,1,0,816
A2NU719R4DALL7,12,review says it all.  I have a Galaxy s3 and a galaxy s4.  neither one works on the S4 but 1 diddoes work on the S3.what gives?  I do not know but they basically are a waste of money.  I just purchased the google chromecast. I hope this works better!!!!,1,0,252
A2NUN3UYLJYKFN,0,This product was ultra cheap at USD3.18 however it didnt work. Apparently it is possible to spend too little. You get what you pay for! For USD8.50 I purchased a plug adapter and lighter adapter that works by allowing a standard USB cord to be plugged into either. The alternate vendors product worked well.,1,0,307
A2NUNA6O6GXXWJ,66,I own an ETX90 .original nonelectronic ver. and am delighted with the optical and mechanical design. Unfortunately. I remain a little concerned about Meades quality control as the secondary mirror fell off inside my scope when it was a few months old. and a friend says his secondary baffle  came loose. Still. if you dont get a flawed unit the optics are a terrific  value and the Super Plu0026oumlssl 26mm eyepiece included is very good. as  well.x,4,1,450
A2NVQWT3NWNKL0,0,The Cobra Micro Talk 2 performed well.  I was pleased to find out that it had a 1 12 mile range in town.  That is very good considering most only get 12 to 1 mile range.  It is a great all around radio and its  accessories are good.,5,1,232
A2NWSAGRHCP8N5,2121,It never worked. My daughter worked to earn the money to get this and it never worked for her. I had to buy her a new one to replace it,1,0,135
A2NWZNWXPQE3ON,11,I bought three of these cameras. so my family and I can stay in touch. I upgraded to XP. and was shocked when I went to install it. and it would not work. I was already to buy a new camera. when I by chance. looked at some of these reviews. Thanks to those who provided a link to the XP Driver. I really like this camera. and I am looking forward to using it on my XP machine.,4,1,376
A2NX4AQJZZRNCD,11,Please be aware that this antenna does not work within houses that have stucco walls! My house has stucco walls. therefore I had to return it. I  also tried it on a tv in another house wout stucco walls u0026amp it worked  quite well.,4,1,234
A2NXFRTVB2X23U,2935,These are easy to use. They do work on sticky substances with some elbow grease. I didnt feel like I was damaging the discs when I used these wipes. but sometimes I had to press harder than I was comfortable with to clean.,4,1,222
A2NYM3E877TUAA,0,I got this as a gift. and I must say. its one of the better gifts I have received.  Many people complain that it isnt u0026quotAluminumu0026quot. if you would take the time to go to Palms web site. and see that they tell you it is plastic. you would have known what to expect.  Its hard plastic. and  the anodized aluminum helps to add an extra layer of protection.The  spring holds it shut enough to keep it safe. but isnt a pain to open.  A  nice balance if you ask me.  As far as Hot Synch and charging. all of the  suggestions from previous people work fine. or just lay it on its side and  do it.The people who say it is cheap expect too much for the amount paid.  Plus. I  dont like leather .it comes from cows.. so this was my only option for a  case.  Aside from building your own case out of metal and styrofoam. buy  this to save your Palm V.,4,1,852
A2NZ7SJS5GD6GH,1315,First of all. Amazons customer service is fantastic.  This is the second one Ive owned.  The first one I wired into my Jeep. then sold the Jeep when I moved out of Utah.  I liked it so much. that when I moved BACK to Utah. I ordered another one.  When this radio arrived. the NOAA receiver didnt work.  So I notified Amazon. who immediately sent me a new one. which works flawlessly.  I returned the broken unit to Amazon. postage prepaid by Amazon.  Topnotch.The radio works as expected. and although the range is not as long with the short antenna as it is when it is tied to a FireStik.  No surprise there.  But when out fourwheeling or on multicar road trips. this is the way to go.  Beats the little walkietalkies because you have more channels and you can have several people talking instead of just two.  I highly recommend this. and highly recommend Amazon.com.  Thanks!,5,1,878
A2NZ9GWN4G6XKI,23,The FACH has been replaced by a newer model charger. the FACR. Will function with both FABP battery packs installed or removed from the FRS units.One note. the FACH comes with a car cord but the FACR doesnt.,2,0,207
A2O0FZO2SW534E,12,I was upset after only one week of receiving my Nook Color.  Not only did my screen go blank. but it got hot and wouldnt shut off at all. So. I returned it thinking it was just something odd about that one Nook.  I exchanged it for another. only to have the same thing happen less than one month after getting that one!  Im very disappointed in this product.  I no longer think it was something odd.  I think theres something wrong with the NOOK!,1,0,446
A2O0XJJCW1SH4A,37,I have had a few versions of the Nook EReader. I love this version of the ereader. It has become my go to as far as a portable readertablet. I am a fan of the Nook EReaders. I can do the same things on the Nook as I can on my laptop computer.,5,1,242
A2O18ORN6WFHD6,23,I recently recieved a Voodoo2 1000 PCI video card for a gift.  Obviously. Voodoo3s are a much better idea for the most part. but there are a couple of things which should be mentioned about the Voodoo2.  I have a Pentium II  300MHZ. and I was always dissapointed with my ATI Rage Pro graphics card.  I installed the Voodoo2 card. and I have to say that it has worked great  for me.  I have not had a single problem switching from 2D to 3D. or vice  versa.  It has made my computer run much better graphicly. and so if you  want a decent upgrade for a mere USD50 .after rebate.. then I would suggest  getting a Voodoo2.,4,1,618
A2O2TL86CHTZ7V,0,GOOD  DRY VCR CLEANER.  HAVE USED A WET VCR CLEANER BEFORE BUT I THINK THIS ONE WORKS BETTER ON MY VCR.  USE IT ABOUT ONCE A MONTH TO KEEP MY VCR IN GOOD RUNNING CONDITION.,4,1,172
A2O3M5GRLLU6J6,0,The product did not work even after I tried all the suggestions and called the manufacturers tel  for assistance. They advised the product would only work if the units were on the same circuit breaker which was not advertised and would have eliminated it for me immediately.I tried it anyway on the same circuit breaker and it still did not work. The outlet was very helpful with the return. but it arrived at their location on 11410 and utill I emailed them 12810. I had heard nothing. After my email. they responded immediately. and so did you about my return credit.,1,0,569
A2O401KRELFFTQ,11,As a professional Internet media designer. I will never recommend you to buy this speaker system.

A2O7FAXQPAST0M,0,This recorder is my second digital recorder and is twice as good as the previous one at half the price. This unit records exceptionally well in the shorter 33 minute mode. though I have to use headphones to understand the  90 minute mode. A 60 minute mode would have been a good compromise.The  voice activiation is so good that a series of comments when played back  sound like an uninterrupted sentence. In the high sensitivity mode I can  record someone talking in a quiet room from over 12 feet away.  It is so  small that one can put it in a shirt pocket and record a coversation. The  unit does not have a carrying case. so I use a knife sheath that attaches  to my belt. This way I always have it when needed.  The V90 has the ability  to record a message with a playback alarm that goes off at a certain time  of the day. It cannot record a bunch of messages with varying playback  times. That would be a useful feature. Expect to see the price of these  units drop as technology improves. As far as improvements. I would like to  see a unit that records on command such as u0026quotV90..recordu0026quot and it  would say u0026quotRecordingu0026quot and then you would record until you say  u0026quotend recordingu0026quot. Then you could also command it to u0026quotset  playback for May 21 at 10 PMu0026quotMaybe someday.,4,1,1331
A2O7SS503E5FJP,7576,The Rio Diamond 500 is an excellent MP3 player.  Its small. light. looks sharp. and the buttons are easily accessible.It does have a few drawbacks. however.The software that comes with it is not exactly user  friendly.  The software wants to scan your entire harddrive for mp3 files.  when it does. it finds all kinds of mp3 files that you would never consider  putting on your Rio.  In my case. it found well over 400 short mp3 files  within my Age of Empires directory.  It took me forever purging them from  the database.  There doesnt seem to be a way of telling the software to  *only* look for mp3 files in a certain folder.Also. loading mp3 files  into your Rios memory should be much easier.  Whats wrong with just  dragging and dropping from any directory  even out of Windows Explorer?  But no .......The documentation that comes with the player is poor.  Good luck trying to figure out how to use the bookmark feature.But. Im  just being picky.  Im satisfied with the product and it does everything I  need it to do.,4,1,1027
A2O8C1FFH46Q6T,33,it works well but it does not sound good with the bass on and also when you turn it up and head phones are trash so go out and buy some nice ones but most head phones are trash it looks really cool but if a lot of dumb losers on your bus hit it a lot it will not work well but shocks are good enough for the bus and jogging and fits well in your pocket but with shocks on u go through a lot of battteries is spenend like USD20 on batteries a month but for the money it is pretty good but i wanna give it 3 and 12 starss,3,0,519
A2O8FIJR9EBU56,13,Well as one of the first to get this I figured Id give a review. The screen is great. Its pretty clear and seems tough enough not to need a screen protector. The plastic that was on the screen outofthebox left glue residue which was a pain to remove. It comes with a stylus that works great but navigating around with your finger is easy and works just fine. I usually just have to tap it with the back of my finger. When you get it. charge it for a few hours before you use it at all. Im not sure if my over sized good laptop even was charging it. So use the wall outlet. It comes with nice cables for both wall outlet and 12 volt. as well as a good usb cable. The supplied mount is excellent and easy to use. No tools required. The screen part snaps into another flat part on the mount and you have to make sure its clicked in all the way or it will drop out.. AFTER IT IS FULLY CHARGED. plug it in the pc and get your first free lifetime update. The software loads fine and tries to start up each time you use the computer. I stopped that and made a shortcut to start it myself. There are no options I saw to disable it from auto starting... I used ccleanertoolsstartup to disable it. The program DOES use a lot of resources when running. but you only need to update once in a while.My first drive with it was Tampa to El Paso. It saves my height. width. weight and hazmat class. I was hauling hazmat. It gave a killer route that would have saved time but I had to alter it for the company fuel stops and routes. It tells you everything you need to know. Where travel centers are and what they have. scales and weigh stations and much more which can all be symbols on the map if you wish. YAY now i dont have to buy an iphone. Some stuff in the manual says parts are for future use so Im guessing the updates are going to give even more. You can manually adjust the zoom. The automatic screen zooming works great. One time it was dark and cloudy with a cool looking sky and I looked at my screen and saw the exact same thing as I approached a ramp. You can save all your addresses and stops and put notes in them for phone numbers and gate codes etc. Then make groups .folders. for your addresses so you can find them even quicker. I sat there for 9 hours like a jerk and typed in all the company terminals and drop yards. It was fun. Im saving each new stop now with notes too.Once the GPS kinda got confused and mixed up my current rout with a completed one. It may have been my fault but I dont think so. I just restarted it real quick and it worked fine again.I also used it in my car. Its easy to switch between truck and car mode. I drive a medium large car and the 7 inch unit was a bit to big and did obstruct my view a little.The voice is fine and easy to adjust. The thing is nice and it works good. The traffic and road updates for life. I dont have to use internet or buy a netbook .with gps. and software... Im happy I got it. I dont get lost anymore.I like the TND 700. Id just like to tell Rand Mcnally that since we spent as much on this as for a laptop. please make this the best and keep updates and innovations coming to us for the next few years at least. Im kinda expecting you to make the software on the unit and on the TND DOCK .pc software. a bit better. Id also like to be able to set up routes INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to INTERSTATE to FINAL in order to comply with company route solutions. Sometimes we cant take all those better routes the unit suggests. You can make this worthy of five stars with just a little more effort.  Well. I gotta haul AUSDUSD. Joe,4,1,3590
A2O8VPEZPNKEX7,6767,I purchased this item for my SUV. I installed it exactly as instructed to do so on the instruction page. I had it tuned by the guy at the local truck stop  CB shop. He didnt much care for this type of antennas either.This is the WORST CB antenna I have EVER bought!The range is minimal.The sound is subpar.The antenna whistles in the wind and is very distracting and annoying!My recommendation ... BY SOMETHING ELSE!Sincerely.Totally Displeased,1,0,444

A2OACLZ170NLTI,0,I have battery problems .No way I am getting a month long charge.. and skipping ahead problems.I am able to use this reader to read epub library books. but the process is convoluted and way more difficult that using a Kindle to read library books.  The controls stink. if you use the touch screen. the reader skips ahead intermittently. If you use the hardware controls. it doesnt seem to skip ahead. but the controls are difficult to work .Kindle controls are way smoother..Also have the problem it wont take B u0026 N gift cards without a credit card.Also does not come with wall plug charger.B u0026 N customer service polite but unhelpful.Dont but this stinky readerspend the extra money and buy a Kindle.,1,0,709
A2OAJ99HPS26TN,0,This product works just as described in the description.  It is indeed a null cable replacement.  I did have one adapter come defective from the factory. but bargain cable is sending me out a replacement at no cost to me.,4,1,221
A2OAMKJBKR0PS5,0,We have three of these cameras here at work and they are great for the field but most of the users say that they are too limiting.  I found this  not entirely true.  After reading the manual that came with the camera. I  found that you can use one of five special effect settings.  While this is  nice. the main point is that you can also chose exposure settings.  I set  it for action photo and took pictures of my nephews playing basketball.  Not a blurry picture among them.  What was really great was that I gave  each one a copy of the pictures right on the spot by bringing some old  floppies with me.  The nephews made wallpaper out of them for their PCs  and they and their friends think its great.  While my other friends may  have more expensive cameras. they cant share the pictures right on the  spot.  Great for reunions when you only see friends and families once in a  while.  Instead of promising to email or snail mail pictures. just hand  them a copied disk. Oh. yeah. you can also take a picture of yourself with  the timer feature.  Special Note. As soon as I got the camera out of the  box. I taped a clear piece of plastic over the LCD view screen to protect  it.  I read a previous review which said how easily scratched it can get  and seeing our other cameras here at work. I was not taking any chances.  Guess what? Looks ugly but protects well.  Thanks for the info from the  previous review.,5,1,1419
A2OBJI4HDTFVDB,4445,Bought this antenna from a local best buy hoping to avoid cable. I have Recton rabit ears already. but was hoping for better reception with the amplified antennas. My reception got slightly worse. No matter what position the I put it in I couldt get the static to clear up. It never got better than my cheap rabbit ears. I took it back and tried an even more expensive one. Jensen tv930. it also dosnt work. Since some people seeem to like these amplified antennas. just buy it from a retailer with a good return policy.,1,0,520
A2OBRZDW3U3KJD,66,I bought this because of all the glowing reviews which really baffle me now.Reception is horrible. Tuning a station I wanted meant turning the radio ever so slightly. propping it with a wash cloth. moving the antennae and then stepping back 10 feet. If I touched it. the reception gets scrambled and I had to start over again. It was worse than the USD10 radio I was trying to replace which didnt even have an external antennae to deal with.The key word in the product description that I missed is water RESISTANT. not water PROOF. The battery compartment was in no way sealed to prevent water leaking in. just a standard battery door you find on your remote control. Im sure had I kept it. water would have leaked in quickly and corroded the thing.Lastly. even though it has a strap to hang it. its meant for a counter top. Hanging it means the controls are out of sight and difficult to use. This thing should not be kept in the shower. keep it next to the sink.,1,0,964
A2OC1UK7VMBLOT,34,Apparently these chargers. for Nook HDs. are not the kind of things that you can just look for the cheapest one. Something to do with needing a lot of power to charge them.The first knock off charger that I bought didnt work. you have to get the Barnes and Noble brand. and amazon has the best price that I could find.So if you have a nook HD. this is the charger that you want.,4,1,378
A2OCFY81BELYVJ,22,This makes it much easier to plug and unplug USB devices.  Also allows me to play on my device while it remains plugged in. I measured it to be sure and it is 6 feet and an inch  so they did not short me on the length at all.  I recommend this quality product.,4,1,260
A2OCRZ8PMH11K,0,I purchased these speakers for computer use. but the sound quality. and depth coupled with power output led me to use them with portable cdmd players in my office.  The sound is awesome!,5,0,186
A2OFNVX36WM59C,1919,I bought one as is on Ebay. As a handy guy I thought I might be able to fix it. The problem turned out a worm gear shaft froze up. This caused the stripping of cheap plastic gears inside. I was NOT impressed by its drive train. Very weak in my opinion. Google it to see others problems.,1,0,286
A2OFRLYVZNXFKW,213,It is really probably just my fault for not researching this item earlier. This camera was suppose to be a present for my son. when I got the package I opened it to check it out and it had a slot for a Floppy Disk! ?? So this camera is alot older than I thought and so many different buttons that it didnt look very user friendly for my 8 yr old. Needless to say I didnt give it to my son for Christmas,1,0,402

A2OGRLHZZWF411,0,After buying a couple that didnt match up to the screw holes on the back. I decided to take my search to Amazon.  After searching for my tv. I found this one.  I found it especially useful that Amazon had a picture on the website with the measurements between the screw holes.  I could easily measure the holes in the back of my tv. before I even bought it.  Installation was very simple with easy to follow instructions.  Ive had it up for 2 weeks now. and its peforming flawlessly.,5,1,483
A2OGXHE7PVLTOE,0,Dont have anything to really complain about.  EXCEPT there doesnt seem to be a way. or im missing it to tilt the TV up or down .ie. mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair..  and i am quite savvy with toolsassemblyetc. And it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the TV to adjust the angle.  No reason to not buy it though.,4,1,359
A2OH11RXZJDOEV,0,Looking just at the features. this is a good unit to get for a basic. portable AMFMSW receiver.  It has a good digital tuner. decent reception. an external antenna option for pulling in weak signals. etc.  However the design of the unit has several short comings.The biggest by far is that it uses up the batteries when turned off!  Leave it on the shelf. and in a few weeks itll be dead.  To add insult to the injury. all the features that require memory .channels. alarms. are lost when the batteries die.The second is the construction is not very sturdy.  The grill popped off of mine after a few months of regularly toting it around.  And the telescoping antenna  like all  is a failure waiting to happen .and it did..Im looking for a unit that has comparable features. but is more sturdy. has better power management. and nonvolatile memory.,2,0,846

A2OIBUMT560XQL,12,The battery on the unit I received only lasted 2 to five minutes. I liked the motion detection option but with such a short life it makes it useless. The camera cannot operate when power is plugged in. Video quality was good and the night vision is a nice touch.,2,0,262

A2OJXQZMK8QY3T,23,I am somewhat perplexed by the comments about battery life on the C2000C2020 series. I am using the recommended NiMH batteries in my C2020. Just today I shot 79 1600 x 1200 images including about 20 using  flash. I used the color LCD display for all composition. No only did I  never get a low battery indication but this shooting session used so little  power that the batteries recharged in only 20 minutes.I have a friend  with a C2000Z and he can EASILY fill his 32MB and his 8MB SmartCards with  images without getting a low battery indication.I think the secret has  to be the NiMH batteries. My friend with the C2000 has tried both  rechargables .NiCAD. and conventional alkalines and confirms that his  camera does indeed u0026quoteatu0026quot these battery types.,5,1,772
A2OK2E41LDZ8C2,1618,would be nice if it came with an antenna ...  spouse is having fun playing wiht it.. i put the batteries in and havent seen it since. mainly bought for camping trips and the weather  channels were the selling point.  were stuck once in an area without cellphone coverage.. dont have to worry about that again,4,1,308
A2OKCS5234ZV7S,12,First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook. played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out. So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched youtube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it. but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook. made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it. but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook. I can lend books to other. I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad. It fits in my computer bag. purse. which makes it so easy to take with me. It has my favorite games. Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have. but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around. the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook. and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family. as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook. I dont have to be tied to one book store like Itunes. Ibook. are the Kindle store... I dont like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said. When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie. It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that. I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth. and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said. I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook. I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook. as I can not put it down!What a great gift. and a great buy!!!,5,1,3319

A2OMFF9EAJ7KY9,0,After owning the FS7000 for a couple of months. here are my conclusions that I hope will aid in your purchasing decision.CONS. 1. Unit gets VERY hot.  2. Luminescent clock is annoying in that it does not  u0026quotrememberu0026quot the last display option that you selected. Also. I do  not like the orangecoloured display. Mine cannot be changed. 3. CD drive  is a bit loud  4. Remotes infrared beam range and range angle is not that  great. I literally have to stand in front of the 7000 to make it work via  remote. Off to the side? Forget about it. Maybe mines defective. Brand new  batteries make no difference 5. The unit is quite long. Dimensionally  speaking. the width and height is tiny but the length. I had problems in my  cabinet with all my cables attached. Most likely not a big deal for most.  6. Only one CDPROS. 1. Very good sound qualityclarity. Very crisp mids  and highs. but does lack lowend punch. Recently purchased a subwoofer to  compliment the bass. and it makes an incredible difference. Dont be fooled  by the FS8000. because for the difference in price between a 7000 and 8000.  you can buy a better quality sub than one that is provided with the 8000. I  would definately recommend a subwoofer to u0026quotcompleteu0026quot the sound.  2. Aesthetically pleasing. units champagne colour .cherrywood speakers  and glass lid look more expensive than it really is 3. Coolness factor.  Lets face it. as with PRO 2. it looks really cool 4. Separate BASSTREBLE  controls 5. SUB output 6. No builtin cassette deck.  7. Digitaloptical  out provides expandibility for MD 8. Reasonable priceIn conclusion. I  would recommend the FS7000 for anyone looking for a smalldesktopexecutive  system with above average sound quality. People wanting to buy this unit  must first consider what the intended use is and also where. Do not expect  the unit to completely fill a large space but for small to midsize rooms.  it is fine. Dont forget to try it with a sub...you will truly be  impressed. I was.,4,1,2012
A2OMVGNP2F5O6T,1515,Amazons review still touts this as a u0026quottop of the lineu0026quot camera when Nikon released the third generation CoolPix 990 months ago. The 990  fixes all the complaints people had with the 900 and the 950 .shown here..  It also ups the resolution to 2K x1500 .3.34 Megapixels.. Its a fantastic  camera.That much said the 990 is more expensive. and if you dont need  the extra resolution the 950 remains a great choice at a lower price. I  just take exception to Amazon presenting it as u0026quottop of the  line.u0026quotThe swiveling body on the 900. 950. and 990 allows you to  hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down. or at your knees  with the lens looking up. and still be able to see your composition on the  LCD display. because the LCD is on the other half of the body from the  lens. You just twist to see the LCD regardless of where the lens is  pointing. Other digital cameras dont do this and its really useful. Its  made possible by the fact that these cameras .especially the 990. are so  good at autofocus. autoexposure. and autowhite balance that for very many  scenes you can use the LCD to compose and frame the shot. not worry about  anything else. and get a great result.,4,1,1217
A2OMVQGC33VSNC,4243,I purchased the GPS 315 in December after using another brand for five years. The GPS315 represents a big improvement with better. quicker satelite acquistion. a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user  to use the sun or moon to  correct bearing. This way the user is not having  to pull out a compass to check bearing. Additional pluses are its small  size and light weight using only two AA batteries lasting up to 15 hours.  If weight is a concern. that is big. My previous unit used four and lasted  five hours. Problems. The manual is as sorry as it can get. It barely  covers TrackRoute. Track History. Backtrack. and Reverse Route. These are  major important features left to the user to figure out. I have yet to  figure them out consistently. With Track History there seems to be an  ability to set a scale. but what scale? Nothing tells me. Is it how often  it records a waypoint in history?I have emailed the company with  questions twice. called once .had to leave a voice mail because they were  not taking calls.. faxed once. Heard nothing from their customer  noservice. I wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts. Oh yes. my GPS  315 crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old.  Glad I wasnt in the middle of 40.000 acres. You cant zoom in on a  waypoint if it is very far away from your current location. Actually to do  so but you have to set a scale of .1 or .2 and Pan u0026amp Scan to it. If is  is 50 miles away. you can imagine how long that could take.,3,0,1519
A2OOWE2UA1DFY1,1211,Product does not function.I packed my .original. charger away in storage and was too lazy to find it so I bought this knockoff because going through Kodaks non English speak customer service was becoming too painful.  I thought about doing something about the USD20 I blew on this junk but decided against it because it was my laziness that lead me to buy it.  I decided to make it a life lesson. dont be lazy because it will cost you in the end.Again. product does not function.  It will NOT charge your camera and it will NOT transfer data from camera to computer.  The only reason to buy this product is if you are one of those people who have more money than brains and wish to make companies rich on your stupidity.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,1,0,746
A2OP4JIQ9T74CM,0,This offers me the protection I need in a small form factor.  I recommend it for mobile professionals.,4,0,102
A2OPFKDHSH8T31,11,I gave these tapes an OK rating because they were OK for recording only one time on them but if you had to rerecord on them they were no good and unfortunately I found this out the hard way. I would only recommend  these tapes to someone who is only going to use them one time.,3,0,277
A2OPLXUM32ZHJ,0,I got this player half year ago. and actually have been using it for 3 months. I applauded for its oustanding pricefeature ratio until recently it broke down. Its mechanical moving part. including laser head and CD  spinner. frequently locked itself. generating huge u0026quotclicku0026quot sound.  If its lucky starting playing a CD. everything is okay. But when it moves  from one CD to another. in random or sequencial order. the moving part gets  stuck forever. Yes. I bought it at a very sweet price. as long as it still  worked. To me. the moving mechanism inside is kinda fragile.,2,0,587
A2OQ9JH8X8LUM7,2526,There are only basic regulations. screen brightness + buttons and audio volume control.But the attractive price and good picture quality can make up for the lack of OSD and only one video input.This monitor doesnt have a scaler. but you can connect it to one computer only and scaling from lower resolutions is not a problem for current GPUs. And it displays text and graphics in VGA modes in full screen .i.e. BIOS startup screen and menus..My monitor has one hot green subpixel and no dead dark .sub.pixels. but Im still very satisfied with this purchase.,4,1,557
A2ORD5SERY2BQB,0,I am disappointed with this wireless speaker because it just doesnt get loud enough. The average boom box can get much louder than this. It sounds fine at a low volume but when it is turned up the bass distorts and the housing hums and rattles. I returned the first one I received because it sounded awful. the second one is a little better. not much though.It would be OK to use this speaker indoors but outside it is useless unless you are within ten feet of it.Another disadvantage is that you have to manually tune it. Even a cheap cordless phone can automatically lock into the signal.There is foam rubber insulation inside the housing that may be pressed against the woofer cone. I had to open mine up and push it out of the way.,1,0,735

A2OS4H2KWXVZTJ,23,One word to descirbe the Rio. WEAK. It is a FEEBLE GOOSE!  I was really excited when i got my Rio for Xmas. but then I wsa horrified! I opened up the box and picked up the Rio. i tried to open the battery compartment but the whole machine snapped in my hands!  IT WAS SUCH A FEEBLE GOOSE!  I had  only opened the battery compartment and it was already snapped up good!  I  tried to return the beast but. low and behold. the bloomin monkies refused  to give me a refund .not Amazon..My friend Johnny has a Rio as  well and the sound quality was extremely poor and no way near Cd quality! I  warn U know this little beast should be avoidedp.s REMEMBER IT IS A  FEEBLE GOOSE,1,0,671
A2OT17HDAAHE3W,516,purchased with screen protector and a spare charger. I was charged for 2for1 specials and received one of everything.  Advertised the ability to add applications from other than Bu0026N. first automatic update disables this.  Might not be so bad if their walled garden economic model was viable but the product was rushed out before the garden was planted.  It is impossible to sort choices by avg customer rating so you have to wade through it all which is thankfully meager.  There is supposedly an advantage in that you can visit any Bu0026N brick and mortar store and the staff will gladly help you. they are cheerful but in the end not very helpful.  After suffering through a common problem of the micro SD card getting stuck after two weeks of minimal use I asked to exchange it and was told to send it in at my expense and that it would take a minimum of 34 weeks.  There are no advantages to purchasing from one of their stores. the removeable storage that distinguishes it from others is a problem and with customer service like this they should be out of business soon.  It is a shame because the hardware does have potential. huge gaps between potential and promises. promises made and delivered.  Business majors will shortly be studying this as an example of how not to introduce a product.,1,0,1304

A2OU6GWWD21VRP,80,This radio has many options that I like such as going from portable to hand held.  My on complaint is that as a hand held. the range of transmit is very short.So if you plan to use it to move from the Jeep to the car or ATV. then it is a great package.,4,1,252
A2OU78Z5CHEQLW,0,The only thing that keeps this device from being perfect is the fact that its too small to be just a tablet and too heavy to be just an ereader.  But its an excellent tablet for the size and an outstanding ereader for the weight.  I wish Bu0026N would supply a broader choice of apps. but when you do get one it works .unlike some other tablets Ive used  are you listening. CRUZ?..  The builtin browser and email work like you would expect them to. and if youre using Outlook on your PC the email configures itself!  It only comes with 1GB built in so youll have to get a memory card if you plan to keep hundreds of books.  It also plays videos and music. and stores and displays photos.  The touch functions are a bit uneven but once you learn .quickly. that a light touch is usually best youll sail through them.  Screen resolution is excellent. its easy to learn. very functional  just a pleasure to own and use.  Ive called customer service once. and while theyre in India theyre very knowledgeable and helped me with several questions without a misstep.,4,1,1058
A2OUI0T52PTL,22,I am ashamed to admit it. but I actually bought two of these. My first one suffered a small drop onto carpet. after which the LCD display. then the entire player quit working. Although I thought that this was supposed to be a very rugged player. I felt that perhaps that was too much of a jolt. even for this player. Assuming that the mistake was mine. I bought another one. The new one was never dropped. never jostled. I even kept it unnecessarily dry. However. after only a few months... same story. LCD display goes first. then the entire player.This is what happens. One day. you put in a CD. it will not read it for about 15 seconds. Once it finally recognizes the CD. you push play. It begins to play. then pauses. You cannot unpause. so you try to skip a track. This does not work either. You look at the LCD display to see what track you are on. and you see this.  |._...... what is THAT? All of a sudden. you see the track number. then. with out you touching anything. the volume turns itsself ALL THE WAY UP AS LOUD AS IT WILL GO!!! You frantically try to turn it down. but the buttons have quit working. Eventually. you are able to turn down the volume .without knowing where it is set to because the LCD is now dead again.. but the volume keeps going lower and lower even after your fingers are no longer on the player. Now you can hear nothing. If this all began when you had the buttonlock feature on. you are locked out from adjusting anything at all until it is unlocked. If the buttons are not registering any input. that may never happen.Both of my players followed this same exact pattern. LCD display stops working. buttons become quirky. buttons act of their own free will. CDs are no longer recognized by player. player becomes a beecolored paperweight.Sony has made some wonderful products. but this is not one of them. The amount of energy that went into making this a durable player that could withstand anything from the outside was not enough to prevent any glitches would arise from the inside.I wish that some of the other highend CD walkmans that Sony makes would feature some of the weatherproofing and locking case features that this model has. but I can do without them if it means owning a CD walkman that does what it should do. that is. play CDs.PROS. Very weatherresistant. buttonlock .so that you cant accidentally skip a track by touching a button.. sturdy casing.CONS. Poor workmanship on inner electronics. poor quality headphones do more to detract from bass features than otherwise. Some gliches are acceptable with any product. as perfection is so hard to attain. but the failures that this player went through could have damaged my hearing. and temporarliy destroyed my sanity.SYNOPSIS. If this were a car. it would have been recalled. If it were a shipment of Aspirin. there would be a news alert about it.,1,0,2853
A2OUI2UFLX9NSO,1920,I could not be happier with this product. I had it installed in about 20 minutes and it worked great without any initial problems. Consistently get speeds of 49333 or better.Would highly recommend this modem.,5,1,208

A2OZK9CN1EGAO2,0,An Mp3 player can only hold a few hours of music at the most.But this minidisk player with the right adapter can hold unlimited Mp3 music with great sound.The Optical Digital Input included in this has unbelievable  sound.Better than CD sound.The analog has ok sound.It takes a little time  to write the name of the songs in this because this Minidisk player does  not have a JogDial in it.Other than that this Minidisk player is  great.P.S.  It also has rechargeable batteries included in it.,4,1,493
A2OZLHWLJ7H02M,89,Ive been using this modem for the last 3 months. and I thinkits great!

Theres no way to reset it either without going offline. Other then that its a great deal. which will upgrade your overall download speed.  END,4,1,368
A2OZQ1BF45ACIL,55,We live in the country so no interference excuse from neighbours.Wireless phones are in 4.7 gig band and computer wireless net in 2.4 gig band.

If you go on a camping trip of a few days. take a paper book!!! Ive order a new bigger battery well see if I can actual get the new battery in without breaking the reader .you have to take the reader a part to change the battery. see YouTube..

A2P38D8T3HQ14T,0,I have this attached to a 2 Firestik on my Jeep and it seems to work just fine for our trail runs where were within a mile of one another. I really dont use CBs for anything more  like longdistance chatter with truckers and whatnot. Its got some cool features. but honestly. I havent used them. Either way. this thing is good for what I use it for. Plus. when camping. we can go mobile with it. 104 good buddy.,4,1,410

All the features are ok.  The sound could be louder  for those noisy places like the lunch room or in the car or outside.  But  the price is good for what u bought it for.,3,0,345
A2P4VMUUX5YNM8,1518,I bought this for my dad. He loves it and uses it on his Harley motorcycle while riding. He did get a longer antenna though. because the short one does not pick up a lot. With this and a longer antenna you should be good to go. He also tested it in the car. so it is good for all types of vehicles. If you ride with other motorcycle guys who have CB Radios. this is a great investment.,5,1,385
A2P50XSO1AN0ND,22,I know nobody uses cassette tapes any more. so I was greatful to find these.  I know its a little backwards. but I make tapes off of the CDs our church sends out to people who request them.  I copy the sermon onto tapes for some men in prison here in Arizona and was relieved to find I could still purchase them at a decent price.,4,1,330
A2P59CAUAHOH2Q,11,The EigerMan F20v is an EXCELLENT Mp3 Player. The bass boost is outstanding. and the sound quality is excellent. I received mine about a week ago. and I was worried after reading all the bad reveiws that it might not work. It did work. It worked GREAT.The reason these people are writing such bad reveiws is because they did not look at the requirements before they bought it. Before you buy anything similar to this. make sure to check the requirements. For the F20v. DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS.  Your parallel port supports ECP mode .the f20 works ONLY on ECP mode.. you have Windows 95. or 98 and your Parallel port can work on a 0378 IO address.The only problem I had with the EigerMan F20 was the headphones. the headphones that come with it are trash. If you want to have good quality sound. get another pair of phones. the earbuds that come with it sound tinny. and the bass boost does little on them. The carrying case is really nice. but theres no holes for the battery. parallel port. or smartmedia slots.The 32 megabytes that come with the player are good for a while. but I would recommend buying a few more cards if you plan on having a lot of music. With the ability to swap smartmedia cards. you can make mixes on different cards and change them depending on what you feel like.All in all. if the eigerman will work on your computer. I definately recommend buying it. It is a great player. and I think you will enjoy it very much.,5,1,1439

A2P7V1H74DQ2WA,0,Before you buy this. notice that although its deceptively called u0026quot36  capacity cassette tape caseu0026quot it actually only holds 30 boxed tapes!  It will hold 36 cassette singles. which .obviously. you dont own. or 36  tapes removed from their boxes. which you also arent going to do. because  if you did. youd have no way of knowing which tape was which without  pulling them all out!  So go ahead and buy this carrying case if you want.  its a perfectly fine case. but it aint gonna hold 36 tapes!,2,0,508

A2P9G6NRKVOU5Q,11,I was a little hesitant about getting this because I purchased a new Kindle 3 and saw this wasnt made to fit those.  After reading another users review stating the Kindle fit. I took the plunge.  Im happy to say my new Kindle 3 fits well.  At first. it seems like it isnt secure enough. but the microsuede and the elastic keep it firmly in place.  Ill be sure to upgrade to a cover that fits once Moleskine releases those. That said. the cover is beautifuly made. like all of Moleskines other notebooks. and the two pads for inside add a nice touch for those who like to doodle while they read. Some say that this cover is geared toward lefties. but as a righthanded person. I like my book on the right side  so this fits fine with me.,4,1,735
A2P9KNX5JRKPKH,55,On the first try the outdoor speaker played for 30 seconds then stopped working. I returned to Amazon .no charge. and got a replacement speaker. Opps. same thing. the speaker played nicely for 30 seconds and then went dead .the speaker sounded good for the brief time that it played.. I emailed Amazon.com and wanted to role the dice and give it a 3rd try. Amazon responded by saying that the problem with the speaker was more widespread than originally thought and they would not be able to send me an additional one. They refunded all my money also gave me a USD10 credit in my account for the hassle. I was surprised to see the same speaker still for sale on their site two weeks later especially if there is a manunfacturing defect. the speaker goes dead and they know about the issue. Should I give the speaker another try? I really did like the product if it would only work. Ive searched the customer reviews and this problem is NOT isolated to me.  Well. if you order this product save the box and packaging as you might very well be returning it after 30 seconds. It seemed like a solid product but at the low price of USD32.00. Im not surprised it failed to work. Please leave feedback as I would like to order anothrer myself. but the hastle of returning defective products is a pain no matter how easy Amazon tries to make it.  Also. I wanted to mention that it was very generous of Amazon to give me a USD10 credit for my troubles with the speaker... Amazon.com is a very reputable company I recommend them strongly and I will continue to buy many prodcuts from them now and in the future.  Best of luck with this one.,1,0,1631
A2PB7BQ593O20V,22,I got this when I was driving a truck across country. but I was working for a jumpseat operation and was never in the same truck twice. I was looking for one I could easily take with me to the next truck. but this thing is simply underpowered. I still have not been able to get it to talk out more than a truck length. and the whole reason I needed it was for communicating  with the dispatch office at warehouses to know when to get my paperwork.I will give it this much though. when it does work it sounds very clear. and it is extremely mobile. Its just not very long range.,2,0,577

A2PFK5F6T1XKZW,0,With a low budget to start with. I wanted a reliable DVD player that would also play my CDs.  I researched several on line and in stores and finally decided upon the RCA5220P model ....  Not owning any DVD discs. I rented several from Blockbuster Video and much to my dissapointment. the discs were not compatible.  My Staurday night was very much a no go because of this.  However. RCA hotline walked me through the process of resetting the unit which corrected the problem.  I was excited the start to watch my movies only to find out that each movie I put in. every so often. the picture would freeze.  When it returned. it would skip over several scenes.  This totally annoyed me but again RCA sent me a disc cleaner. it seems to be working but should further problems continue the item will be returned to Amazon.  I would nto recommend this product. spend a little more money and get a better model.,3,0,905
A2PG51M646MILA,22,Most other reviews here cover the basics of this item. I had been looking for an iPad cover for a while one just like this. with the iPad on the left and a paper notepad on the right. I had this on backorder for a while and when the ship date kept getting pushed further and further back. I cancelled and opted for a cheaper alternative from Sleek. I immediately regretted it and ordered this Moleskine product as soon as it became available again.This is exactly what I was looking for. The construction is excellent. as I would expect from Moleskine. The inside is soft and the stitching is immaculate. I gave the Functionality 4 stars just because of the lack of a pen holder or anywhere practical to clip my pen. but other than that. its a really great product. It holds the iPad securely. and the notepad is the perfect size.For those who were looking for replacement notepads but couldnt find them. you can get them direct from moleskineus.com. I ordered a small stockpile as I get through notebooks very quickly. and they are exactly the same notebook as the one that ships with this case.If youre looking for an iPadnotepad combo. this is the one to get. Worth every penny!,4,1,1181
A2PGFYY0HTWU4B,11,This product works extremely well if it is working that is.  There are no problems with the earbud part. but as most reviewers have said before me. the microphone is what causes most problems.  Earhugger claims that the headset works with most soundblaster compatible sound cards. but they fail  to mention that the microphone only works in Mono mode which means that  most new sound cards wont be able to use it since they work in Stereo  mode.  The remedy is to simply buy an adapter that converts the plug from  mono to stereo. and everything will work fine.  I bought my adapter at  Radio Shack for USD. and it was pretty easy to find.  Overall. a good  product. but poor support.,3,0,684

A2PLKZ6IW9MXRZ,33,After reviewing the opinions on this unit a friend of mine and myself decided to make the purchase anyway. There were 5 star and 1 star reviews. After several days of testing the two new units on our motorcycles and while on a 2.000 mile road trip we simply put the units in our saddle bags and never turned them on again. Both transmission and reception distances are shameful. Even when using No ground plane antennas. Straight hand held to hand held transmission distance was only about 300 feet. We also got the same results when transmitting and receiving from a motorcyle that had a built in CB. His Trans and Rec was great but ours was terrible. The unit is fantastic for receiving weather info but it should not be listed to communicate for 2 miles. 2 is more like it.,1,0,776
A2PLRI4BX7SU27,35,These microphones are fuzzy sounding I probably wouldnt buy it again but it looks cool and is simple at times. The cords do tangle easy and is short,3,0,148
A2PLYIX1BQ2YZ9,0,I bought the MZR37 early this summer.  I got a refurbished model on Ebay for a resonsable price for recording concerts over the summer.  This is a great model. durable and very shock resistant.  I purchased a binaural microphone after I recorded a couple shows on a cheaper mono and man what a difference.  One major tip if you are starting to record with the MZR37  be sure to hold the record button in place and be sure recording has commenced. I missed some songs at gigs because the recorder didnt start.  Better to be safe than sorry.  Anyway. this is also great for recording MP3s off of your computer just get a connection line from your sound card to the line in and you are set.  You can also transfer concert recordings or band demos onto you computer if you have a recordable sound card.  Great investment.  Forget about MP3 players. too expensive to add memory.  Minidiscs are inexpensive and far more durable than CDs also. with identical sound quality.  If you are a music fan I dont know how you could live without one.,5,1,1034
A2PM4N5MZQRKB6,3131,I bought these to use on my treadmill in the basement while watching TV at night .and not have to blast the TV and wake up my kids..  Unfortunately. I am going to have to find another solution.  There is a tuning dial on the headset that you adjust to pick up the frequency of the base transmitter.  It never sounds great  always a background hissing noise.  I can live with that but I get maybe 35 minutes of use before the sound goes to complete static.  Once I set it in the base charger overnight. it seems to work again the next day.  The battery doesnt seem to charge properly.  The manual claims about 18 hours of use with a full charge.  I am certainly not getting that.  When I am using the product it is never more than 5 feet away from the base.Like a dope. I threw the box away right after I opened it. so its mine to keep.  I will try to change the battery to see if that helps .accessing the battery is a pain. but does not require a factory return. as stated in a previous post.  Anyone can do this in under 5 minutes..,1,0,1034
A2PM4ZSP28ZXIH,22,I have for years been a fan of Maxell products both for their quality and price. This product is another reason for my opinion of Maxell. It is easy to use. great price and results in higher performance from my CD and DVD players.,5,1,230

A2POF8BS0Q3QT7,0,Received this. As soon as I plugged it in it began buzzing.The buzzing doesnt stop until you unplug it from the USB. I ve had one of these before. Theyre not supposed to buzz like that. Clearly a malfunction that the seller didnt disclose.,1,0,239

A2PQCGILB4QFXV,33,I was disappointed in the unit in that it didnt seem loudenough for a Boombox of this quality. The specs indicate that it has26 watts per channel when actual I believe is 6 watts.The unit was the Best looking boombox I have ever seen but looks arent everything! I purchased it based the 15 other people .Amazon. who had rated it an average of 5 stars.Here are my observations.The FM tuner is not sensitive enoughI have a cheaper radio that gets clearer reception. The cassette player is an autoreverse. After having an autoreverse before. this may the first part of the unit to fail. If you have heard the u0026quotclicksu0026quot when it determines which side to play. you probably know what I mean.  The CD player sounded strong and clear. but overall I think the unit does not have enough power to drive the main speakers and the woofers. I do have to admit that at a volume rating of 50 the sound was still very clear.The solution might possibly be to buy the higher powered unit for USD100 more. I returned the unit to Amazon for a refund. They were extremely accomodating and I am sure to purchase from Amazon in the future!  END,2,0,1135
A2PQDQZQFUWUGK,1722,I work at a university in California as a maintenance worker.  My boss and I have to keep in touch in order to best meet the needs of our housing residents.  Before we used the Cobra Micro Talk 1 we relied on our campus  pager system.  This was not an effective method since we had to find campus  phones and wait until the other person responded to the page.  With the  Micro Talk 1 we are able to connect quickly and effectively.  We can now  communicate in seconds instead of minutes. The battery life is long because  of the standbye feature. we have been able to use them for several weeks  before the batteries run low.  The only down side to the Micro Talk 1 is  that we sometimes have to deal with other radio traffic because of the  twochannel limitation.,4,1,764

A2PSBXHPJIXJ6J,0,Ive been using my Nook Color since the when it first came out.  I was initially intrigued by how easily it would be to root and turn into a full fledged tablet. and then after a few software updates from Bu0026N I found the stock software to be the most stable.As for performance. it gets decent battery life. and the stock software is decent. but not the best.  Right now it is the most stable in my opinion. but other ROMs have features that would be great to integrate into the Nook Color.The expandable MicroSD memory slot is great! I love that I can increase my memory when I need to without having to buy a new device.The touch screen is responsive and the bright.  Its easy to read from this device for a few hours without eye strain.Overall I like my Nook Color. its very compact and easy to carry with you and it does its job well.,4,1,840

A2PYFGTDOKIAO9,0,Works great . cheap plastic knobs crumble and fall off.  The  PL258 connector had bad threads from the factory I could not screw the PL259 connector from my Wilson antenna completely! had to replace it with a Radio Shack PL258 connector.,4,1,237
A2PYL7WLGVIBT7,0,I bought them to replace the ones I have in use that have broken clips. Next time I pull my computer mess err desk apart I will replace them.,4,1,141
A2PYUJ1GUKSCRL,0,Lets make it short story. It extremly difficult to find the setup where the sounds is clear. And when it works its for an extremly short period of time. I would not recommend this item at all.,1,0,192
A2PZ9IQI5ZSVEC,0,I purchased this for my 96 year old mother. who loves to read. but her eyesight is not good. She would hold the book in her lap and use a handheld magnifying glass to read. Now she can hold or lean the Nook on a pillow and read to her hearts content!! The ability to adjust the sizing of the words is what sold me. and its also good for me to email and check Facebook!!,4,1,369
A2PZOX90DZC2K8,0,Head set didnt work out of the box. I could hear called party but they couldnt hear me.  Went to Radio Shack and got stereo adapter.  Plugged in mono jack of headset to stereo adapter and then plugged it into sound card.  After that. headset  worked fine.  Very comfortable.  You will have to buy y adapter to plug into  output port so you have two outputs and can plug in both headphones and  speakers at same time.  Otherwise. you will have to always pull speaker  plug out and insert headphones to use headset and then pull out headset  plug and insert speaker plug to use speakers.  I would rather use y adapter  than to have to physically swap plugs all the time.,3,0,668
A2PZZ5SUZW1NSZ,1717,This was a good camera. until I upgraded to Windows 2000.  They offer absolutely no support for Windows 2000 with this cam. no drivers. they dont respond to emails either.  Now its sitting on my desk collecting dust because I dont want to downgrade to 98.  Not worth it.  Get a camera from a respectable company like logitech if you are buying.,1,0,344
A2Q0G3YO4HTH0O,1515,I connected my desktop computer to my laptop computer within 10 minutes .including setting up the software on both computers..  I was able to transfer files and access programs on either computer without ANY problems.  My only complaint .and I believe it has more to do with Microsoft  Networking. not USBnet. is that I now have a signon dialog I have to go  through .User Name. Password. on both computers.  Great product. fast  connection. and it lets me share my SCSIbased Zip drive u0026amp scanner with  my notebook computer!,5,1,530
A2Q12G0CRKK0KP,1313,Got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center. In essence. they work. They are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords. holding them in one. neat bundle. They arent really meant for identifying cables.  but for holding several in a bundle. Because they work great. I cant give them less than 4 stars. USD3 and change is pretty cheap. but if you wanted. you could do the same job with much cheaper products.  which is why I didnt give it 5 stars.Summary. Works great. Cheap. but cheaper options available.,4,1,534
A2Q1DN2CTKBPVW,11,This is a sturdy and well made power strip.  I especially like the colored strips that come with it to help you organize the cords from the various electronics you plug into it.,4,1,177
A2Q287H26O488Q,0,As these tapes are becoming obsolete. it was a nice find before I am forced to upgrade. no problems here.,4,1,105
A2Q3BW3177V542,0,If youre looking for a tablet PC. save your money and just buy a tablet PC. This is not a tablet PC. If you manage to root this device .voiding your warranty. you still wont have bluetooth. GPS. a camera. HDMI. nor the ability to easily connect your Nook to your monitor. TV. printer. keyboard. or mouse. You will only have internet access when youre near wifi. no option of 3G service.If youre looking for an eReader. just buy a regular eReader. The reading experience on the Nook is NOT the same as classic eReaders. which seem to have more of a paper appearance to their screens. Reading on the Nook is just okay and is best in sunlight. Im not too thrilled about reading on this while in bed. for instance. as its not as gentle on the eyes when compared to regular eReaders. If youre not used to reading on a regular eReader. this might not be a problem at all for you. If you like the eReader experience. these types of devices will disappoint. While you can change the background color and dim the screen. it is a far inferior reading experience.I. personally. purchased this device believing there would be some setting that would make the reading experience like one on a regular eReader. While the Nook has a lovely screen and beautiful Netflix playback. its not a good eReader unless youre reading a lot outdoors.I bought this knowing that the app selection was poor. but not realizing just how poor it really is. Bu0026N seriously needs to open up this device for more learning apps. After my initial disappointment. I just figured I would let my children have my Nook. It *seems* to be great for kids as they can use the various learning tools. and theyre more likely to reread books than I am. But. when it came to looking for various math. spelling. and other learning material for my 7 and 10 year old sons. the selection was dismal at best!Its cool to play Angry Birds on a larger screen to the tune of 3 bucks per version... and Drawdle is a huge hit with my boys. but the excitement sort of ends there. The excitement really ended after I paid 2 bucks for a spelling app that isnt even compatible with my device. The way the market is locked down. that shouldnt even be possible! As for Netflix. well... how many places will I have wifi and the time and ability to watch a movie also? At home I can just watch Netflix on the big screen TV. It would be most useful for long car rides if you have mobile hotspot on your phone. But. of course. streaming from your mobile hotspot will just eat up your monthly usage!All in all. I say its a very confused device. If youre looking to buy this. save yourself the money and just buy the Nook Color for USD169. The tablet is a little faster and a little lighter in weight. but USD250 sort of exceeds this devices usefulness. I was also planning to read library books on my Nook... only to learn that I dont have access to the Overdrive app in order to do so. If there is some roundabout way to accomplish this. I just havent put in the time to investigate.I honestly think this device is best suited for kids just because big touch screens are fun. In the end its an oversized android phone without the market... or the phone lol. Its a cool toy for a kid .maybe 818 years of age. to have for the family on a budget. I guess. But to me. its starting to feel like a waste of money. Im not too keen on the reading experience. and while both of my kids are just dying to get time on the Nook. the learning app selection is *severely* limited. However. as my kids arent as picky as I am. they would actually get some use out of this device as an eReader. Yet. since this doesnt seem to be a device designed for kids. I do wonder how long it will take them to break it. =p,3,0,3726
A2Q401QUUQVOB3,34,The  Micro  description is misleading.  This is a normal sized security lock. and a darned good one.  Just dont buy it if you have one of the smaller slots on the Samsung ATIV ultrabooks.,4,1,187

The crack on the right side that was not detailed in the description is fully through the front panel. Im not very happy as this should have been mentioned in the description and should have cost less. It doesnt intefere with the running of the machine but it is not very nice looking and I have to be careful.The system was not set to default and I had to do that myself.The case was in great shape just a little dirty.,2,0,537

A2Q7QOQTWLLQMA,1,I should preface this review by stating that Im predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky. but do appreciate good industrial and UI design.The NC is really a great color eReader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific. Android based tablet.  BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader. but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down. it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to nonBN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works. looks. and reads very well. easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded nonBN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder. placing said free books on the book shelf. or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To nontechies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget. e.g.. Grandma. itd be a showstopper.  But then again. would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies. again wellhidden in the file system. look great. but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance. my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies arent playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so thats the issue.  Again. annoying. but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough. compatible enough messing around. but if I were going to really do some research. Id use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January. and a BN approved Android market. itll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember. its an exceptional value given the hardware .fast processorGPU combination. GREAT IPS LCD screen with better colorresolution then an iPad.. 512MB RAM. expandable storage. great build quality.. and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email. better browser. and a more format flexible musicvideo player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros.Great screen  overall looks. color quality. text quality. adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design  it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor  fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life .for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range.Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processorGPURAM is quite powerful though not tops. but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons.THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled .though it may be Bluetooth ready.No microphone .and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches.Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high. though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazinenewspaper reader especially.

A2Q7WCRAJB1Y83,55,I .like many others. use the radios when riding my snowboard.The sound quality cant be faulted. both sending and receiving are crystal clear .and now private.. Wearing it all day you can now hear when people are paging you. not just when standing in line.Now the bad the build quality should be questioned. the speaker inside the earbod rattles around in mine. and the u0026quotPTTu0026quot button is difficult to press when wearing gloves. The earbuds a little big for my ear. and isnt as comfortable as it could be .although it fits under my helmet fine..The other problem Ive had with this is that it pops out of the headphone jack on the radio with annoying regularity. Ive solved this with duct tape. which isnt pretty but it is functional....,2,0,748
A2Q8OTDJL0YI5P,911,This is my third Palm and the best yet. I chose the the IIIx because of the 4meg and the fact that it uses AAA batteries. I travel often and cannot worry about keeping the Palm in a cradle to recharge. The V is a  disappointment unless you are only into style and keeping a few  appointments and addresses. The 2meg is a huge downside and is only good  for the casual user. If you use Avantgo daily. then the V is going to hold  you back from fully utilizing this great site.The Vx. which is still pricy.  is an 8meg unit and far beyond the needs of the average user.If price is no  object. then this a great unit. except for the recharging needs of being  in a cradle.  At its current pricing. there is no question that the IIIx  is the best valued PDA in the marketplace .,5,1,774

A2Q9AZ94DNOY4K,0,Despite a very cooperative Customer Service department. I have only been able to synch my Nook Color with my iPhone and iPad once and that was accomplished after deleting both apps and reinstalling and even then the synch was from the end of the previous days read.  Ive also had an issue with the screen being too sensitive. sometimes zooming ahead two or three pages.  Several times while reading the screen would .without touching it. go back 10 to 20pages leaving me to have to glance forward a page at a time until a landed back on the current page.I tried to return the unit to B u0026 N only to be told that the 2week period had expired and I should continue calling Cust Service for help.Id like to sell it on eBay but afraid that the buyer would also be disappointed and give me a negative feedback.So Im back to Kindle with its WhisperSync and loving it on my iPad 2 and my Nook is in the drawer.,1,0,906

A2QA5IYHYK0SAC,0,One out of two never worked right out of the box. and the other is a pretty lousy piece of equipment. You can buy the same thing at Radio Shack for a slightly higher price .if you want to buy such an unreliable item.. but its much easier to return nonfunctioning junk to a real store than it is to mail crap back to Amazon or an Amazon seller. I wouldnt even recommend this as a childrens toy. much less as a serious headset.,1,0,425

A2QCJUKW8ULMKG,1,Gosh. I think Ive had my Rio 500 Diamond for over a year and a half... AWESOME. Im gonna buy my first memory card tonight.  Never really needed it.  As long as you put songs 3 minutes or under. you can get quite a bit of music on it.  Right now I have 14 tracks ranging from 6 minutes 1.25 .on average 3 min..  I love it for running...small. light weight...unlike walkmans or portable CD players.  The case is very protective .dont worry about dropping. it wont be phased. and has a clip which is very sturdyholds in place even with loose running shorts while running!  Turn off backlight to conserve battery .as with all electronics..  Ive never used the bookmark.  Random feature is great for speeding up the download time .dont have to organize order to seperate songs by the same artist..  Rio software is easy and fairly quick.  CD quality sound as far as Im concerned. only better cuz theres no skipping.  Head phones are good. but Ive found louder.not necessarily better..  They thinly and conveniently wrap around your ear to stay on your head and leave your hair free.  Nice style. compact size.  If you plan on going on long trips and dont like listenting to the same songs over and over. a minidisk player is probably better.  This was a gift from a person who did a lot of research at the time and said it was the best on the market.  And by the way. Rios were also the first!,5,1,1388
A2QD5TYJ0VP5YM,22,Ive tried these speakers for 6 months and could not get a clean signal from my transmitter to the speakers.  This resulted in an awful hissing noise.  My experience was the same whether I was running off of batteries or off of the AC adapter.  The distance between the transmitter and speakers was between 5ft .line of sight. and 10ft .through drywall..If you are expecting the quality of 900Mhz cordless phones. look elsewhere.For what its worth. my RCA WSP150 speakers were refurbished.I have put these bulky duds to rest.,2,0,524
A2QDSCVMNRKTA9,66,I choose only one star because the remote control didnt work .

I did everything I can to make it work with no luck .

A2QG4OHOWO34YS,11,I wish I could give 0 stars. Like many of the other reviewers. our laptop lock reset...while locked to our nightstand in a hotel room in Italy. We used the laptop lock successfully for about a year. so we were quite sure of the combination. And when we went to unlock the laptop this time. the combo didnt work. My husband began trying each of the possible 10.000 combinations. and after two hours of sitting in a hotel room instead of being on our actual vacation. we borrowed cable cutters from the hotel and cut the lock. in about 25 seconds .so the lock is worthless anyway.. Back at home. he continued trying to find the combo to get the lock out of the actual computer .after trying to cut it out  didnt work. and finally hit upon the winning reset combination as 4444. This product is completely worthless and the company should be sued. especially since they are now fully aware of the defect and yet continue to sell the same product! Incredible! We didnt even try calling the company considering the response others received  I wasnt about to add to my frustration by making an expensive. international phone call as useless as the product itself. Unfortunately. we bought our lock before all these reviews popped up. but hopefully. so many customers experiencing the same problem will help future buyers.,1,0,1315

I looked at a lot of 10BaseT hubs. and found this one to be among the least expensive with the best satisfaction ratings. I am especially impressed with the hubs small size and metal case  other hubs are larger and have plastic cases.To me. the best recommendation for a piece of network hardware is that you never have to think about it. it just works. This hub gives me that in spades.,5,1,476
A2QGTGBNVJIW9W,44,I purchased a Diamond RIO 300 almost a year ago. and I definitely say it has been great.  The one problem Ive had was with the battery compartment. When Diamond designed the RIO. they took the duracell ultra batter and  built the RIO around it. Low and behold. the Duracell Ultra tends to be  bigger then most AA batteries. so I had problems when using rechargable  batteries .stupid me. saving the environment. that made the RIO shut down  every time it was bumped.  Diamond addressed this issue in a knowledge base  .which was hard to find. and basically said u0026quotshove something in there  to make the battery fit.  I use foil now .which sometimes makes the  compartment pop open. but only when its in my backpack. and havent had  much problems yet.  However. Diamonds tech support is very horrible in  trying to get merchandise replaced .which Ive tried with my rio and other  diamond products..  Ill probably purchase a RIO 500 just because it has a  better battery compartment design.,4,1,994
A2QGWWFYNE4JAC,33,The keyboard is not bad as a whole. with most keys appropriately sized. and convenient.  But the  key is much too small. and the Windows key and the menu key are very misplaced and almost always cause mistakes.  The  should be outside the ctrl and alt keys. not interspaced.Additionally.  the cursor keys and the alternate keys .home. end. delete. page up. page  down. and insert. are easily the worst ive ever seen.  Theyre about as  big as tictacs and completely out of order.  It took me 2 months to stop  making mistakes on them.  Bad choices all around.,1,0,558

A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,18,I know nexttonothing about photography and I was not ready to pull the trigger on a digital camera.  I had been carrying a Minolta u0026quotFreedom Zoom 90u0026quot around for about 10+ years. and I was looking for a replacement that would .a. fit into my briefcasebackpack more easily. and .b. be a little bit more idiotproof .I always seemed to have problems focusing the Minolta..After a bit of research. I choose the Canon Elph 370Z.  After 6+ months of ownership. I am reporting back here as a very satisfied customer.  The 370Z has met or exceeded both of my goals.  It is extremely portable. allowing me to take my camera everywhere with a neglible weight penalty.  And. Im taking better photos. and its still the same ol me that used the old camera.  My focus problems have disappeared.  Furthermore. Ive blown a couple of the photos up to an 8u0026quotx12u0026quot scale and they retain an amazing level of crispness for such a small camera.The only drawback .noted in other reviews here. is that the unit is so compact that the flash is still too close to the lens.  So remember. redeye reduction is just that. reduction. not elimination.Still. all in all. a highly recommended purchase.,5,1,1197

One thing which I really miss is a dedicated handle for a pen. It is possible to stick a pen next to the notebook but it is a bit inconvenient.

A2QO9SH6XTPYE3,12,i was intrigued by the design and in the store that i bought it it sounded really nice. but when i got home and took it out. i was dissapointed in the sound quality. it sounds good with low volume but when u turn it up it gets  distorted. the speakers cannot take much. At first theres a noticeable  squeaking when a cd is playing but thankfully it went away. If looks is  what you are looking for then this is the one to get. but performance wise  i dont think so.,2,0,465

A2QTGLNWW1K1JD,2,I recently purchased a Palm V. it is the best time mgmt. tool I have owned. The only draw back is the memory capacity. the V was my first organizer so I was not sure how much memory I would need for all my office  activities. I know now. I want MORE MEMORY!,4,1,257
A2QTJOOTOYTWCR,34,Its a nice player for anyone who wants a simple. cheap portable CD player. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband last year. but I probably get the most use out of it.

A2QU7CRN2BAC4H,0,Gives excellent digital pictures and 7 second still shots. Light weight with easy hand control. The only draw back is the ONOFF record button has a delay action when turning off.

You can get one 10 times better for the same price. Try Cannon. Nikon. HP ......  Kodak is not the anwser!!!!!!,2,0,583
A2QVLL7FLE3K54,35,boss bought several of these. I have seen two of them mysteriously reset their own combo somehow. i think it just comes down to cheap construction. they jiggle the wrong way and reset which especially sucks if it happens while it is attached to your laptop. .like it did to me. the older ones with the black plastic are apparently easy to pick. the new ones with the red plastic casing seem impossible to pick. this is an expensive bad product i would suggest buying a combo lock which you can reset yourself with a key. that way you dont have to take a hacksaw to it when you forget the combo. or the lock forgets its own combo or whatever..oh yeah and I cut through the cable like butter with bolt cutters,1,0,707
A2QXLPVEJBD4CN,11,A few weeks ago I was unaware of the existence of the GE Superadio.  I had never heard of it.  I learned of it through links I found while looking for the Henry Kloss Tivoli Model One.  Some of the reviews of the GE Superadio gave the impression that in was cheaply made and might be defective out of the box.  I was particularly concerned about the negative evaluations of the tuner.  With the price at fortyfive dollars. though. I decided to take a chance on it. and Im sure glad I did.  Its a great radio. and I find the tuner on mine quite adequate.  Perhaps GE read the reviews and has corrected the problems some reviewers found with the tuner.  Anyway. I bought the GE for fortyfive and the Henry Kloss Model one for a hundred and twenty. and I love them both.  I put them on different sides of my bedroom. tune them to the same station. and get stereo from two radios that each have a single speaker.  At night I listen to love songs on the stations over in Mexico. and the sound from these two radios is really giving me a lot of pleasure.  For a total of about one hundred and sixtyfive dollars. Id say these two radios are giving me a thousand dollars worth of happiness.,5,1,1182
A2QXVIH1Q44FSD,45,I decided NOT to purchase this item afterall when I saw that shipping was 19.95!  I can buy a bag locally for as much as I would pay for this one including shipping cost!,1,0,170
A2QXZONNG411FW,0,This MiniDisc Player has almost everything. It is almost everything youd want from a high end MiniDisc at a cheaper price. However. there are a couple of things that keep it from receiving a full five stars .which I really think it deserves. from a technical standpoint. It is a little thick. which does not bother me at all. but compared to others. this is a problem. It is a relatively old model .but is still worth the money that I paid  and it is now even cheaper.. It doesnt have a PC link cable that some sonys have and even a Sharp model has. .Though an analogue connection can be made using the u0026quotsoundoutu0026quot from the sound card and two cables like the one it brings  most portable cd players bring one so many of you probably already have the other neccesary one.. It brings a digital cable. However. the type it includes does not allow from one MD to another. The battery is great but it would be useful if. like some of the other MDs. this model had the abiliity to play off of just AA bateries .yet. since it has a rechargable battery. whod want AA batteries  and it does include a battery case to extend battery life. Unlike some newer models. the only u0026quotindiglou0026quot LCD is the remote control. It would be cool if the main LCD could have this feature.  Overall. this MD is worth the money. It works and looks better than MANY of the newer and more expensive MDs. If you would like a high quality. relatively inexpensive. portable MiniDisc playerrecorder. that looks great. this is for you. Though no current MiniDisc playerrecorder has all of the features discussed. it is hard to make this a 5 star player when Sharp could easily one day announce a new model containing them.,4,1,1714
A2QY2STZXLA4Y8,77,This player is great if youre just getting into the DVDs.  Now. it doesnt have all the bells and whistles. but if youre looking for quality and reliablility in a DVD player. then the Sony DVPS330 is the way to go.  Its priced very nicely. and you get plenty of bang for your buck.The  player has all the essentials. Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS support. although  it does not have a built in decoder.  Many of the reviews I have read speak  of a mysterious soundsynch issue. in which the sound is not perfectly in  synch with the video.  I have watched hundreds of movies on my player. and  from what Ive seen. the problem is nonexsistent.  The remote is very easy  to use. and will even control your television and surround receiver.  provided they are both sony brand. I have had mine for about a year and  have experienced absolutely no problems with it. aside from watching  scratched up DVDs from blockbuster because some people just dont care for  them.  This is a great buy. and anyone who says otherwise needs to check  their research.,5,1,1040
A2QYH0JNDSB7CT,6263,If you want an ereader. get an ereader  the battery dies in a few hours .or a couple. depending on brightness settings.. If you want a tablet. get a tablet. There are far better options for a similar price. If all you want to do is read magazines and buy a few apps. fine. But this thing is truly lacking. Ive owned mine for 6 months. and havent changed my mind about it yet.UPDATE. The product gets even worse with age. It will not fully charge. ever. and at 15% it goes crazy. It runs all sorts of apps. closes them. types things into the browser. and wont let you use the tablet at all. This may not seem like a big deal. but it is unacceptable. 15% should still be enough to read for a bit. rather than going psycho and taking over the device.,1,0,747

A2R2DWH05NZ2NV,0,Those of you who enjoy recording. but dont have recording sounds system on you itouch or ipod. This product is perfect! I had purchased this item about 2 months already. and I tested it while recording my piano solos. it sounded great! There are times when the playback can be screechy. but thats only because the song or sound might had been to near or loud to the recording. I give this product 45 stars since I have an I phone. it wasnt much use. But I highly suggest those who have Ipods or Itouch get this product. ^^,4,1,522

A2R3RAEJR23YVL,0,I bought the C2000 over the summer. and Olympus enclosed a mailin certificate for free NiMH batteries and charger. The NiMH batteries largely fixed the battery problem .before. I had to carry a pile of spare  alkakines.. Im not sure how Olympuss folks signed off on some strangeness  in the mechanical design .wayward lens cap. oddlyplaced strap attachment  things. power switch  shutter button placement.. Also. the Flashpath  .floppy. adapter is a major pain to use. The PCMCIA adapter is simpler and  works better. A PCMCIA reader for a desktop PCMAC is cheap. An included  case would have been nice. Olympus sells one for this camera. but no one  ever has it in stock. I dont even know what it looks like.Having said  that. Im very pleased with picture quality and ease of use. Resolution and  color are excellent. The automatic mode tends to overexpose flash pictures  taken in some situations .like across a dark room.. but the overrides for  shutter and aperature priority work well. You can also finetune the  exposure. among other things. and still use the fullyauto mode.Bottom  line. an amazing piece of technology takes excellent photos .for a digital  camera. very good value for its capabilities.,4,1,1210

A2R4GEWPLORVSO,0,I bought the blue logger and both Street atlas 2005 and SA2005 HH for my Dell X50V. No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows.1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional USD39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use. not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed. and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim. it is slow. Worse yet. the route is often wrong. FOr example. this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friends house. Had I followed that route. I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily. I decided to use my paper map. Later. I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location. SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily. I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it. I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example. if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel. the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess thats why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my USD50 learning mistake. and looking at Microsoft Street u0026 Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005. IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map.I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum. I wish I had read that forum before buying Delorme software. Well. Live and Learn.,2,0,2250

A2R6RA8FRBS608,13,TDK manufactures excellent six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audiovisual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment. these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a noncopyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space and this is useful when recording television shows. for example.In addition. you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time. four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. .You use your VCR to set this.. The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say theyre satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of viewing enjoyment because you record onto them over and over again countless times although after some use the picture quality will eventually begin to gradually deteriorate.Unfortunately. these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if. hypothetically. you were to copy a DVDR onto another DVDR instead of a TDK blank VHS tape. the quality of the audiovisual media on the DVDR copy would be sharper and clearer than a TDK tape or any other brand of video tape could give you. Moreover. VHS tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow front edge of each VHS tape which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The VHS tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall. TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand for many years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK premium quality six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape.,4,1,2267
A2R6RA8FRBS608,1213,Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment. these tapes record the sounds of record albums. radio shows. CDRs. people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape. as one reviewer correctly notes. make it good for recording lectures and music using standard. less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of USD6.75 for the fifteenpack you spend roughly 45 cents per tape and thats very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times and they take up very little room so theyre easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately. these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if. hypothetically. you were to copy a CDR onto another CDR instead of a Maxell cassette tape. the quality of the sound on the CDR copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XLII but its still not the same as a digitized CDR recording. Moreover. cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times. too. Therefore. I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall. Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music. the radio. people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.,4,1,2556

Make sure you have a phone with a good belt clip that isnt too heavy to carry around.  The only downside to the headset is that there is no volume control and no mute button. so its best to get a phone that has these functions in the phone itself.  I use it with a couple of different cordless phones and it performs flawlessly with both.,4,1,550
A2RA2SK1H0WLQG,22,Im writing this review at the urging of Amazon.Com. but its really a bit early. I bought a couple of Maxell VP100 Dry Video Head Cleaners because I planned to copy a lot of old VHS tapes to DVD on my new VCRDVD recorder.  Ive successfully used it about five times total on three VCRs. In the last attempts. when I inserted the cartridge. it immediately started rewinding. and I had to stop it and hit play. It doesnt always play. This has happened on two VCRs. So...the jurys still out on this product.  I think Im supposed to get about 100 uses.  Ill come back and edit my review if I have any new information.,3,0,611
A2RB7KPCTJEP4Z,1,I just plugged it in and it simply worked  both on my PowerBook 1400 running OS 8.6 .which exploits it as an extended memory hack. and on my Titanium PowerBook running OS 9 and OS X. I have iPhoto set NOT to launch when the card is inserted on the TiBook.I gave 4 stars because it arrived quickly and did the job as advertised with no hassles. .To merit 5 stars. it should have had better documentation and a more detailed troubleshooting guide..,4,1,446

A2RBMWT2ZB95JY,12,First I want to say I am very happy with the talking SPIII.  It is does a pretty good job routing and if you drive off the route it will autorecalc a new route for you. I have used numerous GPSs in the past and this does a great job for driving .for biking or hiking I HIGHLY recommend the Garmin 12 Map. my favorite GPS..Now there are some things to know about this product however.  First you get a CD that allows you to download maps from your PC to your Steetpilot.  It works over either serial or USB .USB goes to a 32MB memory card that you can plug in..  The CD contains maps of the US BUT... you only get to select one region of the US for free.  The rest of them you must pay for from Garmin for approx USD116 a shot .USD291 total for the total US..  You can purchase this online at Garmins web site and they will give you a key to open up the different regions. The base map. the one built into the Garmin. on the GPS is still u0026quotgoodu0026quot for the whole US but the CD give MUCH better detail.  I am not complaining about this since the maps seem pretty up to date.  The road I live on is 2 years old and no other mapping software to my knowledge has it as part of their data but the Garmin software did.Another thing to note is the form factor for the StreetPilot III and the older street pilots are different.  this can be important if you order from Garmin direct accessories like the bean bag mount .as I found out..,5,1,1439
A2RDR057SG0TI8,5051,I got this pair of 16x binoculars and the 10x. I normally use the wide eye piece setting of 70mm that most grown men use. and this pair only goes to 65 at best. I compared to the new 10x and an old 7x pair from 40 years ago... The quality from 40 years ago cant be matched by either pair. but the 10x pair does spread to 70mm. and are usable... But this 16x pair is useless.,1,0,374
A2RDYKH7PNBLGZ,1,The signal stinks and I actually went back to roof mount to get a better signal.  I wouldnt waste the money!,1,0,108
A2RE0O7KSG210,0,The Nook came as advertised.  It dose what they say it will do.  However. I am disappointed in the way Nook manages the table of contents in books.  I bought it to put my scriptures and other religious material on it.  If you want to look something up in the New or Old Testament it is very awkward to go table of contents and get to the book and chapter you are looking for in a timely manner.,3,0,394
A2RFEVAOOH05JN,23,I just received the Nook as a birthday gift and I havent been able to put it down since I got it. It is very easy to use once you get used to it adn learn the ins and outs. I am currently in school so being able to put all my ebooks from each course on the Nook is a definite bonus. I can take all my course books with me in my purse. I would like to be able to use Word documents but the fact that I can convert documents that I need to take with me to a PDF. is sufficient.,4,1,475
A2RGMR2L4UYCRJ,22,I was happy with this product for a year. Funny how the warrenty is a year. Just after the warrenty was up it stopped working and customer service was useless. The suggestion I got was to buy a new one... I will buy a new one but not this brand.,2,0,245
A2RGYNB3Q44XPN,11,The design of this case causes the contrast button to be pressed constantly when the case is attached to the right hand side of the Palm .the way that most left handed users would place their Palm in the case..  This renders the Palm unusable.  Moreover. the constant pressure on the contrast button results in the contrast being turned all the way up. which causes the screen to be appear totally blank even when the Palm is turned on.  The user must reset the contrast without being able to see the contrast slider on the screen.,1,0,531
A2RJ5NESNRUM7P,22,This cd player looks really cool and it plays well. but theheadphones .stink..  The antishock works very well.  Everything works well except the headphones.,4,0,156
A2RLMRF0W90JE7,1317,Good radio with the felxibility to be operated as an incar radio or as a walkietalkie.  Some complaints about low volume seem to me to be unfounded. but I do not know what kind of vehicle the complainers were in.  I drive a stock Jeep Wrangler 4door .JK. and it was plenty loud.  Range would probably be better if I tuned the external antenna but this radio is not a fullup base unit with a 108 inch whip.  I think it is a good value for the money.,4,1,448
A2RMCEP8BEXWY1,11,I purchased this item and it did not fit my phone. Although it said that it would fit all the versions mine did not fit. I would just purchase one from the store where you purchased your original phone.,1,0,202

A2RN5YGKRE01K3,1,I just received my GE SuperRadio today. brought it to work. plugged it in and WOW! I got all the stations anyone could ask for. I work at a factory in the office. and static and interference makes impossible to enjoy music on a normal radio. A friend suggested I try the SuperRadio. and I have all the 60s and 70s songs. at my fingertips. When you get tired of the top 40 all day.  you got lots of options with this radio. It is bigger than most want for desk tops. but the wide band receiver brings in quality music with no static.,5,1,532
A2RNJGSYFOQ7ON,23,A smart purchase. Wasnt exactly what we thought. but worked very well anyhow. Kids VCR was really dirty and this cleaned it up in two seconds. Hope it lasts!,4,1,157
A2RO0PHJNNNEV7,0,I have been using the D340R for 3 months now. and it has performed beautifully.  The pictures are clear and sharp. and the camera menu is intuitive.The only problem that I have with it is that it takes a while  to download the pictures to my computer.  Because it uses a serial  connection. downloading the full 8MB from the camera takes up to 10  minutes.  Some other cameras have parallel or USB connections. but none can  stack up to the quality of the D340R.,5,1,462
A2RP6V1HDF84KD,4243,Light snapped off as I was turningrotating it to shine on the screen.  Must be a bad design.  I would not spend 50USD on it.  Barnes and Noble would not replace it.,1,0,164

A2RSVMXR7Q6384,525,Had clunky 28K modem for three years.  Cant imagine why I waited so long to upgrade.  Installation went  easy.  Logs on at 50K+.  Faster than my new iBook at 46K from same location.  Web pages u0026quotflyu0026quot now.  Dont see why Id want to pay USD40month for a DSL.  Use PII 400 with USB MB.  Plug and Pray worked fine.,5,1,324
A2RTKL29D1QNQZ,23,This product worked very well for me.  I have used it twice and so far so good.  I would definitely advise you to try it.,5,0,121
A2RTPEXII7328Q,12,The lock and cable are very easy to use and feel sturdy. A friend of mine has the same lock and cable and out of curiosity I tried my key on her lock. My key was able to unlock it which led me to believe that the key is universal to this model of laptop lock.,3,0,259
A2RU2K55M9S25C,1819,This was one of Palms real groundbreaking handhelds. with its sleek case and low weight.  Still a great handheld but only has 2 MB of memory and lacks the SD slot that the new Palms are being manufactured with.  If you just need a calendar and address book. this will do it. but the m100 will do just about the same ......with albeit a much smaller screen..  The backlight on the Palm V is woeful like the backlights on all Palms. but is not needed too often.,4,1,459
A2RU2K55M9S25C,56,4 speakers may seem like an odd array. but when you think about how computers are set up. a center speaker may just get annoying.  These little cube speakers pack a lot of punch and deliver very crisp sound. especially if you can plug them into a digital jack on a Soundblaster Live! card.  Another cool feature is the little volume knob that you can place just about anywhere on your desk that lets you control volume and also fade from front to back.  These are great speakers. Ive had them for a year and a half now and they still work wonderfully.  I highly recommend them!,5,1,577
A2RU2K55M9S25C,0,A great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with 3 computers or have a local network of 4 computers.  Either way. the hub has been very reliable and performance has been as promised.  Netgear is known for making quality Ethernet products and this is just another one of them.,4,1,299
A2RU5VHMH3WTJX,0,I got this unit for my birthday. and was blown awaybyit. Almost everything is great about it. but there are flaws. 1. Ifyour trying to listen to it near a tv. it doesnt work because of magnetic fields 2. If you want to plug it into your cigarette lighter in your car. you need to buy an adapter from the company for USD45! 3. The battery doesnt have a very long life. It is 6.5 hrs and takes 3 to chargeThese bad things dont make me hate the product. I love it because. 1. You can record all music formats onto it mp3. cd. cassette. record. 8track. etc. If you want. you can record sounds from your tv or radio! 2. It is very small and easy to use. The remote makes changing tracks easy while your driving. especially at night. the remote has indiglo. like watches 3. You can type in track names. Although people seem to like the jog dial on the 722. I dont think holding down a button until you get the letter you want is such a hassle.  4. If you need to remember something. you can plug your headphones .any. not just the ones that came with it. into the mic jack and record your thoughts.  If you follow what the manual says. you should have no problems,4,1,1157
A2RULKDI00UF1F,3333,I bought this product after doing a lot of price comparisons and reading reviews. I am satisfied with it. The cable is of good quality. I use it to connect my wired Trendnet Broadband router to my laptops.,5,1,205

A2RUVJ0UZQGFFG,0,Ater taking the time to read all of the pros and cons found in the various customer reviews here. I decided to purchase this hard case for my Palm Vx and decide for myself. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the  overall construction. look. feel and perfect fit that this item provides.  This is by far the best way to protect your investment. I also found how  easy it was to use with my hotsynch cradle without taking the plam V  completely out of the case simply raise the cradle a few inches up off  your desk with a book. open the case at a 160 degree angle and the palm  fits very easily on the cradle. This case satisfies all of my criteria for  a product worth buying.,5,1,689
A2RV0CZK36TRBE,2323,it is weak in the night......... you must buy another photoflash...........,2,0,75
A2RV1QSW2QM408,0,Cant seem to get any support from Kensington!  In the booklet it says to download some awardwinning software to make the Orbit Trackball enhanced.  I go to the website and start to down load the software.  but the software says it wont work on PS2 connected trackball and it wont work on the two button trackballs.... Other than that the booklet is great!  So here they make a PS2 trackball with two buttons but their software. of course doesnt support their hardware.  In fact I cant find this model on their website.  The only one I can find is an optical trackball.... Go figure!  Im beginning to think this is a USA company run by foreign incompentents.  To end this pathetic diatribe. I am unable to scroll text. or at least figure a way to do that function.  You would figure a IO device made today would support that important scroll function.  Sorry I am unhappy with it. I tried to accept it into my computer family. but because of its nonsupport of functions I think I need. Ill make it go to the back of my mouse pad and stay there while I get a more capable trackball that will be accepted into my warm productive computer family.  I hope this will teach the little bugger to come better prepared!,1,0,1209
A2RVRA7L2YSXH,0,This thing is awful.  Not only did it not work. when trying to call technical support. I cant get through.  I tried submitting via email my issues. get no response.  I cant get a phone number that will get to a real person.  I would not purchase this product ever again.,1,0,270
A2RW1VJHG8WULS,44,I. like others. bought this product several months ago after having much success with the older. onscreen. model.  This head cleaner made my VCR function even worse than before using it.  I finally had to use my much older .almost worn out. tape in order to get my VCR to function again.  The new Maxell VP100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner is a total piece of junk and a waste of money!,1,0,388
A2RWGZD24R9JK0,0,I thought this was an HD tablet.  IT IS definitely NOT.  It wont run Google play which is needed to play some of the games I like.  I have been shown by a Nook rep @ one of their stores that I can at least download books from my local library which is very important to me.,2,0,273
A2RWI6T2LP0BM1,0,I currently bought this Elph.  I think it is a good starter camera becuase it is so small.  It has good battery life and is easy to setup and use.  However for big people it may prove to be a little to small.  But. overall this is a great Elph.,4,1,244
A2RWI6T2LP0BM1,26,I owned a Rio 600 and it broke.  I got two replacements and they broke too.  Then I traded it for the Rio 500.  I have had no problems with it.  It is a great player and very reliable.  One other think I like is the 64MB of memory.  I bought another 64Mb card and memory is dirt cheap. much unlike the ripoff 600 backpacks.The thing never skips and is ok with batteries.  Not the best but...  If your looking for a great player stop right here.  This rocks and I like it.Some bad stuff it you have to pay for the full software and it likes batteries.,4,1,550
A2RWI6T2LP0BM1,11,I currently own this CD player.  It is a good player and works ok. but there are better ones out there for the price of this one.  .....If you really like this player you would not be let down.  The skip protection is fair but dont even try to run or walk with it.  This player also has a good sound quality and base.However. the headphones that Sony gives you STINK.  They are horrible quality and will brake.  Only recently however I have noticed that with this player when I play a song it shuts off in the middle!!!  Keep in mind though that I got it 3 years ago.Overall ok player.,4,1,585
A2RX85Y4S27N2J,11,This was an old size for an older Nook that was no longer sold in Bu0026N. did not fit my Nook. There was no way to know this before purchase.,1,0,142
A2RYUSRQLCTBCS,23,When I first got my DVD player.  I could not play any of the dual layered disk wiht out some sort of problem.  But i called them and they told me send it back to have it upgraded.

A2RZHSGZAQWBNT,34,This SurgeArrest model wasnt very good. which is misleading when it gives you up to 8 outlets to connect your devices to. It burnt out pretty quickly. and the indicator thats mean to alert you of it no longer working never was lit in the first place.,2,0,250
A2S01PBSIEN6L1,11,Yay!  A gift from the heavens.  As others have said. no instructions or receipt  if its not your first rodeo....perfect.  Well built. but if you are not comfortable rebooting and restoring wo instructions.  look at another.,4,1,223
A2S04Q1TT3L130,0,Best speaker you are going to find at this price. you will not be disappionted.,5,0,79
A2S07OZ1V8UXYT,12,This device came exactly as pictured with a plug in each end. One for the computer and the other for the mouse. I was impressed that they were able to do that with no moving parts or complex electronics. Rated a one because I feel as if Im being force to rate something I pay for. If more people sent in ratings like this maybe Amazon would stop the email barrage.,1,0,364
A2S081Y72FI34Z,1,I purchased this for my dad who uses it in a basement sauna.  The radio sounds nice and is easy to use. but does need to be positioned a bit for good reception.  He is very happy with the radio.,4,1,194
A2S089YNV6Y2D1,0,This thing is great for the price. The most important thing for me is that it feels very sturdy. I cant see my TV falling off the wall with this. It comes with a lot of extra bolts and spacers to make sure it works with all TVs. It does feel pretty stiff and can be hard to move the TV around.,4,1,293
A2S1LD7QXMX9YP,11,Im using the item to record all of my cassettes onto my computer so I can convert them to mp3 files. It works great for that! I was surprised that it didnt have a headphone line out. but oh well.,4,0,195
A2S2MRENW7RODD,88,I was astounded by the simplicity of the installation... I slipped it into a PCI slot. connected it to the soundcard. closed up my computer. and I was ready. Installation of the software only took one minute at most. and when I entered the application for watching TV. the wizard basically configured everything by itself. The sound is great and picture is awesome. I now have the TV Wonder connected to my cable box. and have gotten rid of my TV!I stronly recommend the ATITV Wonder for anyone who is looking for a TV tuner to put into their computer.,5,1,552
A2S33I8S9FJF7,23,At first I was torn between the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Paperwhite. I chose the Nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book. I had though that the Nook did not have a good dictionary function. but learned otherwise after its purchase. All one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the Look Up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left.Sharp resolution. useful utilities. convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen. Lightweight. durable and well designed. Essay to download free books .I suggest Project Gutenberg.. For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library. you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory. Barnes and Noble only allocates 14 of a GIG out of 2GIG for your personal library from non Barnes and Noble books. One gig for software to run the Nook and 34 for books purchased from Barnes. The best buy for external memory is 8 GIG. I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon they are high quality for a reasonable price.,5,1,1214
A2S345OJSSCHTK,0,Worked as I needed it to. Will use vendor again. Quick shipment. good price. Happy with purchase. Would recommend in future,4,1,123

A2S7NL1Q1I1QMX,0,Picture quality is fantastic.  Lots of fun to take visiting.  Couple of negative points though the price for one.  If you have USD1.000.00 you just dont know what to do with. go for it.  Other problem is the battery life.  I dont know for sure on the DVDL50. but on the prior model  the DVDL10  the battery life is less than 2 hours which doesnt get you thru most  DVDs.  Extra batteries are USD200.00.  Hmmmm.  Does run off of AC. but when  youre out and about .i.e. camping yes. really roughing it I know.. that  doesnt do any good.  But. for all of those who are into gadgets and  expensive toys. go for it!,4,1,610
A2S7O09DKY30TH,0,I have had my nook for about 6 months now. and in terms of the product quality. I am fully satisfied. The interface doesnt have the ease of use that I was expecting. but I have only ever used apple touchscreen products so I suppose I had set the bar a bit too high. The only thing that actually bothers me is the lack of control of the organization of the shelves. but its not so bad. In terms of durability. I was happy to see that the product holds up well. and hasnt broken. I also like the way it feels to read on the nook. it doesnt give me a headache and is actually easier than a normal book. All of that being said. I havent used my nook since about three months ago. I had begun to read and buy books. and though I enjoyed reading on the nook. I realized that I liked having a physical book. and watching my book collection expand on the shelf. With the books I owned on the nook. it hardly even felt like I owned them. It was just a file. Because of this. I havent bought any more ebooks. and thus havent really had a reason to use my nook. Once my local library has a better selection of ebooks available. I think I would begin to use it more. But I would only recommend this product if your library has a good selection of ebooks. or if you dont mind not owning a physical book.,4,1,1290
A2SBLOXIY2FI9A,0,I cant tell if it is working. stays in maybe 34 seconds and does not tell you what task it has performed if any,1,0,111
A2SD7X8QWQHI8V,11,One issue you cannot use this unit while charging with AC wall adapter.For some people this is a big issue an example would be a foreman sitting at his desk listening for his crew. or a person wanting to use it as a scanner. So from the get go this was not designed to work 247 setting on a desk or countertop.A dockingstationchargingstation is needed for this unit. Or the AC charge controller needs to set so it can work while charging.ProsEverything else worked as advertised.,3,0,479
A2SE39QPLTEOEN,1,I only use a cb in the jeep on trail rides... so otherwise I dont need to see it or lose the dash space.  I installed an tailgate antenna mount with a pushon antenna adaptor for my radio shap whip antenna.  Ran the coax to under the front passenger seat.  When Im ready for a ride. plug in the cb to the pwr and coax. and pop on my antenna! When back home. remove and go about the daily drivin!,5,1,394

A2SFVAJTL8V4UB,0,I really love this device.  The only problem is. I would not enjoy it nearly as much without the ability to root it and load up a custom ROM.  The stock nook os is sluggish and extremely limited.  The stock app market is a joke.  So if you are willing to dig around to find out how to root this. i would highly recommend getting it.  If not. I would pay a little more for a different android tablet.Good.Screen is great and responsive.The battery life is what I expected...8 or so hours.The device feels solid.  I really like the design and build quality of this device.Cheap. look around you can get it for USD200 refurbished.Bad.Its native operating system is very limited and feels sluggish.,4,1,694
A2SFYPW331W3LP,55,Brought it and tried everything the instructional booklet says but still wont work. And the refund process is overly complicated since I dont even mail this back to Amazons warehouse. I have to directly give this back to EEK. God knows how the hell will I get my refund back. One of biggest mistake of my online purchase.DO NOT. for your own sake. NO NOT but this!!,1,0,365

A2SGR7LE899LGG,45,I had one of these and I replaced it with a Gemini 2 way rewinder which is of a much higher build quality and runs more reliably than this one. The problems I experienced with this Ambico rewinder are. Very noisy. flimsy construction. Door getting stuck at times. Some tapes actually got tangled inside the reel of the tape itself while rewinding the last 12 inches or so. Like I said. if you can still find a Gemini rewinder go for it and ditch this piece of garbage.,2,0,468
A2SH86ESW36J50,1111,Good price and it gets the job done.  Sometimes it stops responding when changing disks. Have to disconnect and reconnect to recover. This may be a driver problem in Windows and not with the drive itself.,3,0,204
A2SHPBBVDCX2CI,0,I purchased my GPS 315 about two months ago and have used it about 20 times for various purposes. The small display and difficulttofollow owners manual made it hard to quickly learn how to use it. Do not expect  assistance from Magellans 1800 help line. they do not answer and do not  call back when you leave a message. But with some patience and practice I  am finding more and more useful. One of the reasons I had purchased the  unit was to help me better establish the locations of the property lines on  my heavilywooded 20 acres. The unit was poorly suited for that purpose due  to the poor accuracy .the manual says 100 meters horizontal accuracy and  150 meters vertical accuracy.. The reason for the poor accuracy was the  deliberate error that was introduced in the signals transmitted from the  Department of Defense satellites. But as of this week. that error has been  essentially eliminated and my subsequent readings have been much. much more  stable and accurate. From what I have read in the news. the elimination of  the error has made even the cheaper GPS receivers accurate to within 30  feet horizontally.I have noted that my batteries do not last as long as  the manual says they should. The manual says they should last up to 15  hours I estimate my batteries have lasted approximately 8 hours.In  summary. I see these lowercost units an exceptionally valuable tool if you  do much traveling. hiking. etc.,4,1,1429
A2SJTV5BRK05MV,6368,I order the RCA remote you sent me a PHILIPS remote. Plus the codes that wassuppost to be in the booklet was not ther. So i can not set the remote. I will neverorder from you again.,1,0,181
A2SKR9O60ZE62D,1,This is absolutely the best 36u0026quot TV with the best Picture Tube for the buck. It doesnt have all the tons of useless features. more so it has all the Quality Picture features.. I know youll be impressed..,5,1,210
A2SKR9O60ZE62D,44,This is the best camera I have seen for the price. It has tons of features. I would highly recommend getting a Compact Flash Card Reader. so you dont drain your batteries on the camera xfering. Also the Kodak Batteries are the best I have ever used. I would recommended getting the 2 hour rapid charger kit. you will get another set of batteries and be able to charge one set and use another.,5,1,392
A2SKVCKORF8J9Y,12,I plugged this adapter into my new Dell Laptop and it brought up my CompactFlash card as an additional hard drive in Windows 2000. no software or additional drivers required.I was then able to browse and even edit pictures on the card as if it were a disk drive. Truly amazing. All peripherals should be this easy to install and intuitive to use.,5,1,346
A2SL9C3TB12J5J,4146,This is a great little player. If you have a fast internet connection like a DSL or cable modem and can download good quailty mp3s then this player produces great sound. I get a lot of my tracks from .top20mp3. as they have high quality stuff. some of the other places have skips or fuzzy bits in the files. This player is great. I wish they made a waterproof version though.,4,1,375
A2SLC1IBPQV4PS,44,I bought these tapes this past Jan. 2013 and in several weeks they started going bad. They had lines and blurring and the images were shaking when played back. I have had to throw most of them out and its only March. I feel as though I wasted my money.,1,0,252
A2SLS2NDPLQYP,0,It is not thin and light.  You can put it in your camera bag. so it is very portable.The pictures from my camera look awesome on my big tv.I am hesitant to give it 5 stars. because the first time I tried using it. it did not work.I had to pull it in and out of the camera a few time for it to actually work.,4,1,307
A2SM28JXD0Q3H8,0,I really love moleskin. have several journals.notebooks. of the regular type.  But I have to agree with other reviewers. until they have one set up for right handers. this item would not be very convenient.  I LOVE the idea!  Just looking at the pictures. it would be awkward to read and take notes as a right hander. obviously this was developed by a lefty. no a criticism. just an observation.,3,0,395
A2SNCAJ5HJ57NP,48,It has been great. Bought this for my daughter for christmas and believe me she has given it the work out!!! The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star is the darn head set. But all in all this is the best value for the money.,4,1,236
A2SNY7XYIFGP54,33,When I first received my Rio it was very frustrating. The Software istall CD was broken.  I EMailed Rio to see what to do. they directed me to the site where to download the software simple enough. Well now I had a new  problem. the player installed itself to the wrong place in the hard drive  making itself undetectable to the Audio Manager.  Well anyways. it took two  days but it was worth it. I give the Rio500 4 stars because the technical  staff at Rio was very helpful and now that it is working it is excellent.  Some people complain that the volume should go higher. its lower than the  others. but fine none of the less.,4,1,631
A2SNYDWPE3AMMF,0,I bought an USD80 camera to start off with and the resolution was sooo bad that i returned it. I thought that i would never but a digital camera again. I found this one. read a few reviews and decided it couldnt hurt to try it out. Well the one and only picture i could take with the batteries  that they sent me was awsome.  The only 2 things i would sugjest purchasing  with this camera would be 8 nickel metal hydride batteries.which are  rechargable. so get a recharger also. and buy at least a 16 meg  compactflash card so you can take more then 12 good pictures before  downloading. Once you get these goods the camera really rock n rolls.,4,1,645

A2SOKOONUQ850N,0,The usb charger socket was totally broken and never worked. Im not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either. It was difficult to fit grounded US plugs in without some serious shoving. and the fakey plastic ground doesnt retract so I couldnt use it on outlets that didnt have a ground socket .common in Hong Kong.. Its also quite big and heavy to travel with.,2,0,416

A2SPHO9F2ZL98F,0,These CD or DVD wipes are good for removing surface lint or smudges on Disks but dont expect them to remove serious glitches or hang ups. They are dry thats the first hing so they cant really be expected to remove any ingrained glitches but cetainly for the maintenance of disks and keeping them dust free these are very good. I was looking for somthing that would really help to illiminate some hang ups and getting stuck type glitches that I had so in fact I ended up just buying a new DVD of the same recording...but its a good product for maintenance. I guess the lesson I learnt is not to leave the disk in the player when not being used. Also the method to wipe off a disk is so important not to use a circular motion say like you would on an old LP recording..so I did in fact also learn something from the instructions as well.,4,1,835
A2SR1HWC9A2ST6,0,This bag is a bit bigger than I thought.  The inside is foamy with firm paddings to protect my ... G2 camera.  But. I can really fit two G2.s. in the bag.  It does feel like a small little girls backpack for me.  I dont know if this is good or bad.  The right side has a zipper to store your cables and wires.  The back side has another zipper to store your pensmemory card.  Yet the inside was large enough for me to put my digital camcorder Sony TRV17 in there.  Take in mind that my Canon G2 is much much smaller than the Sony TRV17.  But it can fit well if I store my battery chargers and cables inside and put the camera on top.  But then I really dont want to scratch it.  Thats the whole purpose of me buying this bag.  Now. I will have to think of something to pad the inside down to a smaller space.  With the straps. I really feel like Im wearing a purse for a guy.  Without the straps. holding it upright. I feel like Im carrying a purse.  And I really dont want people to snatch my ... purse away ...,3,0,1012

A2STLT852H9K75,0,I bought these speakers to complement my MacintoshLinux machine. For my purposes .watching DVDs. listening to MP3s. and general fooling around.. they are perfect. The price is simply unreal for the quality these speakers  have.Look elsewhere for speakers to replace your stereo. however. These  are THIRTY WATT speakers. You arent going to find punchy bass for the likes  of hiphop. rap. and other bassheavy music.These speakers provide rich.  clear sound at normal to loudish levels .fills my house!..I would give  them a 4.5 out of five stars. but I wasnt able to.

A2SU6CA6HSK85I,4,A wonderful product.  Eleven hours of battery life. a robust slotin design. and the sound quality of discs I record with it is better than my Sony Discman playing the original CD.The only downside of this unit is  the headphones  the ones you get with it are about as good as youd expect  if you bought them for USD2 at a flea market. Youll need to buy another  pair. and theyll need to be the same ultrasensitive kind you need for  newer Sony MiniDisc recorders otherwise youll need some sort of addon  headphone amp. like the Boostaroo.I really wish Sharp had given the  output stage a bit more power. so it could drive a normal pair of  headphones.  If theyd done that and put in a pair worth more than USD2. Id  have given the unit five stars.,4,1,747

A2SYNDZSH73SFG,0,As the package says.u0026quotbasic mouseu0026quot. This is a great mouse if all you need is to click here and there. and get you pointer to move across your screen.

A2T049UQONS0OY,0,I have used this camera since the late 1990s for mostly professional purposes. I write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs andor to accompany job announcements. often with almost no prior notice.Of all the cameras I looked at in the 1990s. this was the one that best suited my needs. The reasons for that follow.1. Shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my PC.2. The 10X zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when I could not get close to my subject.3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder. a large left hand grip. and big button to press when shooting pictures.Before I bought this camera. I worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work I do now. In all those years I never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one. nor did I use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to efile was easier.Having said that. this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results. It is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events.But Ive taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes. and I took some pictures of the Christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree.So dont buy this to create awardwinning photography. For all the same reasons. it doesnt produce very good hardcopy photos.But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. Thats my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.In addition. the battery charger works fast and Ive never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a halfdecade of use. I dont know how this stacks up in the camera industry but its a lot better than most of the electronic equipment I use in the office or at home.,4,1,2067
A2T19GOEFTO7E1,1414,My Hutton Envelope arrived on time and in good shape. I got a new Nook HD and wanted a cover to really protect it when not in use. This works perfectly u0026 the only place I could find one was on Amazon.Thanks Amazon ..,4,1,220
A2T1PEYMVMZWQ8,0,I had the same problem as everyone else.  The product didnt work with my Garmin Nuvi 1490T.  When I plugged the unit into the charger. it would go into the loop rebooting and wouldnt charge the Nuvi.  When the Nuvi was plugged into the auto charger which came with the Nuvi. it worked fine.  Its a waste of money. cant believe Amazon recommended it.  Ive been so happy with everything else Ive ordered from Amazon and their customer service.  Now its too late to get my money back. I guess a 30 day return policy should have alerted me to the quality of the product.,1,0,566
A2T1UU92J5C1DR,0,I originally brought this camera to take pictures of my artist teddy bears so I could put photos of them online for customers. For this purpose. the Sony MVCFD73 is perfect  handy zoom. great battery life. easy to hold. lots of neat little picture adjustment features. However ... as soon as I started having photos printed from this camera. I was hugely disappointed. The resolution simply is not good enough. The pictures are grainy and pixelized. If you want a digital camera for online work only. this baby will do great. But for your photo album. youd be adviced to look elsewhere.,4,1,586

A2T3QEL0VGSBVG,2,If youre looking for something that can digitize video onto your computer. this is definetly the product for you.  Not to mention the added bonus of being able to watch TV on your PC.  The TV Tuner works great just  like an ordinary TV.  Just plug in a cable cord and youre ready to go.  The picture quality is great. and you can view in a window of any size. or  make it full screen.  It comes with a program that lets you add all sorts  of nifty features to your own videos. like titles. background music. and  you can edit the scenes in any order.  Installation is reasonably easy.  even for a 15 year old like me. who gets no help from his computer  illiterate parents.  This product is worth double the price advertised.,5,1,725

A2T6NGTWIK2I9A,2,My Palm IIIx is truely one of the most enjoyable devices that I have ever owned. Boredom has become a thing of the past.  I have two whole novels stored in my Palms memory. There is ample room for five more.  I actually  look forward to waiting in long lines. The back lighted screen makes  reading in the dark a very enjoyable activity.  The term u0026quotUser  Friendlyu0026quot is an under statement when describing the Palms operating  system.  I wish that I had know about this little computer years earlier.  3Com or Palm has definitely won another loyal fan.,5,1,565
A2T7CFOC41LDPX,1515,The battery came with its instructions for use. it is working good and my Palm M515 is alive again. but the seller must send more information about what is happening with the product.  They have no communication with me.,5,1,220

A2TEUH7IBT0TS8,11,As soon as I fired up the KLH PSW81008 sub. I was impressed.  For the small price and small size. it pumps out loads of bass!  At moderate volumes the bass is clean and loud.  When played at very high volumes the  u0026quottightnessu0026quot or transient response was degraded. however.  Also  the sub could produce almost no material under 50 Hz. which is still better  than any other sub in the same price range that can produce the shear  output of this one.  For cheap. loud. clean. and fairly deep bass. this is  an excelent solution.,4,1,539
A2TFW2UWCNZ79A,2626,It has not worked  ever.  When I plug it in it installs a driver.  Submitted a ticket to Sabrent support.  They had me uninstall the driver and install another one.

A2TGUBBF20BO7J,0,Ive just bought the PCTV and have noticed some bugs in the software. You can watch TV just fine with the card. but the included Studio software will not run on my system without crashing. I havent been able to capture a  single clip since buying this card. Im a systems tech.. so I have some  idea how to troubleshoot PC problems. but after checking out Pinnacles  msg. boards. Im no closer to figuring out whats wrong. There may be a  problem with DirectX 7.0. A coworker who has almost an identical system  .except he has DirectX 6.1. has no problem at all.  This rings true for  most of the people on the msg. boards. also.  I bought this card mainly to  watch TV on my PC. so the capture problems dont affect me too greatly. but  if youre buying this card to primarily capture video. be aware you might  run into some problems.,3,0,831
A2TINWB1R15RNC,9092,discover does exactly what it is designed to do.used in conjunction with an anti glare screen protector. this is an ideal case. The only minor flaw that I have found with it is that the hand strap is located in the very center of the case and I think it would be a slightly better designed to have the hand strap off sooner because the Kindle 8.9 is too large for most womens hands to be able to use the strap located where it is. For men this probably isnt a problem but then most man probably wouldnt be ordering the powder blue case either. All in all it is a good product especially considering the price and I would definitely re buy this product or buy another one just like it,4,1,683

A2TKIP5T3QM099,11,Ive just a bought a psion 5 from ebay a few weeks ago and would like to add my 2 cents.Im surprised that its 2006 and this 10 year old computer was the only one that was capable of doing what i needed and more. it actually surpasses all of my expectations. For 20 pounds .the guy i bought it from actually lives in my city so i saved 8 pounds on the postage. I have a minature laptop with a great keyboard and instant functionality. I just switch on and the document that i was typing is there ...its like opening a book . only you dont have to look or the page so its actually easier. I havnt got it synched to my pc yet because i need a usb to serial adaptor which should set me back 7 pounds . but once i do i can easily copy books over . so ill have a book reader in there too.currently i have a psp which has lots of homebrew  on it such as bookr on which you can read books . and pep . which i use to read comics . but unfotunately there no keyboard . which is a shame because then i would have had eveythign i needed in one little device . games . books. comics. pdfs movies . music ........what a device. god bless homebrew . but this is the best text input device i could hyave hoped for. cheap . lasts ages with a battery. the guy gave me rechargables so i dont ecven have to mess with the back up battery . but theyre like a quid . and the screen is great. even better infact outdoors .soemthign that annoys me with the psp . its practically unusable outdoors.I can believe people buy those small pdas. but i gues they dont want to do any serious typing..seriously..its 2006 and if you want soemthing that u can take anywhere . itll fit in my jeans ....heck u can take it on holiday and never have to recharge it  till u get back home!!! ....hows that for portabilty...forget the laptops. till the umpcs become more user friendly ....and get this little gadget...its brilliant.,5,1,1888
A2TMIW0AU6RR6J,33,I shouldnt be complaining since this cost almost nothing but my main intent in using this was to record lectures with no significant static.

A2TTLTI9NMFKER,0,Im someone who has never owned a tablet before or anything similar. I am used to hard copy books and not ebooks. In fact I dislike reading ebooks on computer having tried a few times. Regardless I purchased this Nook tablet for reading and found it to be enjoyable and have read and finished a few books though I only owned it for about a week. Its comfortable in your hand though youll have to find the right balance for yourself. Also. it is easy to use since Im bad with technology and has smooth and fast reactions. as well as easy to turn the page.Reading however was not my only objective. if it was the ereader would be great too and much cheaper but I wanted to use this as an organizer. entertainment. and just for mundane things. The Netflix. browsing. and games are great. The volume is a little low but putting on headphones solves the problem or a quiet area. Organizers are fine as long as you find the right app.The batteries however are lacking in my opinion since I use it to read or entertainment for long periods of time I have to charge the battery daily or at maximum in two days. I think I watched something on Netflix for about 20 minutes and drained almost 5% on my batteries or a little less than that. Another troublesome thing is that at times the browser or app Im using force closes. Though it doesnt happen too often I get irritated easily. Also. the screen smudges very easily you would probably want to get a screen protector for that if nothing else.Conclusion.Great product without the apple price.Suggestions.Dont purchase the cover or antiglare from Barnes and Noble store its really expensive and Amazon is cheaper.,4,1,1652
A2TTYDHMMIY6EM,3133,The reader is great except you cant use it until you register it. Went to the library and couldnt get on their wifi to do it. Nor could I use macdonalds where they have the atu0026t hotspot they promised would work. The nook wouldnt let me do it anywhere but a Barnes and Nobles store so I didnt get to use it for almost 2 weeks. Then I made my first purchase of an ebook...1 book...and they double charged me. once through barnesandnoble.com and again through barnesandnoblemarketplace. They appoligized but wouldnt be putting the money back for 5 days. Since this was cash money they took off my debit card I was just out for days...wonder what would have happened if Id bought 10 books? The nook seems to work great now that I can use it. but using barnes and noble for you ebooks might not be the best idea. They admitted they were having a problem with the double dipping and were trying to fix it. I had it happen 2 years ago when I ordered on line to have paper backs sent to me. So it hasnt been fixed in 2 years.. But I like the nook!,3,0,1043

A2TXTCIOBK1NMQ,11,I am unsure of the benefit of using this CD lens cleaner.  It MAY have solved the problem of a dirtydusty lens. but it may not have. as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved.  Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all. and on all of my players that did. it could not advance to the third track. which contains only music.  Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players. including those that never skip on other discs.  If nothing else. this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix. but if your CD players lens needs cleaning. there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.,2,0,675

I didnt expect best performence when I bought it at its price. but I certainly didnt expect it would be that BAD! When a person with a pair of glasses wear the EarHugger. he or she wouldnt be able to use it without having to constantly adjust its position around the ear because it doesnt stay fixed longer than 5 minutes. Unless you really like the price. I recommend you not to buy this...EarHugger. especially if you wear glasses.,1,0,675
A2TYS4XW255Y8Y,67,This part said it would fit my galaxy tab 7inch and it doesnt!!! Waste of money. dont bother ordering this!,1,0,107
A2TZIDVCTQGZ0P,55,I threw these headphones out 2 days after I bought them. They are made to fit a person with a very large head. thus they dont sit snug on your ears. I tried to use them while jogging and they would slide down because they are not tight around your head and the raised cushion makes it worse. I have had other headphones like this that never had that problem while I exercised. See the raised cushion part on the speaker. the fabric easily rips and separates from the speaker casing. leaving you with raw plastic against your ear. Also. the black fabric on the center of the speaker is very thin and is glued to the plastic.These headphones are a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere for a better product.,1,0,707
A2U0ZD08F7EJ87,11,I have a ipod touch i bought this item before i realized that my ipod already has a built in mic and so havent used this mic and never needed it.,3,0,145
A2U27A197AH87W,0,For the super cheap price. its a great hand held to have as a back up.  Kind of hard to use. and seems to be a little iffy. but again. I got it as a good backup...,3,0,163
A2U2B8A7B4I8KZ,0,It ok for the price. It retracts well. The tip has a tendency to unscrew itself though. While using it on a 2 week road trip. I pulled it out of the lighter socket and the tip fell back into the socket and blew the fuse. Now I check it each time I use it. It also makes your Garmin think its plugged into a computer. so you have a long wait before it realizes theres no computer attached to it. The adapter that comes with a Garmin is wired correctly to avoid this. but doesnt store as nicely in your glovebox. The retractable wire looks very delicate. so you have to treat it gently.,3,0,584
A2U3DWEMPZGHEW,0,The pictures dont seem to be as good as they should be.  The cameria uses batteries quickly. and the flash is inadaquate. The software is simple. the uploading of pictures is efficient. but if it doesnt work. there arent many diagnostics. But for .the cost. what do you expect? I think just a little bit more.,2,0,309
A2U4W69NZJT4LD,44,Its difficult to write a specific review for this product.  It either works or it dont.  It works.  Thats what I want it to do.,5,0,127
A2U60CKGI5I1XN,22,I love to read.  So I was skeptical about receiving a Nook as a gift.  To my surprise I got use to it fairly fast.  But Im going back to real books.  Ive had this Nook two months. have gone to the Barnes and Noble store two times over technical issues. called technical support at least 4 times.  Ive lost a book I had bought over a month ago. Ive had the time keep getting off track. Ive had it freeze. Ive had to unregister and reregister. its failed to upgrade automatically.  I finally asked for a new replacement and I want did they send me?????  A preowned Nook which they never explained to me at the time I had to demand a replacment.  Never was one offered to me.  If I had owned my Nook a year or so I may have understood the need for a preowned Nook but Ive had trouble with a new Nook from the first week and deserve a new Nook replacement.  Im going back to real books.  I love the way they feel. they dont break down. no one talks back to me. lies or tries to deceive me.  I dont have to worry about the time. upgrades. and I can buy used ones much much cheaper.  Why mess with a good thing?,1,0,1105
A2U704IT9ZAPJG,47,Very unique for speakers that are apart of the cheaper line. The only problem is occasionally the wired need to be twisted to hear full sound. A unique feature to them is that they can run off of batteries!,4,1,206
A2U7TBN6ZZLWSK,0,This product was exactly what I have been searching for in an iPad mini case. Many people also ask where they can get one!,5,0,122
A2U7TF9SVGJZ41,23,Now available in Japan are the EZ1s bigger brothers VN EZ3 and VNEZ5. Both are substantial upgrades! I own and all 3 and must say that each evolutionary step is incredible. I am not sure if the later models have made it out of Japan yet. so the down side is that the manuals and screen prompts are in Japanese. However. there is an English translation of the manual available from Sharp so there is hope for those of you who cant wait another year .or more?. until the upgrades are available in North America or Europe. ....,4,1,524
A2U851X3M1Q3HD,33,It is regular headphone with special plugin for Yamaha keyboard. but can also plug into cell phone. computer...etc. The sound is the same as wo headphone. It is convenient when your neighbor is not far away.,5,1,207
A2U9PSBO4X4ZXW,33,I have gone through both the SD3109 and the 4109X and both were a complete disappointment.  Both the 4109Xs that I tested along with the SD3109 were inconsistant in play.  Problems included excessive loadup  times. scrambled picturesinterface. locking up and in some cases never  being able to play questionable condition DVDs.  The same questionable  DVDs played just fine on all Sony DVD players I tested with no  problems  and no delays at all.Other annoyances included noisy tray eject  mechanism and excessively slow and noisy carousel motor.I opted for  Toshiba in the first place because I have had great experiences with their  TVs and VCRs.  However. their DVD line leaves much to be desired.,1,0,701
A2U9RZNVN4IDOB,2631,After purchasing 2 of the 8 gig Snow HD tablets at the 130 price point. I can totally arrest to the power and beauty of this tablet.Fast. gorgeous display. super responsive display. great sound quaity and volume. and more than powerful enough to run any app!You absolutely cannot get a better android tablet. until you get into the 400 dollar and up range.The Google Play integration is what really makes this a totally unbeatable tablet.And the lifetime FREE support from Barnes and Noble is epic.Want stock android? N2A . Com has SD cards you just pop in. and it runs the latest version of Google Android! WITHOUT ROOT!,5,1,621
A2U9UL88VXBMJ4,0,This is a great little camera. A real bargain at this price. Excellent color and quality pictures. Only drawback is slow serial interface to computer. Buy a Flashpath floppy adapter or a memory card reader to  transfer pictures faster. A good card reader that wont crash your system  is made by SIIG. They call it their USB DigiFilmCombo Reader. About USD79  street price. Also get the MAHA charger and NIMH batteries reviewed  elsewhere on this page.,5,1,451
A2UAG5QQ8W8UDJ,3030,I really like my new GoType keyboard. but I was a little disappointed when I found out that it didnt arrive with the TakeNote word processor and WordSleuth thesaurus that is supposed to be included when you buy the keyboard.  Its promised in the advertising about the GoType on the Amazon.com site.  What gives. Amazon?Other than that. it works like a charm.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to do extensive word processing or other similar data entry on the run.  I do lots of document editing while Im away from my computer. and this makes it all possible.  It almost makes your Palm a replacement for a notebook computer. which is a nice capability. ..,4,1,665
A2UBHMRIC81KBO,55,First off let me just say that I had never owned a cb radio before. Anyway having said that. let me tell you its a good radio and useful too. where I live .Los Angeles County. California. USA. I am able to hear NOAA stations for two other counties. other than my own. as well as the LAMTA light rail system. perfect for avoiding crossings with trouble or for knowing delays if you are a passenger. As far as distance in urban city areas goes handheld to handheld I got 1 and 12 blocks. using a cheap USD15 magnet antenna from walmart I was able to transmit 1.2 miles from my car in motion to a handheld in my apartment.,4,1,619
A2UBYUXL04J920,11,i love the fact that it has 4 buttons and you can program u0026quotbutton chordsu0026quot to do stuff. eg. if you press the top two buttons. the current window will minimize.  it offers a lot of useful shortcuts allowing you easier access to the taskbar. cutpaste. common keystrokes or your own list  of favourite applications.on the downside is the trackball shape  it is not made with the shape of your hand in mind as it is curved up at  end so you cant relax your fingers properly.also. the NT support isnt  up to snuff.  i demolished my system when i installed a new driver  overtop  of the old one .take it from me  make sure you UNINSTALL the old one  first!. the technical support people were not helpful or sympathetic with  my plight so you may notice some lingering bitterness in this review.,3,0,803
A2UC1G6JLLNE18,1414,Not only does this item not work. it actually made the reception WORSE!!! I disconnected it and reconnected it. changed cables. toggled the switches on the device itself. basically tried everything I could to get an improvement but the ONE channel I was trying to get a modest improvement on. went from a 2030% signal to ZERO. and the other channels dropped from 7080% to around 50%. This will be my LAST product from Emerson.,1,0,426
A2UC38DO8AQFWD,12,My wife loves her Nook. It has her back to reading. She downloads books from the library with ease. She especially likes the fact it brings her back to the same spot she stopped.,5,0,178
A2UCS79CVYERA,22,For a present. I recently got an RCA RP7968 Boombox. Its really great! The RCA has large. easy to use. readable buttons. It plays CDs and cassettes with ease. and it also is very stylish.not as much as some Sonys and Aiwas. though.. Although. there are few downsides. First off. it really is not for portable use. It eats away batterys in no time. In addition. it is pretty heavy for a boombox. I still do reccomment this RCA boombox...as I said in my title it has a great value and great quality. but if you spend a few bucks more. you might be able to find a better one for your needs.,4,1,587
A2UD04EUYRC7MM,1010,I looked around at cheaper shower radios and also looked at the highend offerings. This was the perfect price point of top quality. Ive owned this radio for over a year and it is just such a part of my daily routine that I would really miss it if it were gone. Set your favorite stations on one band and set another persons favorites on another. Choose to listen to an early AM talk show or get traffic or just anything to get your brain going. Anyhow....this radio has performed flawlessly. I cant think of reception issues and it is plenty loud and easy to read. It is not a battery hog. Im very satisfied..........Thats what I wrote a year ago. but the radio recently stopped powering on. After looking over the battery power and other possibilities I concluded that the power on button has failed. In fact. I read someplace that this was an issue for another owner of this model. I guess I got my moneys worth out of it. but Im moving up to the Sangean with a little of my Christmas bonus I earned this year..,3,0,1013

A2UDBHS7MZP06L,0,Wow this is a real piece of junk if you have any other wireless devices going on in the home.  And who nowadays doesnt?  There is so much noise you cant even hear yourself think.  Oh well lesson learned.  If I could have given this device a zero I would have.,1,0,259
A2UDOLIDBH50TO,0,I have found my Palm V to augment my daily life and help organize a very hectic schedule.  However. the unit broke after three months and trying to get support is like pulling teeth.  They do a good job of marketing and a  lousy job of custmer satisfaction.  Looks like I will take my business  elsewhere in the future.  I feel like I am dealing with a group of snake  oil salesmen!,3,0,382
A2UEW04N38LVB,6876,This is a great large trackball that was discontinued after a few years by Logitech.It is however. very much a vintage collectible  still functional as a trackball  but not current cuttingedge technology.THE REVIEWS START IN 1999. PEOPLE.*  Theres no way Logitech will provide a Windows 7 driver for this.Still many users believe this is one of the best trackballs ever made. comparable perhaps to theMicrosoft Trackball Explorer also no longer made.  A new MSTE one will set you back hundreds theyre scarce.*Amazon says they first stocked this in 1973? What is that. 22 years before Amazon launched? Wasnt the web called ARPANET then?,5,1,635
A2UFFOLHYEJBB7,33,I got this flash drive for my car which has a USB port. I wanted something pretty and in one piece. This is a pretty piece but the swivel on this is too loose. I wanted to put it in the port and have it stand straight. Sadly. it swivels and the visual effect is not what I hoped. Other than that it is a flash drive like any other and I have no technical problems.,3,0,364
A2UFWAR4444F1K,33,I really wanted a ereader but they all seemed to cost way to much. This one works really well and was very affordable.,5,0,118
A2UGCTTQKIVX9H,13,Nook Color and cord arrived quickly. wrapped in a layer of bubble wrap in a mailing envelope.  It has a small. variable Delamination in the  upper left corner that is not objectionable.  However. the Nook end of the special charging USB cord was cracked and variable in its connection as well.After four days of intermittent operation  the charging cable failed completely and the Nook discharged overnight.  I bought a new cable from Bu0026N. hooked it up. and all is well.Considering the price of the charging cable and the new Nooks. the price was almost a wash.I do like the Nook Color. but wish it had arrived in better shape.,3,0,631
A2UGFX4POH7NAL,24,Battery charged quickly and installed in my camera very easily. A great replacement option for the original battery and much less expensive.,5,0,140
A2UIFGA3R5IO2V,0,I would have given this a 5 star rating. but it came without instructions and there were parts missing. The part is that once I figured it out. I didnt need the missing parts. and it works like a charm.,4,1,202
A2UIXYI0AQ8O8L,0,These little speakers are remarkably good value.  Couldnt be easier to use and long battery life.  Only drawback is that they dont recharge your ipod.  But a real bargain with good sound for the money.,4,1,201
A2UJBOBEIK2YFR,0,Most people that have bad things to say about Nook are those who bought it to be an I pad or another tablet.  Though it has tablet features this isnt supposed to be a tablet.  If thats what youre for go elsewhere.  I bought the + with 32 cause I like nook comics as well as e books. The comics look awesome on the larger screen my last nook which was the nook color only 7 to the hd+s 9 inch screen.  Iike the tabletop feature where by just holding somewhere on screen you can access your most recent books. apps etc...  I have noticed the screen gets dirty quickly so I suggest a screen protector for it and just a lens cloth like for glasses to clean it.,5,1,656
A2UKYRETZU904O,23,All BROTHER labeling  tapes are good quality and great for their purpose. However this tape was overpriced. and in fact most brother tapes are priced too high. Still. the best price I could find was at AMAZON. and the best labeling system is BROTHER.,5,1,250
A2UNPQIED8UO2O,0,This lightweight headset does the job. and the price is right. Its held up well for 4 months of daily use. The fact that it lightly hangs on the ear rather than fitting snugly took a couple days to get used to. but its nice that it is so light.,4,1,244
A2UOZQUN8CE4CN,33,This camcorder is fantatic in all that it does. Light and surprising clarity of output. The only disadvantage is that you only get a 30 minute battery and 30 minute video cassette. Having to stop and charge your  battery every thirty minutes could tend to be a bothersome bore. I have  called to get another battery but RCA dont sell any batteries past 30  minutes. Other then that. The cam is easy to use and you can put video  characters while you are recording.,4,1,464

A2URFPDDQ8MSUE,0,I think this is going to work I had in my sons phone. He has lots of lots of games . he also has a lot of pictures . this will help him save a lot of space on iphone .,4,1,167
A2USLUJ69XNNAK,0,The earphones seemed decent enough when they first came out of the package. However upon closer inspection. I realized .too late. that you cant separate the earphones from the autowinder device. So if you want to  walk around with these. expect to have a rather large plastic lump hanging  from the wires.The sound is decent however the treble output is poor.  Im a treble person and I found the bass way too strong. On the other hand.  if you like bass this might be a good thing.  They dont even have lables  on the earphones to indicate which is the left and right bud. All in all. I  say youre probably better off buying ANY other earphones.,1,0,645
A2UT9JA2RM0TMC,1314,I wanted to add fast 3D to a machine that had a good 2D card .TV tuner. video capture. etc.. I didnt want to remove.  The Voodoo2 card did the trick...sort of.  It works great and Quake3 and other games look  great.The only problem stems from the fact that you have to feed the  output of the 2D card into this card. If Im in 3D mode and something makes  Windows flip back to 2D mode .game crashes. window pops up. etc... the 3D  card almost never switches back to letting the 2D video through.All I  have to do it move the video cable back and forth between the video cards  to work around this. but it is annoying.  The latest drivers from 3dfx  dont seem to help with this at all.The good news is that Quake3  almost never crashes and the card looks great at 800x600 .you can add a  second identical card and chain them together to run higher resolutions.  which I might try..,4,1,879
A2UTGOO5VG4SQN,88,This is a great product. buy some enerloop brand rechargeable AA batteries and you are all set. Still havent tried with a car mounted antenna yet. but this is a great portable CB.Sanyo Eneloop AA NiMH PreCharged Rechargeable Batteries  8 Pack,5,1,242

A2UU42Q09CWT24,0,Most people dont realize that the best thing about the Olympus C2000 is that its zoom lens goes from an aperature of f2.0 to an aperature of f2.8.Most people dont even know what an aperature is or why a 2.02.8 range  is good. So if youre like most people then let me explain.A lens that  has a 2.0 rating lets in more than twice as much light as a lens with a 3.5  rating. like the Nikon CoolPix 950. Therefore. if you are indoors. and you  want to take a picture without a flash .which is highly recommended to  preserve naturallooking colors instead of washed out pictures of people  with red eyes.. then the Olympus C2000 is definitely the best camera.Also. the C2000s form factor is better than Nikon or anybody else. The  camera is small and light. and feels wellmade as you hold it. The Nikon  however feels flimsy and the zoom responds slower. The Nikon is in two  pieces as well. connected by a swivel joint. That seems more likely to  break. and I dont see why having a swivel joint is important or  useful.Overall. in my two years of working at a camera store. the C2000  is the first digital camera to deserve true merit. Its well priced and has  image quality comparable to models costing ten times as much. Also the lens  is a high quality aspherical Olympus element. I wouldnt recommend anything  else.jonathan s gilbert,5,1,1334
A2UUNC4CW16062,3232,This mount is very sturdy. assembled easily. and had all the parts to attach to the wall securely. While the monitor turns easily from side to side. I wish the adjustment for tilting the monitor up and down did not require a nut be loosened first.,3,0,247

A2UW26LS3CO92P,0,These headphones are one of the worst purchases I ever made. They look cheap. feel cheap. as if theyre about to fall apart. The sound quality fades and gets staticy when my laptop moves. Sometimes you can even here  the lowest level of static when the laptop is not moving. Its extremely  annoying. Additionally. the headphones have terrible staticy base. and  horrendous treble as well. Youre better off with a 2.50USD set of headphones  that fit in your ear. if you want to be cheap. or if you want wrap around  headphones. get something else. This has got to be one of the worst  purchases Ive made in the last year.,1,0,619

A2UX12JF2RTETG,912,This lock is absolutely a piece of crap. The lock reset after a few uses and was stuck in my computer. When I called the company. this is what they emailed me.SUGGESTION 1.  Manual DecodingStart with 0000 and sequentially enter combinations until you find the proper combination.  Remember to press the silver button after each number change.  On average. it takes about 45 minutes to discover the code.  While manual decoding may seem to be a time consuming option. it prevents damage to the notebook and allows the user to continue to use the DEFCON CL.SUGGESTION 2.  Sawing off the DEFCON CLUsing a hacksaw with a metal cutting blade. saw through the plastic head and metal post as shown in the picture below.  You can then unscrew the portion of the metal post that remains in your computer.I cut the cable with wire cables to make it portable again and then started at 0000. I finally stumbled upon my code. This lock is crap as is Targuss costumer service.,1,0,962
A2UXEHOVQGL4HJ,0,The D340R is a great camera for the time it was created and marketed.  Granted. it uses a serial port. but that was the standard a few years ago.  I bought a multicard reader. no problem with downloads now!It does use batteries. but only if you are foolish enough to try to run the LCD display window a lot.I bought a quick charger and a couple of sets of rechargeables at Radio Shack. and have had no problem.The controls are useable. although Ive never been able to make the u0026quotDelete Allu0026quot function work. it involves pressing two buttons at once.To noevilpeople. it DOES have a telephoto function. if you want a zoom. spend the money.Its rugged enough  I dropped it from a picnic table to the ground once with no ill effect.Again. this is an older camera. newer digitals offer more features.  I bought mine in 1999. that was dogs years ago in the electronic world!Ive used an Olympus camera for film. now this D340R. when I upgrade to a newer digital. Ill get another Olympus digital camera.,4,1,1007
A2UXSZODEVWL4K,2,I have to admit that this is a very good VCR in the case of dupilicating tapes.  However. this VCR comes with WAY too many features that makes the operations relatively .actually. unneccessarily. difficult.  Taping from  tape to tape is very easy and the result is very sharp. however. taping  from TV doesnt seem that well.  The picture sometimes shakes even I tape  on a brand new tape .I know it is not tracking problem..  However. it is  not a bad VCR at all. especially a Dual Deck Super VHS at this value.,4,1,511
A2UY0KICDHKM1N,33,They cost about the same and use similar eInk technology. They are basically quite similar devices.My primary use is going to be reading product manuals and datasheets that are as a matter of unwrittenrule in the PDF format. My secondary use would be reading ePub books. I have a large collection.The reason chose the Nook Touch over the Kindle were.+ support for open ePub format.+ expandable storage with SD card slot+ touch works better than Kindles keyboard+ I can root the Nook and install a proper browserSure. there are minus points for Nook too. Amazon has many many more bestsellers and newspapers last time I checked.This does not really matter to me. No option for 3G. I would have got a Nook Touch 3G were it available. No media player or audiobook support in the Nook Touch.EDIT.1. After using the Nook for .almost. one one year. and probably 50.000 pages on the Nook. I am convinced that ebooks are the way forward. Ebooks reduce paper consumptions and save trees. Governments should subsidize ebooks if publishers dont bring down the prices. It is a shame that the price difference between a printed book and its Kindle copy is hardly USD 2. Is that the benefit of trying to save the planet?2. Those of you who read IEEE papers on their ebook readers may find the free program K2pdfopt from willus.com very useful.3. The only thing I miss on all the current generation ebook readers is the ability to take notes on the margins. I tried using the cell phone for that but came back to notepaper and pencils. Stylus support .like the Samsung Galaxy Note.. handwriting recognition and voice recording should definitely be on the planning board.,4,1,1655
A2UZAUQCOYTHN7,2833,Really like the color coded outlets and color tags that are part of this unit.  Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the  pilot  lights are very bright in a darkened bedroom but a little duct tape over the lights makes it bearable.,4,1,243
A2UZHNLJG0GZ16,0,This product is great.  Plug it in and you get a phone jack wherever you want.  I recently had a direct tv receiver moved to another room where there was no phone jack. You just pop this in the wall outlet and plug it into your TV. Easy to use.,5,1,244

A2V150D7MAQS3Q,33,I had none of the problems described in some of the reviews. although the frame grabbing tool wouldnt work consistently.  I am happy to say that  Pinnacle fixed this issue and others with release 1.05. which you can  download as a patch from their website.  With this issue resolved. I can  say that this product is quite a bargain and has helped me create simple.  highquality videos very easily.  HOWEVER. firewire video editing only  works well when you have plenty of RAM .128mb seems about right. and a fast  hard disk .most newer UDMAs work just fine..,5,1,558
A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,1313,This is not a review of the product but I thought this information may be good to know before you order. Could save someone money and frustration.I ordered this Defcon 1 unit .~USD34. in April 2013. and received a Devcon CL .combination lock and cable ~USD21. that was improperly labled with an Amazon SKU label listed improperly as a Defcon 1 unit. It arrived in a clear plastic pack so I could see it was the wrong item. If I did not have Prime it would likely have cost me shipping. Prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund. so I was OK with this. Just FYI. if you are ordering this and paying for shipping.It looked like a good device and was recommended to lock down a ~USD300 RV voltage protector that can be stolen easily while camping. But. rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same Amazon seller. I opted to use something else.  Amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens. but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund.Be aware this is the FIRST time an Amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over 15 years of business with Amazon .I am very happy with Amazon and appreciate their costomer service.. so I just wanted to help if you pay for shipping. Sorry this is not a review but I HOPE this helps someone.,1,0,1284
A2V24K8UWPPDSB,12,This tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad. Serves more than one purpose ...while its primary function is reading. The original nook is a whole family experience. Its size and durability give the nook. nook color. and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity. This is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school. She wanted something to read her books on. and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for her.Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader .WiFi only. . Black u0026 White.,5,1,573

A2V2AGB2F9KB0N,0,The case itself is made well and sturdy. however. it doesnt allow access to the Onoff button and the volume buttons.  It does have the sleepawake function. but overall it is not user friendly.,2,0,192
A2V3S0DR8P8DFF,0,Got a nook color for comics...found out they dont read cbr or czb files so I converted to epub. but they were all black and white. Then. I figured out how to make em color but the zoom was baad and everything looked like crap and it was too hard to read. So. I got a program and had to convert every book to pdf. Then I had to get a special pdf reader that cost 4 dollars off the stupid app store. You have to use their app store for android and cant use google play. So...most of the apps I wanted in the first place cant be used. Dont buy a nook is what I am saying. I bought mine with trade in text books I found in someones trash so I cant be too upset. but they are super slow and really limited. Also apps that are free on google play cost money on there store.,2,0,767
A2V4SOR1VTGM0Q,1,I was out of town when our sub started to make its noise in the middle of the night.  My wife thought someone was in the house so she called the police who showed up. heard the noise and drew their guns before entering the movie room.  I would have only given a rating of one star however thinking back on how much excitement this piece of equipment added to our lives I gave it an extra star.This is the second time this thing has given up and Im not going through the hassle or expense of fixing it again.  The first time was covered by warrenty only after infinity made me the middle man arguing with their approved service center for 2 weeks.  Ya gotta love these warranties....  Ya well fix it. but we aint gonna make it easy on ya.,2,0,737
A2V5A2JA0FMZFO,22,I cant complain about the cost. I actually won these. so mine were free.These headphones provide hours of wireless listening throughout your house and even the surrounding outdoors.  The sound quality is ok. the low is good. the midrange is ok. but the high just sucks.  With some EQ adjustment they sound better but they always seem to have too low of a tone for my taste.  They completely cover the ears and block most outside sound which helps in noisy areas.  They are rather comfortable but due to the ear pressure after about an hour or so they become uncomfortable.Let me go over a quick Pros and Cons list.Pros. Good wireless reception. works well all around the house and even near by outdoors.  Similar range to a good cordless phone. Good low and ok midrange. Fairly lightweight for this type of device. Comes with everything you need including batteries. Easy to setup.Cons. Bad highrange. low tone. Becomes uncomfortable after a while due to the pressure of the pads. When the batteries get low the tuning may have to be adjusted some times. but not really a problem I had much.In the end I have found it a useful product to have if you like walking around your house listening to tunes from your computer or some other nonportable device.  If you want great u0026quothighsu0026quot look elsewhere. but for general listening these will provide you with a relatively cheap. average wireless solution.  For this I give the product 3 stars.,3,0,1450

A2V6LOCH90VZ65,0,Well. let me start of by the fact that no matter how handy this zip drive may be. its like buying a bagel slicer. a waste of money.  We have been shot straight into the technology age so lets make this as affordable as possible.  Before looking at a Zip drive please consider buying a CDRCDRW drive .Compact DiskRecordableCompact DiskReWritable..  Thought it may seem like a waste to use a CDR because you cant burn over the info that you have already burned on but you have to realize a couple of things.........1.You usually can find a good offer on a spindle of cds so that it averages out to only USD.50 a cd. which is way less then a zip disk!  2.CDs can hold either 650mb or 700mb which is 550600mb more then a zip disk.................................................................Now looking at this what are you going to do?  I hope that you look over how much you will be spending on this because even though this is a portable drive. they also have protable CDRCDRW drives! Good Luck. and Good Shopping!,1,0,1016
A2V6ZN9YU9ND9L,1929,The Nook itself was good. it did all I wanted it to do. For 10 months that is. then the screen just went blue and wouldnt change. Thats when I discovered how bad Nooks customer service is. Make sure you set aside several hours of your day if you need anything in the way of warranty. Nooks customer service is the best advertising for the ipad I can think of.,1,0,359
A2V72RTPT6SB70,34,I bought the IIIx last Christmas and 3Com has already upgraded it with the IIIxe and the IIIc. the major upgrades being the extra memory for the xe  and the color for the c.  However. the IIIx still stands on its own quite  well.  With 4 mb of memory. it still has lots of room for applications and  data.  It took a few weeks to get used to using a PDA. but once I did. it  has saved me time and time again as I have not once doubled booked an  appointment since having this device.  Right now its the lowest cost 3com  unit that has the upgradable OS capability. which I think is an important  feature.  If you have the USD50. you might as well move up to the xe and get  the extra 4 mb of memory. but if you dont and need a workhorse. there  isnt much the more expensive IIIxe will do that the IIIx can do just as  well.  Im sold on mine.,4,1,841
A2V7AH3XOGJTAA,66,Just wanted to say that Ive shopped around both in stores and online. and this is the best deal Ive found on Music CDs.  I have a Phillips dual Recorder. and have had NO problems with using your disks.  So. a word to  the wise. as long as they keep this good price. AMAZON.com is the place to  shop for the best price on Memorex Music CDs.,5,1,339
A2V7HKB9GKHIOP,2021,This is defenetly the best way to enjoy your music when you not at home. I got my unit 3 days ago and its very easy. In about half an hour I learned how to use it.

A2V8JUNCY9TPPW,3438,The card works quite fine for the price. Great if you only want to watch TV!  I own a Pentium I 200Mhz with a S3 Virge .2MB. graphics card and 32MB RAM. Watching TV works really nice with this setup.  WARNING . If you have Windows ME installed it wont work at all. I had Windows ME on my PC but had to downgrade it to Windows 98 for it work at all. On Win 98 there are still a few glitches though. 1. Its slow when capturing snapshots of your TV screen. it will actually do some disk paging and will get the picture but not the one you saw when you clicked the button but the one corresponding to a few seconds later. 2. It hangs when trying to capture video. ADVISE . You probably need better hardware than what I have.  BEFORE YOU BUY . Check your graphics card is supported by Pinnacle. Not all the features .such as video capture. work with all cards.,3,0,855
A2V8Q6IQ602H4O,89,This is one of the most inexpensive and inobstrusive uninterruptable power  supplies. but when there is a power outtage. it provides battery power only  for a few minutes .and maybe not even that..I found through several  power outages in my building .versus just power fluctuations like in a  thunderstorm. that if you have high wattage devices in the three UPS  sockets .the 280C has six sockets  3 UPS and the other 3 only surge  protected. that supplied power may only be 15 seconds or less. I had a  21u0026quot monitor. my CPU. and a scanner in the three UPS sockets... the  280C would start beeping. warning of power outage... I would start shutting  down and then suddenly everything switched off... no clean shut down. Since  then I have only the CPU plugged in... no problems .Im not worried about  seeing what I am doing in a power outtage. I just want my machine up  constantly since I often use it as a server..4 stars only since the  directions dont indicate that runtime is severely reduced when all three  UPS sockets are in use..I suspect wcc4 had too many devices plugged into  his 280C and a outtage hit when writing his 280C review.,4,1,1152
A2V8WQ7E1OD7XL,1111,Ive had plenty of experience with VCRs over the years. inside and out. Ive had to clean and repair plenty of them and occasionally used dry head cleaners for mild jobs. This thing is a piece of junk and doesnt clean anything. First of all. the box indicates the cleaner should be stopped after running for 20 seconds .always check the instructions for anything regardless of how experienced you are...never let ego or testosterone get in the way. guys...use a little wisdom.. The only problem is there isnt 20 seconds worth of cleaner tape on the cassette. It runs for 11 seconds and stops. Second. its not good when you place one of these .or a tape. into the machine and you hear a loud electronic sounding grinding noise. It happens whenever a tape has wrinkles in it and this thing did exactly that at the beginning each and every time I ran it through .I checked the actual tape and nothing looked out of the ordinary.. I gave up after a bit to avoid any further problems. After running it a few times. it still did not do anything with the simplest of cleaning jobs. I can crack open the case and clean the heads by hand faster than this thing.Clearly Ill be looking for an alternative or simply taking care of the problem by hand.Bottom line. useless.,1,0,1258

A2VAOMROZMN43W,3838,I purchased stated item as a set of three and recorded with one of the VHS tapes for a 1.5 hour program. Ejected the VHS tape to see how much of the tape was visible by viewing the right side window of the tape. As I pulled out the VHS tape. the actual tape was twisted and tangled. Tried to wind the tape back but the tape winder was frozen in place the tape was ruined.Am I to experience the same with the other two VHS tapes?,1,0,428
A2VB2Q9DVM2K39,11,I have had my Nook Color for about three months now and I must say it has been one of the easiest devices to root.  This is a great bargain for USD249 once you turn it into a full fledged Android tablet.  Forget about Nooky Froyo and go directly for Cyanogen mod..  You can then install the Bu0026N Nook reader app and Amazons own Kindle App .along with 1000s of other apps like Angry Birds..,5,1,392
A2VCCL3EHDHZGB,55,If you like to listen to CDs where there is no break in the music between 2 tracks. avoid this player! I like to listen to classical music. and often I will program only a few tracks. e.g.. to listen to one symphony on a CD with multiple works. The way it is designed. there is a break when switching tracks. so if youre listening to a movement that spans several tracks. you get a u0026quotskipu0026quot!If Im listening to an entire CD. it doesnt happen. but its horrible if youre listening to part of it.Ive talked to the company. and it was hard to even explain the problem to them  I guess no one there listens to classical music .or other albums with continuous music. anymore. Their only suggestion. after weeks of discussion. was to take it to a repair shop. Given what Ive read elsewhere. I suspect Ive stumbled across a design defect. not something that can be fixed.,1,0,876

A2VDVWA2TYAS4J,0,When rooted. this is an amazing device. with a powerful CPU that can be over clocked past the normal over clock speed of 1300 Mhz and way past the typical 800 Mhz speed with only less of a battery life and no other ill effects. You will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files. but when you do. this device will shine.

A2VEU4GLPJUFNP,12,firstly. this thing is sturdy! I mean i gotta 55in sony hangin from it and even when you pull it all the way out it holds great!the only thing is the bottom 2 bars of the x shaped support stick out past the bottom of the tv and are visable. it just doesnt look exactly clean but it holds up.I think this is more of a sony tv design flaw having the mounts off center. however. I cant help but think if the x bar things could  slide to varying lengths. then fasten it would make this product 5 stars.I if you want to position it a specific way you also have to use a socket to loosen it. move it. then tighten it. its not a big deal for me becuase i dont move it often enough. its not a big deal but for the price it is great!,3,0,724
A2VFSI42LUGPZ8,0,This is my first camera I have ever owned and it is the perfect machine. At first I had trouble with it. The LCD screen after two weeks of owning it went white. I called amazon.com and they were terrifc to me! They sent  another out right away and I recived it within a few days. I have had no  trouble sice with my new one. I would recomend this camera because of the  iLink. Thats the main reason I bought it. I also got a iMac DV special  addition and it works very wll with my camera. This camera is a must!,5,1,511

A2VIE9BE5WQ72A,22,This was a scam from the get go! It was advertised as a different more modern chip and as soon as I installed it. it crashed my brand new Motorola phone.

A2VIZ3GQZ0O6F6,0,The only thing I wish these had was some means to loop through. so that they could be attached securely to one end of the cable. Otherwise I just wrap one end around the cable and staple the two ends together. and now its  permanently  tethered to one end.I guess the only other downside might be that the option to purchase a single colour was not available. What if you want to have only one colour for your cables. so that they dont end up being in your partners case?  And I suppose the colours couldve been brighter.But they do look nice. and theres plenty of length to handle just about any normal length of cable being wrapped up.,4,1,637
A2VK62FD96KYVC,0,This carry case was perfect for my Kodak DC240.  It was only big enough to carry my camera. extra batteries and perhaps 3 or 4 extra flash cards.  In other words. there was no needless bulk .the padding seemed to make much of the size  but it gave necessary protection..  It was much easier to access the camera and extras than all the other bags Ive seen .due to its outer flap and inner zippered flap that both opened wide..  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the outer flap did not seal in such a fashion that sand and such could be well kept out .it was not really a problem on my Caribean vacation however..  The other point and shoot camera bags Ive seen which could handle sand better due to a zippered enclosure  also were terribly difficult to get my camera in and out of.,4,1,801
A2VKE3W4SYE9G7,1111,The 6002PRO. as indicated. is for professional installers or anyone was has slightly better than average abilities.

A2VN114OSP4P7Y,1,After researching and reviewing a number of mp3 players before making this purchase. I decided on the Diamond Rio 500. mainly for its 64megs of memory on board.A week after the purchase. I could not be more impressed.  Within 15 minutes of opening the box. I had the software and drivers installed and the first set of songs uploaded.  I also upgraded the firmware from the Rio site. which gave me several more preferences and options .equalizer. program play. backlight options. etc..A few points for consideration when purchasing. which took me days to gather and confirm.** I can get anywhere from 13 to 17 songs on the 64 megs on board.  That is more than I expected. but I will be investing in a 64 meg Smart Card .which the Rio can accept once you upgrade the firmware. to have more songs at my disposal.** The Rioport Audio Manager software .what you use to transfer songs to the player. is not great. but not nearly as bad as I had read.  It is not intuitive and does not come with directions. so its a trial and error thing.  I will try MusicMatch or Real Jukebox to see if its any easier.** The player itself comes with very weak documentation.  I suggest going to the Rio website and looking for the manual. which is slightly better.  I usually learn hardware without the book anyway. but if you are manualdependent. this may be a problem.**  Im up to about 7 hours on my first battery. including 3 transfers of songs.  This is not nearly the battery hog I expected it to be.  I have purchased lithium batteries because I read that I can get more play time off them. but Im still waiting for the first battery to die!**  The song quality is excellent. both with mp3s Ive downloaded off the web and those Ive converted from CD.  I will complain about the headphones.  Not because they mess up sound quality but because the pads keep falling off them!  They arent as comfortable as I prefer.**  I use the Rio for joggingwalking and 90 minutes of train travel to work every day.  It is small. compact and impossible to make skip.  It suits my needs .compact. ease of use. more mobile than a CD player. just fine.  It has also been dropped once with no ill effects.I could not be more pleased with this purchase. and highly recommend it for others looking for mp3 players!,5,1,2279
A2VN8DIGMYOPMK,8687,Because of my satisfaction with Olympus 35MM cameras and the ratings of the D340R on this site. I decided to buy an Olympus D340R.

A2VNAENQG1WFCL,1315,I bought this product back in August after seeing all the negative reviews about Sonys products. At the time the 120 had all positive reviews so I felt comfortable about buying it. I did not want to spend more than USD on any DVD because I know Ill be buying another as soon as you can record  with them. I was really surprised by all the problems Ive read about  recently. Did Panasonic change something in their manufacturing in  September? I have had no problems with any DVDs or CDs. This includes all  movies from Alien to Saving Private Ryan DTS. Once in a while a movie will  freeze for about 12 a second and then continue without problem. Usually I  ask someone if they noticed it and then forget about it. But in light of  all the problems Ive read about I decided not to take a chance this  Christmas and gave 2 Pioneer DVD players as gifts. So I am satisfied but if  problems do occur in the future. I will repost a review. Hope this helps.,4,1,951

I did not want to a headset because these have to be shared among the referees. I bought 1 and tested it with my Cobra Microtalks and it keyed great voice and provided loud audio playback.

A2VUJKAZ0THD6G,0,Got this RCA ANT200 from a local BestBuy .... It works slightly WORSE than my nonamplified Recoton 350 antenna .old one. ...OK.. In fact the Recoton gets better reception on two channels .11 and 13. than the RCA. The amplifier in the ANT200 introduces sligh amount of noise. which makes the picture a bit brighter. but not better or clearer. The ghosts do not diminish either. The snow is about the same. Im returning it... It has an AB switch whith lets me compare the two antennae immediately without switching the cables. so the differences .or the lack there of for the most part. bw the two were obvious. Not worth it in my opinion compared to a cheaper nonamplified antenna for the reception I get. Perhaps for weaker signals in remote areas it might be better. but in the urban area where I live it does not improve anything beyond the nonamp antenna I got.,2,0,864

A2VXI5LB32RN6O,0,I bought the Belkin Gold Series Surgemaster II F5C895TEL more than 3 years ago. Recently I had a problem with equipment plugged into the surge suppressor and the problem was traced to the power strip .the green light that is supposed to be on saying the strip is protecting was not on.. When I purchased the power strip it came with a Lifetime Warranty. I contacted Belkin to use the warranty  the Belkin responsevia email. was that what they gave me was a LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANY and that since they are no longer producing this power strip they will not honor their warranty. They sent me a link to purchase another one. So I called their Customer Care Dept. at 8002235546. and they told me that the Limited Lifetime Warranty is only good while they are producing the product and after that they dont support or replace the defective product. This seems UNSATISFACTORY to me. I thought a Lifetime Warranty would be good as long as I owned the product.,1,0,954
A2VXVM93S96FHS,33,I love reading. and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didnt want to carry any heavy things. This is great! I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books! I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isnt very good. I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary. which means it doesnt explain the word fully but still doesnt allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...,4,1,449
A2VY3VF9QBB8I,0,Gee.... I kick myself for not checking out this at Amazon.  I recently bought two 50 foot ethernet cable from Best Buy. they cost USD45 each. USD100 totalled!!,5,0,159
A2VY42XKROO233,44,I was thinking it would be like the old one I had with video and audio instructions.  It isnt anything like it.  It doesnt seem to work.  On my first VCR it ran for just a few seconds and stopped and turned the VCR off.  On the second VCR. it was playing... nothing. but had a lot of static and  jumping.  I thought it might be damaging the VCR.  I hadt read the reviews on this until after I tried.  I wish I had.,1,0,414
A2VYL13O4RUFY9,11,I would highly recommend this card  I too am an MCSE and manage a medium sized LANWAN environment.  I have used several of these cards in my local LAN and have found them to be easy to set up and completely reliable.  In  my opinion. the assumed superreliability of the 3Com card is completely  offset by the excessive price.  Save some money and buy the Netgear card.,4,1,368
A2VYQFMARER8EA,77,It is an ereader and it does that well. the web browsing is an afterthought and a bonus in my eyesnice in a pinch. the 3 complaints i have is that you cannot zoom a pdf which is silly. that you cannot view txt files on it. and that you can not organize your books or music. compared to the other readers on the market it is one of the bestand i bought it at Bu0026N for USD250 and it came with a USD50 gift card. Great value for USD200. Buy the 2 year no Qs asked warranty and buy accessories on amazon. you win ..,4,1,514
A2VZ5YSTIWFBDD,55,I cant believe the quality of sound that this headset produces.  I was not expecting much to be honest for the price.  I thought I would be  returning and purchasing a more expensive item.  This headset performs  great with Dialpad.com and Firetalk.com applications. It also works good  for multimedia applications as stereo headset.,4,1,333
A2VZCEF6UFLB0B,1010,For a unit with advanced features.this unit is remarkably easy to use .even for the klutz in the family..

A2W0ABJS6LPBIH,0,I had some difficulty getting channels 26 .low band.with this antenna. These channels tend to be very hard to tune into because of electrical interference. Plus. the fact that I live in a basement. Outdoor antennae  are still the best provided you dont have to drop your coax cable beyond  15 ft.,1,0,296
A2W21RS38YK2G7,1830,I couldnt use for my camera. Kodak C340.  It would not format.  I had to use a smaller GB. I had to switch my 2 GB picture frame disk and use that.  Should not be advertised for C340 camera.,1,0,190
A2W3155A699S0B,0,Getting the drive to read a floppy requires clicking around in control panel to select the device. Reads 1.44 mb floppies just fine. but gives cryptic excuses about unformatted disks when trying to read old floppies of less capacity. Truth is. the device does exactly what it says it will do  process 1.44 mb floppies. Will not use this to write anything on a floppy. so cant testify to that. Just reading some old data I have on floppies. Amazed that the floppies can still be read after decades of storage. Probably this drive deserves better than my opinion. Im just frustrated because in the olden days you could just stick any floppy in a drive and it would read automatically and both old and new style floppies.,3,0,718
A2W3TC4JG0KKY5,0,I acquired a CineVision VCRDVD that had been used mostly  to convert VHS to DVDs. an then it was stored for many years.  Before I used this product. I was unable to get a decent picture.  After using it once. a  good  picture resulted. just like it stated it would do on the product box.,4,1,287
A2W55K7B58H3V4,0,This shower radio is the best that I have owned.  Weather bands. TV and AMFM radio. all in one neat package.  Waterresistant topside controls make it easy to select what you want.  It includes a nice timer to automatically turn the radio off after a preset time.  It includes a small wire antenna attached to a suction cup. which really helps the reception.  Powered by three C batteries. which last a lot longer than a single 9 volt.  This thing was well thought out and seems to be well built.  A little pricey. but well worth it.,5,1,532
A2W5U7KEK1SB0P,22,This item was just as advertised.Ive only used it once but it functioned great.The item was a good buy and I am very pleased.,4,0,125
A2W6O3STPHLXGO,11,As far as MP3 players go. this one is quite disappointing.It is indeed capable of playing .mp3 files. but thats where the product ceases to impress.  Unlike many of its competitors. this device uses an apparently proprietary memory format and USB interface you have to use either RioPorts bloated software or a dodgy userwritten workaround to load songs.  Whats more. the strange formatting means that if you expand the Rio 500 with a SmartMedia card and then move that card to another device. youll have to reformat it and lose the data currently stored there.Oh. and the bundled headphones are worthless.  They fall apart after a few uses or even being carried in a pocket.Quite frankly. I dont want or expect copyright enforcement in my media player.  Thats kind of like making a car that the owner cant get back out of. just in case they drive it into a restricted area.Another design flaw may be found smack in the middle of the units back  the serial number sticker.  The sticker is cheap and unprotected. which means your serial number and bar code rub off after carrying the device in your pocket a few times.  Since one must have the serial number to download an updated version of the devices firmware or loading software. you would be well advised to write the number somewhere a little safer.The last problem is compatability. and its a big one.  SonicBlue and RioPort have not seen fit to develop reliable driver software for Windows 2000 or XP.  This means youll need either a lot of luck or a Windows 9598ME machine to use your Rio 500.Ill never buy another product with the Diamond. SonicBlue. or RioPort logo on it again.  I advise you to do the same.,2,0,1668
A2W6VA8EZ7UGJ7,3,I guess Ive been really lucky. After 45 years .?.. my players just starting to give c.13 errors  on about 20 percent of my Netflix rentals. One hint for people having problems. my players become very sensitive to heat and shuts down frequently unless I give it very good ventilation. So try fanning your DVD player if you cant get through an entire movie. .Talk about being a slave to technology!.,3,0,397
A2W76T2KBX1MNF,33,I have found this device to be the answer to my dilemma.  I am able to take all my desktop PIM information in a convenient. tiny package.  And better. it can be easily replaced if lost. broken.  Highly recommended for  those needing a convenient PIM on wheels.,5,1,260
A2W8L7O2RC73OX,34,Opened the box and was impressed with the appearance. Started to review each piece. The battery packs are a bit flimsy. Put the fresh AA batteries in one pack and 8 rechargables in the other and went outside to try it. Only heard static on the CB bands. Tried the weather bands and heard WX 1 loud and clear. Hooked up the radio in my car and connected the outside antenna. same result on CB bands. Tried a second mobil antenna on car with same results. Checked antenna with another CB and it worked.It appears that the Midland is a very attractive toy but not really a usable CB.Glad I bought it from Amazon so there is no problem returning.,2,0,642
A2W8S84IGPZV3X,35,This is a great machine regardless of price. and given its cost. it an amazing deal.  Not only does it play some titles my last player wouldnt. but I swear they actually LOOK better on this player.  It also has a smooth  fastforeward speed that my last player didnt have. and the onscreen menu  setup is the best Ive seen.,5,1,322
A2W9B62C2QAFU1,22,Good luck trying to get the device to recognize your handheldremote controls.  The documentation is badly written and evencontradictory is some spots. On page 8. Step 5. it says u0026quotRepeat step 3 u0026amp 4 for additional devicesu0026quot.  On the very same page. after Step 6. it says u0026quotRepeat steps 2.3 u0026amp 4 for additional devicesu0026quot.  OK. folks. which one is it?  I taught a ReplayTV remote to learn how to control 3 devices. set up all the cabling. and had no trouble running a complex TV. 2VCR. ReplayTV set up until I got to this product.  Its been over one day now. and I still have to select devices manually.... There is nothing on the RCA website of any technical help.  Also. you will not find any description in the documentation of how this product is supposed to work with your remotes after it u0026quotlearnsu0026quot the codes.  How do you know its working then?  Dont waste USD80 on this kludge.  Go get a cheap manual switch.  It will work with a lot less aggravation.,1,0,1011

A2WB5DBZFTXPIQ,44,The Mexican plant must have unhappy workers.  2 paks of 8. and each tape is defective.  Either the case is broken or there are loose parts rattling around inside.  Now well see how Sony stands behind their warranty.  Even if they send replacements Ill probably throw them away.  Its not worth breaking a VCR on these cheap. worthless tapes.,1,0,340
A2WBE0LDXX7X0S,57,I purchased this item so that i could travel from room to room without having to go wireless.  Well. have you ever encountered a tangled phone cord?  This item is 10 times worse!  It is a big ball of nothing but . tangles. claiming to be snagless. I am running out to purchase a wireless router and be done with it. I wish i saved the box and receipt for it. i would have returned this piece of garbage.,1,0,403
A2WCD8JOLSW7DP,138,These are great for everyday use. They are reasonably priced so you can give these away.You can record over these up to 3 times without noting any noise on the recording evenat the SLP mode.Great quality at a decent price.,5,1,222
A2WCETVJ4JXMEA,44,After just buying a new Canon Power Shot Camera. we wanted the cable that would allow us to view the video clips directly from the camera to our HD TV.  This was the HDMI cable we needed.  The price was far below the Canon cord and this one has worked great for us.  The delivery was much faster than we expected. so we were delighted with that. as well.,4,1,354
A2WDTIACHTRC6X,11,I ordered this camera for my Dad.  He needed an easytouse camera for his real estate business.  The easiest I could imagine was pictures on floppy disks to e.mail to clients. no USB transfer.I worked with the camera for a week and it was great.  I had to give it up to him reluctantly. so Im ordering another to use in my web site business.,4,1,340
A2WDVCH8EM3B6G,33,Good old modern technology. It keeps changing daily. Writer can not figure out if they want us to read from a nook or one of their competitors. I have two .nook u0026 kindle. u0026 that is my limit. The nook shows it in black u0026 white. The kindle shows it in color. If I can not read what I want from either one of these ereader. I guess I will have to read it the old fashion way  paper.,4,1,391
A2WE8CHA5CPNFJ,13,This is an excellent buy for the first time user. I bought this for my parents to use who have very little technological prowess and they love it. The USB connection and simplied instruction booklet make for unintimidating  ease of use  an important factor when buying for older family members. The  picture quality is great for the price.,4,1,339
A2WEIAM3EMFJJU,69,I expected more from this microphone after reading the reviews. Afterall this is only a mic there is no headset which might make it worth the purchase. The mic boom is flimsy and can not even stay in position without scotch tape. I could not test the mute feature since the amazon dealer did not send that part. And as for the mic quality I could careless because it is unwearable. This makes the product useless for me. I hope others have a better experience.,1,0,460
A2WEPVTIEEXYZP,4,Althogh it has **GOOD** software I have seen much better quality what would have made me not care about quality is if would have came with better software like Avid Cinema. The Price is ***AWSOME***. If you buy this TV  tuner card then you should also buy Avid Cinema!,4,1,268
A2WES4WH45Q4S4,7,My husband and I have two of these now and are very satisfied with them. We bought the second one because we were happy with the first one.They are great for parties when our guests are both indoors and outdoors. Farthest weve tried them is about 100 feet from the house. and they work fine. We use the provided power supply and have had no problem. They dont sound like a highend speaker. but they are adequate. We recommend them to our guests that are surprised at how well they work outside.Also great when Im in a different part of the house from the big stereo. but maybe someone wants to watch TV in the room where the stereo is. We just turn down the stereo volume in the main room and I take the speaker with me.Dont expect to easily find replacement parts thru the manufacturer. though. Youre pretty much on your own.,4,1,826
A2WEZN9LFOMDUH,11,After using the unit that was provided by the phone company when you sign up for the service I must say I should have purchased this from the beginning. The display lights up and a flashing red light alerts you to a  new call or call waiting. Make sure you have 4 AAA batteries.,5,1,278
A2WFBRX9R0D84U,2022,I have had my new Nook Color for about 24 hours so here are my early impressions.Pro.  good quality. good color. responsive to light touch. connects easily to WiFi. good eMail service. easy access to Barnes u0026 Noble eBooks.  Very B u0026 N friendly.  Very good battery charge life.Con.  Lousy quick setup guide .more like an advertisement.. Only responds to finger touch .I prefer a screen that accepts stylus touch.  I have large hands and fingers..  Lousy speakers .but I expected that.  I Havent been able to download movies from Netflix. Ill keep working on that.  Connection to Netflix was the main reason for buying the Nook Color.  Difficult to download other products.  No night time screen.  On line manual .u003e100 pages. is almost useless.This is my second tablet in the last month.  The first was a PanDigital Novel which I returned because it was an Android 2.0 and had limited capabilities and no access to Netflix.  AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE .NONE..  There is a B u0026 N store 10 minutes from whre I live.  In the past I have spoken to the folks there and they seem very knowledgeable.  I will visit them again with my list of questions.  Ill do an update to this in a couple of weeks.Update.  Raised my rating to a 5 *.  I found out I needed to do a software update .from 1.3 to 1.4.1. in order to get NETFLIX.  The nice man at the B u0026 N store did this for me in about 6 minutes.  I now get NETFLIX with very good reception.  At this time I really dont care about additional apps.  Everything I think I will ever want is in the NOOK Color now.  EMail in and out.  Downloads books from the Public Library in seconds.  Internet browsing ok.  eBay access is ok.  Bought a game for USD0.99 just to check out my B u0026 N account.  Easy.  NETFLIX was easy to set up.  Battery charge lasts longer than anticpated.  The software upgrade has made the device overall more user friendly.  The only complaint I still have is that I cant use a stylus.  Maybe I can exchange my fingers for a smaller set.  NOT SORRY I BOUGHT THIS GADGET.  Also. good quality and GREAT customer support.,5,1,2101
A2WFZRROXKW6QH,33,I bought this player for my daughter in Feb. of 2000. it broke down twice in six months. The second time I had to send it back I tried to get the company to replace the lemon but all they did was send me a bill. The parts that were repaired had to be made because of lousey workmanship. I would not recomend this player to anyone. especialy at the price they charge for it.,1,0,373
A2WGGA6W04PU3W,1112,The item is very complicated to use if you want to download public library books. quite an ordeal . you need first to get an adobe program then download book to computer etc. What is most objectionable is the pricing by amazon. The item is listed at USD219 retail sold at amazon for USD72 at a considerable markdown making it sound very attractive . Yet at Band N if you walk in. the same Nook is priced at USD79 and you get a USD20 gift card if you buy one . So there is something deceptive if not downright dishonest in the way the item is advertised at Amazon..,3,0,564
A2WGHNYAHJ7O4T,22,Product arrived on time as promised. and was everything they had said it was.  The only concern I have about the product is that the battery runs out faster than all reviews on it that Ive seen.  The battery runs out in 34 hrs. and not 8+ that so many others have claimed.,4,1,272
A2WGO4ICTDOQZD,0,When i got this item I was a bit sceptical but it works and marvellously at that!Again I have to mention that Amazon does not deliver to Malta so I had it sent to a friend in the States who in turn posted it to me.you could sell more items if you were to deliver here. after all I used Us postal services!,4,1,305

A2WI7CUMAXZLUJ,1414,be aware of this device. it is not supported by the Galaxy Tab 3 7 inches.  the title displayed for this product is OEM MHL 2.0 Samsung Galaxy tab 3 7.0 HDMI to micro usb smartphone adapter..... it is a lie... Samsung states that the Galaxy tab 3 7 inch is not designed to use such a device... and there is no support for it... what do you think?  wrong advertisement? only 8 inches and 10 inches version of the tab 3 will use this... i feel fooled because of this. i trusted seller and i found a lemon here...,1,0,510
A2WIKA2TYZ2H7T,22,I got three 75822 for the sake of communication for 34 miles.  I got them just in few days due to my Prime account but hugely disappointed.  These CB radio with stock antenna would not have more than 50 yards.  Yes 50 YARDS.  It is a piece of junk.  I have not try with car antenna but that is not the purpose of use.  I want some mobility and these were like toys.  I would stay away from them.......,1,0,401
A2WJ4CTJ763IEQ,28,I love my Nook.  For the price. I couldnt ask for anything better.  Barnes and Noble do not really give good instructions on how to borrow library books. but once I figured it out. borrowing from the library is extremely simple!  I saw some people think glare is a problem. and I was worried about that.  It has not been a problem for me.  I think the display looks pretty similar to the look of a book page.  Some people also complained about the weight.  I think its fine.  The Nook is a lot lighter than some of the books I have read. so I dont think the weight of the Nook is an issue either.  If you are looking for a simple ereader at a great price. the Nook will work out well for you.,5,1,692
A2WJXH7U4OVOW8,22,If you are looking for a great WIRELESS option. this is certainly the way to go.  The range is greatI can listen to them anywhere in the house or in the yard.  The sound is crisp and clear. though there is a minute amount of background hiss because of the FM transmission.  Initial charging takes awhile to hold .a full 24 hours.. but after that an overnight charge generally lasts 45 hours.  The bass is reduced standard. but if compensated by equalizing at the source. you can make them sound great.Why the emphasis on WIRELESS?  Because lets face it. their not a USD100 pair of corded phones.  The slight FM background hiss. the ocassional static and RF interference. and the need to charge them can at times be annoying.  Corded phones typically have no hiss. great response with big bass. and can be less bulky.  But I particularly needed wireless phones and find that they are great for all of my needs.  I would recommend them to anyone who hates being tied to a chair or small range when wearing headphones.If hifi unity sound is your goal. look for some corded phones.  If you want cordless. these are certainly worth the money.,4,1,1137
A2WK407IUB25KL,2022,How can they get away with selling this stuff?  First and foremost. IT DOES NOT WORK.  Secondly. it can make your disc WORSE.Look elsewhere  do NOT buy this junk.,1,0,162
A2WL349JI5LCWX,13,Mine is a just over a year old. Guess what? Yep. its croaking. In fact. every Sony product I bought the past decade  a phone. 2 portable CD players. a TV. and now this  failed just after the warranty expired. Ive finally learned my lesson.,1,0,239
A2WL4A1VG4TE2I,33,I have owned my TRV310 for approx. 9 months now. For the money this is a fantastic camera that completely blows away similarly priced analog cameras. The main reason? Its digital! No more tape dropouts! I videotaped  an entire season of High School football on the same 2 tapes .9 games. and  even after 9 recycles. there was not a single dropout or tape error.  Amazing! The image is equivalent to miniDV .the main varaible being the  type of lenses that the cameras may use. and it has been totally reliable  under many different conditions.  On the downside. there is no manual  white balance and no manual volume control for the audio. If Sony had  included these 2 features I would have given this camera a 5 star rating.  Also. the LCD screen is extremely difficult. if not impossible. to use  outdoors in bright sunlight. .This is a problem with all camcorder LCD  screens and not just this one..  All in all I would say that for the  money. this camcorder is a spectacular value. Now if Sony will only come  out with a Digi8 recordplayback deck so I dont have to use my camcorder  as a VCR.,4,1,1098
A2WN5H5NFGW8NM,2729,Contrary to what some reviewers mentioned. mine did ship with the necessary USB cable.  The pamphlet included mentioned a CD to install drivers if it didnt work upon plugin. but there was no CD.  Plastic wrapper was damaged. but product was not damaged and works well.,4,1,268

A2WNTVEHBBT77H,12,This item arrived dead on the spot. The computer did not recognize it. and never charged. You get what you pay for. I guess. Instead of trying to return the item. I wont even bother with it.,1,0,190
A2WO3HF88DF4PW,0,Just to give you a brief history. I had contacted CITI electronics before buying this product. if it is going to be compatible with my Canon HF200 video camera. Their response YES. Considering how much the original one costs. I went the cheaper route and it bit me right back. THIS CABLE DOES NOT WORK. Citi electronics lied .Just another California bases electronics retailer selling Chinese junk.. Now. they expect me to pay for shipping even if the product is defective. Wonder if Amazon even goes through a selection process anymore. Overall. a very very bad experience. Never buying anything from Citi electronics again. Will have to buy original canon cable. There should be a way of actually making it zero star.,1,0,719
A2WOYWVWFEWCHA,25,Have been running Windows XP.  XP recognizes it as a generic faxmodem and answers the phone everytime it rings as a fax interfering with incoming calls.

A2WOZ5EUCIDOM3,44,I bought these speakers about 3 months ago to use in my garage and was amazed at the sound quality considering the price. Im currently in the process of building a go cart. and I plan to buy another set of these speakers to mount on each side of the seat. I have alreighty tested them with a Dual 52Wx4 CD Deck and they work perfectly. The CD Deck is going to be mounted into a small armreststorage compartment on the right hand side of the seat. and run off a 12V motorcycle battery thats connected to the motors alternator.So. this just shows a couple of the many uses of these speakers. Weather you just want good. affordable sound in your garage. or go to the extreme and have a really cool sound system on a GO CART. these speakers are a great choice.,5,1,756

A2WQ7V53ICWZV5,44,The headset is useful and seems a good deal compared to the price of the earbud with microphone. but the bulkiness somewhat defeats the purpose of the compact radio.  The highest sensitivity setting on the VOX is too low  for quiet environments its better to use the PTT mode at those times.  The PTT works better either way. because theres a slight delay before the  VOX circuitry kicks in and begins transmitting. Generally the VOX is  handiest in those situations where its really necessary i.e. no hands  available to hit the button.  Note also that if the transmit button is  accidentally depressed. it reverts to PTT mode and the radio needs to be  powered off and on again to reset to VOX mode.  The earbud without  microphone is the most cost effective way to use the radio it allows for  private conversation and allows the monitoring of conversations without  holding the radio up to the ear. while giving best audio quality by using  the built in microphone. Either earbud can be considered a necessity. while  the headset is for more limited use applications.,3,0,1071
A2WT8JAHDV28W4,3134,For those who have had problems with screen. scratching. a solution we have found is using PDA screen protectors cut down to fit.  It worked so well on my dads that he borrowed more of my screen protectors to put them  on all the cameras at his work.  Some brands will also reduce reflections  off the screen.  The scratches that were there are not visible once the  protector is put on.  As far as the Sony Mavica cameras go. the convenience  of the floppy disks makes it very usable technology that is easily  incorporated into life.,5,1,535

A2WWDICCKKZ9SS,11,It worked with the radio I bought .Motorola Talkabout MC220R 16Mile 22Channel FRSGMRS TwoWay Radio which kinda sucked by the way. but the mic is comfy but comes out sometimes.

A2WXORHUS0BMBN,0,No bass. It really *does* sound like you are listening to a .distant. transistor radio through a coke can.  I cant believe they put these on the market. Back to Walgreeens.,1,0,172
A2WYFLTDS19XQY,0,I got this to connect my Canon 7D to the TV. I like the low price and the quality of picture i get on TV but the cable is a bit hard to windup for storing in the bag. I wish the rubber compound used to make the cable is a bit softer to handle.,4,1,243
A2WYGYU5G52B8V,34,Purchased two of these hunting for a good quality tape that would last for repeated taping. Seems to be good quality in comparison to previously using RCA. Maxell and Magnavox brands. Unfortunately. after purchasing these. I found the same tapes in a store for a little less. but no big deal.,4,1,292
A2WZ2FO4LNOBLD,33,This bracket does not fit the tv. as it says it did in the product description.  Very disappointed in the product. Had to return it and pay for the shipping cost. which wasnt cheap. due to weight of bracket.  Dont waste your money on this!,1,0,239
A2WZXI8BGIC5KN,2,I just purchased this portable cd player.  I was very excited it came with a car kit. as I will use it primarily in my vehicle.  I was very impressed with the sound quality the cd player has. My only complaint is that the 40 second anti shock isnt as good as it is advertised.  If I hit a bump on the road or just with just walking it worked fine. however if I moved the cd player around alot while it was one. it skipped a lot.Overall I really like the cd player and it was a good value.,4,1,488
A2X0NHTY53EVQ3,0,Decided to stock up on blank tape while I still have the chance.  I havent made a VHS recording in years. but still play a lot of prerecorded tapes.  I decided that I should have a few blank tapes around just in case the DVDHDD machine died for some reason.  This actually happened once already.  I didnt want to get the budget quality tape at the local discount store. so I opted for some decent Maxell High Grade like I used to get.,4,1,434
A2X11IHRN9J78O,1,A great product.  3 CDs and all the standard paper inserts that come with them fit in the space of a single jewel case.  Very useful for bringing a bag full .Case Logic makes some bags. in the car.,5,0,197

A2X39BUTMMN5GJ,0,These jacks never said anything on the product detail on the website about not working with caller ID. I bought them specifically to work with my satellite box so I could get caller ID on my TV. The package got thrown away and now I am stuck with something I will never use. Dont buy. There are other products out there that work as a wireless phone jack and work with caller ID!!!,1,0,381

A2X6ACE9J2KYM3,23,After two quick failures of generic clones of this battery purchased from the internet. I thought that the extra expense of an  official  Sony battery via Amazon would save me anymore headaches and disappointments.  Wrong!  The packaging seemed authentic for Sony but the battery provided me with about ten images. went dead and does not take ANY charge.  The charger is in working order.Now I need to spend the effort to discover how to receive another battery from either Amazon or the supplier.,1,0,497
A2X6BRXJV9KEI9,0,I cant assess the quality of this product because it didnt work at all. I followed the instructions to the letter and heard absolutely nothing .not even a dial tone. on the remote phone. Obviously. something is sorely  lacking in quality control. I am returning the device.,1,0,273

A2X84FWM24BYQ2,34,I have used this product a lot with multipe type cards.  Works every time.  Its small so it fits in my pocket if Im on the go around the office.  The only con is that the rubber cover doesnt fit well over time. but since I keep it in a pouch in my backpack it really doesnt matter.,4,1,281
A2X88PDE3UIEZT,11,Dont pay more than USD2 per megabyte for Compact Flash.  Thats the sweet point.  If you dont find it for USD2MB then keep shopping.  This is NOT the best price.,1,0,160
A2X8KN82L07RSK,5158,This was my first and only digital camera that I purchased as a display item will I was working at CompUSA. If I remember correctly. at the time this camera was over USD300 but I got it for USD50.I have no idea how old this camera was when I bought it. but despite that. it lasted an additional 3 12 years before it stopped working the battery connections went bad. I took it apart to see if I could fix it. but to no avail.The 1.3 Megapixels was more than sufficent for me. it took crystal clear pictures everytime. I really enjoyed the LCD screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture. It also had a USB slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your PC. My only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneous.This camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials. This camera had been dropped a few times. but it still functioned without any problems. I have taken thousands of pictures on this camera. not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before I came to own it. and I have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this camera.After my DC240 finally met its demise. I was dissapointed to find that Kodak no longer made cameras like this. instead they make these plastic. cheap looking. cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the DC series. I purchased a DX model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because I was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera. To this day the DC240 has been my only digital camera and I havent had one since. I will have to turn to EBAY to get something from the DC series. because unfortunately companies no longer make them like they used to.,4,1,1745
A2X8NZUNAWX9SO,11,This is a very good product! It still take a charge! Very good echarable battery. My husband uses it for his recording mixer! Good to have for outdoors use.,3,0,156
A2X96F4VA0IKZX,0,I spent the last month researching PDAs.  The Casio PV200 is a great value!  If you want or need email function. this product is NOT for you.  However. for keeping track of your appointments. businesspersonal  contacts. this item is great.  Ive read some of the negative  comments...they must be referring to the PV100 model.  Be sure to purchase  the PV200A .with the silver colored screen protector..  The onscreen key  pad makes entries very easy.  It defaults to capitalize the first word of  each sentence and u0026quotremembersu0026quot frequent words youve entered.  So.  after you type u0026quotBiru0026quot the word u0026quotBirthdayu0026quot will  appearsimply tap the word and save time.  One touch shows your next  scheduled appointment.  It has a daily alarm. reminder alarms. etc.  This  is a great product for the money.  I do not use the PC Sync function. so I  cannot comment on it.  This product is advertised on the internet anywhere  from USD99.99 to USD149.99.,4,1,981
A2XA5L9I7LJ1MN,33,I purchased the Dazzle Video Creator in hope of transfering my analog vhs tapes into a digital format.  It was a neat idea. a plug and play option that I could install without opening the computer case. Great idea. right?Well. this is where everything goes wrong.  After istalling the software bundle and getting the Dazzle up and running I ran into severe problems.  Mainly being the computer just wouldnt recognize the audio or sound files.  Hey. no problem Ill just call tech support to get this ironed out.  Much to my dissatisfaction I found out thier tech support was almost nonextistant.  They never and let me repeat never helped me at all ever to get this problem ironed out.So save your dough and buy a real video capture card and save your money or you could end up let me with a totally worthless piece of junk that dont work.,1,0,838
A2XA9KKAAFXQMH,1516,This player is an excellent performer with its antishock and extra bass options.  Unfortunately. unlike its predecessors it offers little physical shock resistance. so you have to leave the antishock on or itll skip when you set it down.It plays CDR discs with no problem but has a strange  quirk with CDRW audio discs it will play them 3 or 4 times but after that  wont recognize them.  Erasing and rerecording the disc does make it go  away. but its not worth it.The battery life is excellent. even with the  antishock on.  One feature from older Panasonics that I miss is the  ability to quickly pull the ACDC adapter out of the back of the unit while  it was playing.  The old ones switched to battery this one shuts  off.Dont buy this unit for the remote wireless remotes on portable CD  players are not worth extra money.  Unlike wired ones. they get lost easily  and must be pointed at the unit.The tape adapter works just fine and the  AC and DC adapters run very cool . . .,4,1,982
A2XA9KKAAFXQMH,7071,Surely you have better things to spend your hardearned money on than this pathetic little infomercialesque gimmick.What the product promises is  that it will restore performance for CDs. DVDs. and other 5.25u0026quot  optical media.  I found otherwise.I purchased a DVD movie that I was  really excited about seeing.  I got it and popped it into my player.  The  picture. sound. etc. were of course excellent DVD quality.  Then at one  point .1h42m33s. everything stopped.  I couldnt fastforward past this  spot. so I took the disc out and looked at it.  There seemed to be a  fingerprint or smudge on the disc. so I figured Id use the SkipDoctor to  fix it.  Big mistake.After carefully following the instructions in the  manual .a 10minute laborintensive process in the middle of my movie.. I  put the disc back into the player.  It wouldnt even startit was  completely unplayable.  After the expense and effort of using the  SkipDoctor. I was worse off than before.  I finally finished the movie on  VHS.Overall recommendation. Run for your life.,1,0,1049
A2XA9KKAAFXQMH,3031,NiMH rechargeable batteries are a step above the standard NiCads that gave rechargeables their bad rep.  NiMHs usually provide more stable and  slightly higher voltage .though still below alkaline levels. for extended  periods of time.  They have no u0026quotmemoryu0026quot problem. so you dont  have to worry about completely discharging them. and depending on the  situation. they may perform either better or slightly worse than  alkalines.For instance. I always use NiMH batteries in my CD player.  They last about 90% as long as alkalines and. of course. are reusable.  A  quick onehour charge will get the same pair going again.Where NiMHs  really shine. though. is in momentary highdrain devices such as digital  cameras and camera flashes.  In a recent report. Consumer Reports had to  rescale its battery ratings because NiMHs perform so well.  In one digital  camera that I use. alkalines will last for one flashcard of pictures  NiMHs last for over 3.While the Energizer .and recently Rayovac. brands  are quite inexpensive. they only last about 85% as long as the Radio Shack  brand.  Cost versus run life is the only consideration here. and these  batteries are just great for CD or tape players.Note. You will need a  NiMHspecific charger to charge these batteries.Overall recommendation.  If you use even a moderate number of batteries frequently or listen to  music on a portable player. NiMHs are a worthy investment.,4,1,1435
A2XA9KKAAFXQMH,1401,I had been considering purchasing noisecancelling headphones for some time.  When I saw these for such a low price. I decided to order.  Im glad I did.The headphones are permanently attached to a small beltclip unit  about the size of a pack of baseball cards.  The unit has an onoff switch  .for the cancelling part. and a volume control.  A 3 cord ending in a  standard 18u0026quot stereo plug comes out the bottom of the pack.The  phones have great .but not excellent. response.  They are designed as part  of the NC system and so have their best output at about 150Hzwhich is  great not only for rock and pop but classical as well.  When you turn on  the NC. the sound is damped in the higher frequencies. which actually  makes everything much clearer.  Just dont use u0026quotSuper Bassu0026quot on  your CD player because the sound will get muddy.  Without it. though. I was  able to enjoy classicalon a recent plane flight without any  distractionswhich brings me to the NC aspect of these headphones.The  noise cancelling is centered around 150Hz. which is the pitch of most plane  engines but works quite well for cars and buses too.  On my last plane  flight. I turned the noise cancelling on as soon as we took off.  It  removed the engine noise so well that I started to get annoyed by the  halfvolume airconditioning noise that it let through.  By the time I  turned them off. I really had forgotten how much they were blocking the  engine noise and was surprised how loud it was.The box says that it will  run for about 22 hours on a pair of AAs. but Ive had it running for over  30 hours without problems.  It *will* run on rechargeables. but I strongly  recommend NiMH if you choose to do so.Overall recommendation. A  highquality set of phones. especially considering the price for NC  headphones.  I recommend them for any frequent traveler.,5,1,1859
A2XAHMYEW1INU8,78,My wife bought this for me. I like the style and looks of it but the latches are a real pain. There are times where I only have one hand to open my briefcase and its not possible with these latches. The way the latches are designed. so close to together. you have to use both hands to open it. Even then it took me a while to get used to opening it. Then a month later one of the tiny screws popped out and the whole  button  fell out. I hate this bag so much now.,2,0,464
A2XBJRRK6ZNALI,0,I replaced the CD Drive on my old pc with a DVD Drive. and played a DVD. Works fine. Then I put the DVD in my Sony DVD player and it skips every other minute.All these days .3 years.. I thought it was problem with the DVDs. but I just realised it is the Sony problem. Ive had this problem after since 6 months of purchase.I stopped Netflix stating that their DVDs skipped a lot. Sorry Netflix. it is my piece of junk called Sony.Sony. I feel cheated. I am never going to buy any thing Sony again.Is there a 0 star rating ??,1,0,523
A2XBRHNYRYHKJA,0,Weve gone through so many lousy shower radios. This one is the best yet. It is good solid design and fine reception. Easy to use controls and accurate fine tuning of stations.

A2XE6OZS0Y6QSC,12,This label tape works perfectly with my Brother Ptouch PT70 label maker.  The labels stick to plastic. glass. paper.  They are just as described!,4,0,145
A2XEFXUZVO3IKO,11,I might have only given this radio three stars. but I think it gets a fourth for the performance it delievers at it price level.AM and FM reception are quite good for a little radio like this. Shortwave reception is mixed.  On one hand. you can pick up many stations. not just the big highpowered broadcasters that you get on low priced radios .BBC. CBC. etc...  On the other hand. they come with a lot of noise and fading distortion. and you get nothing but a localDX switch to try to improve the situation. Theres no ability to microtune. switchable audio or bandwidth filters. etc.  I therefore feel that this is definintely an aboveaverage radio on SW for its price. but that enthusiasts should spend more money and get something that will make distant or weak stations more pleasant to listen to.  .Then again. I have come to believe that internet broadcasting is going to render SW obsolete in the U.S. and similarly developed countries. so maybe a megabuck radio is just an unncessary expense..Sound quality through the internal speaker is poor.  I assume this is because Grundig made a design decision to minimize battery consumption. size and weight. but that comes at the expense of a decent audio section.  The sound is adequate for desktop or bedside listening of voice broadcasts.  But music is tinny and the radio doesnt have enough juice to play across a midsized domestic room without distorting.  Headphone listening is significantly better.  If you think of it more as a walkmantype radio with a courtesy speaker for when the phones are inconvenient. youll probably be pretty satisfied.The radio is pretty easy to operate. looks good. and doesnt feel cheap.  The sleep timer is a nice convenience. There are a couple things that bugged me though. One is that you have to shift between high and low shortwave bands. and cycle through FM and AM to get from SW2 down to SW1.  Annoying and anachronistic.  The second is that you lose your presets and clock time when your batteries go dead.  I wouldnt have minded some more presets either. since I like to set favorite shortwave braodcasters on several of their frequencies to pick the clearest signal at any given time.The radio is a good value. especially when it is discounted.  With the u0026quotPEu0026quot version. not only do you get an aboveaverage radio for the money. you get the ac adaptor. headphones. wire antenna. cheesy case. and a booklet. too.  Some of their competitors make you buy this stuff separately for a good USD20 or so.Finally. a word of warning.  There is some older stock of this radio floating around that appears identical to current production but has less frequency coverage than the current model .and may lack some other electronic impovements too..  I actually got stuck with one of the older ones.,4,1,2798
A2XEN5FGF0DNRW,3838,I have used the Iomega zip drive for over 1 12 years. and it is great. If you ever need to back something up. or if you need a drive to download to from the internet. the 100 Meg  250 Meg zip is the way to go.,3,0,209

A2XF6MGC772ZA9,0,All Case Logic cases share the same flaw. The soft backing on the sleeves tends to collect tiny paricles of dust and dirt. These particles in turn scratch discs repeatedly each time you slide them out of the sleeve. Ive  already ruined about half of my disc collection. Many of my discs will play  fine in the car .which has a great player. but not at home on my CDROM  drive .which isnt as high tech a player.. Thats how I found out I was  scratching all my discs.,1,0,465
A2XF6MGC772ZA9,1421,The sleeves on all Case Logic products have the same flaw. They tend to collect tiny particle of dust. dirt. sand. or whatever that cling to the soft back of the sleeve. These particles in turn serve to scratch your cds  repeatedly over a period of time. There is really no cure to this problem  either. except to keep your cds in their cases. I have ruined about half  of my discs so far. Even some brand new ones that get played more  repeatedly.,1,0,448

A2XHVJXV58MHVL,0,Works as advertised. I needed a replacement for the internal drive on my Lenovo Y510 which had failed. Since the failure on the internal drive had happened before. I didnt want to deal with that again. Having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the OS had been loaded on it. an internal drive would be rarely needed.,5,1,327
A2XIOXRRYX0KZY,11,When Bu0026N designed this one. they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result. what you get is pretty limited.Its a fairly sturdy device by feel. and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and its not difficult to read for extended periods of time .so long as youre not out in the sun anyway. almost all LCD screens perform poorly there..Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default. so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs. and also epubs that dont have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android. you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.Bu0026N gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog. so thats worth checking in on regularly.On the whole. this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semitablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computerstablets up with viruses by being carelessness. Its lockeddown state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use. this is a pretty poor choice. Also. as of mid2013 the later devices .Nook HDHD+. have been radically marked down. so if youre going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise. itd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more fullfeatured.,3,0,1791

A2XP332D0EYYMI,1,I have a Sony MiniDisc Mzr55 and my friends dad told me that the Rio is much better. well im sorry to disapoint you but the product sucks. first of all a minidisc costs less than a rio disc and it has more memory  .Rio=64Mb. MD=650Mb.. The sound quality is the same or better than a Cd.  the MD is easier to record with. you can connect it to anything .Portable  Cd Player. Stereo system. Computer. other MDs and any systems with a line  out.. the Rio can only connect with the computer and you have to download  the songs that you like or transfer them from CD to MP3.thats why i  chose the MD and i got it for a lower price than the Rio.,1,0,639
A2XPFZ834PQ8GN,33,I had been using the lock for my laptop for the past 4 months without any trouble. All of a sudden. today. as I went to pick up the lock. which had been left untouched in the open position overnight with my combination in it. it decided to change combinations by itself. So it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one I had set. I tried so many combinations around mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites. The fact that I even have to try to think of what combination my lock decided to change itself to today makes this a lock I cant rely on!,1,0,586
A2XPZDC06NJIHB,5864,I sat there. feeling stupid. afraid. and lost. How could something so simple be so frustrating? Its a lock... you just insert the lock into the hole and turn with the key. right? Luckily. I emailed Amazon and they refunded. Now its time to Tarantino this story and go back to the beginning...I am about to be traveling internationally quite a bit. and so I thought  hey. why not get a laptop lock for my Macbook .Alum. Late 2008.. so that potential thief passerby might be deterred long enough for me to roundhouse kick them to the noggin?  The Macbook has a place for such a lock. and on this particular model it is located on the left side near the headphone jack. USB ports. etc. It seemed to work for Macbook Pros from reading reviews. why wouldnt it work for my Macbook? Apparently. Kensington and Apple skipped their usual Tuesday morning meeting where they would have discussed how their two products would work together. So instead. Apple just assumed that by making a little lock hole. the Kensington lock would work as well. WRONG. So. so wrong.The Kensington MicroSaver laptop lock will not. I repeat. WILL NOT. work with a Macbook Aluminum Late 2008 for whatever reason. Unless you come across USD20 and decide  hey. whats the best way to waste the fortune Ive just come across?  then this would be the perfect way to do so..Sorry for the overdramatic review..,1,0,1372
A2XQD6IU77PC5F,1,I bought this camera about a year ago. and I have been extremely pleased with it.PROS.Small. fits unobtrusively in your pocketFAST f2.8 lense takes great pictures in low lightSimple user interface. No hasselsit lets you focus on taking the pictures.CONS.No midroll change. This is the one feature I wish it had. but its really a perk rather than an essential. since I only shoot color print film in the camera anyway.APS film is grainier than 35mm film because it is a smaller format. I shoot with 200 speed film to reduce grain .not really the cameras fault. as this is a problem with all APS cameras..I havent had any problems with red eye using this camera. I dont like cameras that zoom because I think you take better composed pictures by physically moving closer to your subject. For the price. you cant get a better deal than this.,5,1,838
A2XQD6IU77PC5F,33,The Rio 500 is a great MP3 player. It has all the features I wanted. pretty good battery life. and is a perfect size.PROS.Basic. easy to use interface.Decent battery life. although not as long as the manufacturer claims.CONS.I hate the software interface. It is slow. unstable and poorly designed. I suggest you use Windows Media Player instead to upload files to the device.As of firmware version 2.15 .availible from ftp.ftp.s3.compubmultimediariorio500_firmware_215.exe.. the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to 64mb. to give it 128mb of total memory. Although this is a decent amount. 128mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaper....There is no Windows XP support with the included software. It will work with XP using 3rd party software. which. consequently. is better than the included software...,4,1,829
A2XQEB2JYDG1L8,22,Nice gray molded patch cable works great if youre computing close to where youll be hooked up to the network.  I use this in my dorm. so Im very close to the plug in.

A2XS4FA5WGO5KR,0,Certainly ebooks have conveniences over printed hardcover and paperback books. If you have an ebook reader and ebooks you dont have to carry 10 or more heavy books with you when traveling to be able to read. However. at least with printed books you can actually own a copy of the book. With ebooks they just give you a license to access the ebook when you buyrent it which they can revoke at any time .Google Amazons remote deletion of George Orwell 1984 book from Kindles. which is why I say the Nook is a crook. The Nook is defective by design and refuse to buy a product that is defective by design. Remove the DRM and maybe then Id be willing to buy it.,3,0,657

A2XW0XUMXI485T,0,I bought this to play movies on my desktop PC. after the PCs internal DVD drive failed. Ive had it for about six weeks now. and have used it about 20 times. It makes me smile every time I use it. because it is so tiny. I keep it in the corner of a drawer. and just take it out when needed. With my desktop. it needs only one port connected to work. and is ready to go in 5 seconds flat. .I briefly tried connecting both cables. and it seemed to be overpowered.. With my old OS. Windows XP. it was truly plug and playset itself up to work with Windows Media Player the first time I connected it. Its manually operated drawer reminds me of a little toy record player I had when I was a child. But it plays movies very wellat least as well as my original driveand seems like it will last as long as Im gentle with it. .If it did fail. Id probably buy another one just like it. to use till its time to replace the whole PC..,4,1,920
A2XW4BKOGYPW6Y,22,OK. if you want your pilot to be more than a nifty gadget. you defintely have to go for this useful keyboard.Great to write Emails during meetings or while on the train.

A2XW9EYLRI4FBB,5657,I returned this and opted for a Nexus7 2013 full fledged google tablet. I am not personally satisfied with the reader being the dominant feature. If I could have loaded more or access more google apps.I think Id have reconsidered. Mine overheated during setup and I had to go to a local store to get it to turn off. I did learn this is a resolveable issue. I also found better prices at the local st ore. If you enjoy B u0026 D predominant reading go for it. I did find a better price at the local store.

A2XWJK6POTDSP7,25,Ive been using this trackball at work for six years and I love it.  I work in a 3D cad program that is primarily controlled by the mouse so it gets worked hard all day. every day.  This track ball never skips a beat and is comfortable to use. I find standard mice to be fatiguing.After more than twelve thousand hours of use the primary left button has given out on me.

A2XYWC3VW8EOU0,0,Ive had my tv mounted for about 3+ months now. Installation was not done by me .I had a guy do it for me.. and I also dont think I wouldve been able to do it myself. I used my own wall mounting screws because the ones provided were not suitable for the wall. Before purchasing. I verified that it could hold my tv. which is a 42  and 42lb plasma. However. when it was mounted I was a bit apprehensive because the arm seemed to droop a bit under the weight. The good news is that it hasnt fallen off the wall as yet!!!! I do plan to invest in a brand thats more sturdy though. All in all. I dont trust how it looks. Ive been monitoring the wallmounted plate everyday to make sure its not starting to come out. and it really hasnt moved. Im just not comfortable with how it appears and Ive decided to not push back or pull forward at all. I just swivel it left or right. Its really great for studio apartment use because Im able to watchtwist it to any part of the room Im in. Thats about the only positive...plus it was cheap. so you do get what you pay for!,2,0,1057

What a difference!It was worth every penny  I spent on this item.,5,1,386
A2Y23OZSZPO2D1,33,PROS. Good audio. easy to program. good features.CONS.However. the FCC will require broadcasters to switch to a digital format in February 2009.  At that time. the radio WILL NO LONGERr receive televison broadcast audio.  Therefore. a good percentage of the radios value is gone!Nationwide. the FCC has reserved 10 weather channel frequencies available.  Usually all 10 cant be received.  This radio only has 5 channels for weather.  In my case. none of those 5 channels contains any weather signals.,3,0,500
A2Y28NNSOPJ8JW,0,The product doesnt work...insert it and it makes noise but doesnt run...doesnt let you hit play as per instructions. stops on its own and ejects without the tape ever moving in the cartridge.

A2Y30AGJIB9RIZ,13,I got this nook for Christmas from my parents. it is light and easy to use. My only issue is that you cant go on the internet with the nook. but it is still really good for reading.

I love the nook and would recomand it to anyone.,4,1,377
A2Y3L86DX4YJJY,0,The mouse is very smooth. and I love the speed.  I use it for work and do some art and publishing.  I turn the wheels to scroll updown leftright and it zooms in and out instead. Checked the install software for the zoom  feature and its supposed to be on the third button. As a previous owner  stated. the third button is a little hard to reach and the options for the  button are not as many as with other mice. The smoothness of the wheels are  a little hard to get used to too.,3,0,480

A2Y6L4KLQMN8RU,0,I purchased the NIK Color Efex Pro 2.0 software as a starter system with the promise  as advertised in the item description  that it would be upgraded to the Standard 3.0 version for free.

A2Y6N9NMQQS20H,11,Very easy to install.  Transfer rate is only about a quarter of whats advertized.  But its OK.  A friend of mine bought a different brand and got about a quarter of the stated performance as well.  I had a problem  with Netscape crashing often. but not sure if this is caused directly by  the product as Windows 98 isnt very stable with networking.  Had some  problems with the internet sharing software. which is a product made by a  third party.  Luckily. Windows 98 has this feature builtin.  Its worth  every penny despite Netscape crashing .Im using IE more often now..,4,1,574

A2Y8NJUWW42LSZ,0,This is still the best MP3 player out in the market. even though it has been a year since Diamond released it. This Special Edition version is great. It comes with 64mb of memory and is expandable to 96mb. Thats over  90 minutes of near cd quality music. Get it while it is still available.  Also. if you have the black Rio 300. you can trade it in for USD100 off the  purchase of this special edition.Pros. Cool Translucent Teal Case.  Expandable to 96mb.  Easy to use software.  One AA battery lasts  13 hours! .  Buttons are conveniently placed  Sound is crystal  clear no skippingCons. Earbud headphones could be better,5,1,623

A2YBJUGE0Q61NZ,22,I was going to use it for in the car for the occasional time it would be good to talk and see what is going on.  Fits in glove box easily. cables make it easy to power up.  Reception is horrible with the antenna included.  It can barley talk to others that are with in 15ft of stopped traffic.Do not have an external antenna so can not say how much that would help.  But at that point I would just install a full size unit.,2,0,423

A2YBV3Z8RIKJTP,1,The ETX90 will likely not disappoint those who have never looked through a telescope before. It provides serviceable views of the moon and five of the planets. These objects are of great interest to the uninitiated and the experienced alike. but there are only six of them. The ETX90 also shows deep space objects it just doesnt show them well. My God. even the Orion Nebula looks dull! It looks better through binoculars. for crying out loud! If you view the Lagoon Nebula through this instrument. you dont know its a nebula at all. It too looks better in binoculars. This isnt a deep sky scope. Not with any eyepiece. Period.Other problems. The field of view is noteworthily narrow  to the point of tunnel vision. .This is a 90mm f13.8 instrument.. The mount allows the scope to jiggle unacceptably  particularly at high power. .Teflon tape in the ALT bearings is helpful but not miraculous..  The finder scope is useless for anything not near the horizon. The focus knob is also useless for anything high in the sky. because one cannot reach it when the scope is in such positions. The Autostar GoTo attachment available for it isnt accurate enough to reliably put objects into the narrow field of view. For similar reasons. it is hard to find objects manually with the Etx90. Most of all. the views of deep space objects are deficient in brightness and contrast.On the plus side. this scope is portable. and many people like it for some reason.I wish I liked the ETX90. I did when I was new to astronomy. I just dont anymore. Buy it and youll take a dim view of the universe.,2,0,1579

A2YEWGSILWV3OB,0,New Nook eReader is definitely better than Kindle.* Expandable storage slot* Excellent support for open book formats* Touch screen* Even smaller and compact.If you are OK with 6 to 8 hours of battery. go for Nook Color and root it. Refurbished ones costs 150170USD. It is an excellent choice inbetween eReaders and Android tablets.Kindle 3G option is attractive for a tablet. but not an eReader.,5,1,395
A2YF1SC3GU89EP,22,I am physically disabled and cannot lift moderate to heavy books. Nor can I bend over to read. A friend purchased the NOOK color for me. It has made the world accessible to me. even on the many days Im stuck in bed.My complaint is the GLARING lack of selection of ebooks on the Bu0026N website. I contacted customer service and made it clear that Amazon has 95% of the ebooks I would like to read. while they have ALMOST NONE.I asked what they were doing to increase their selection. They assured me that they were getting new books all of the time and to check back frequently.The bottom line is that Bu0026Ns selection of ebooks PALES in comparison to Amazons. and it seems they are either too arrogant or apathetic to do something about it.I am also curious how Bu0026N knows WHICH books customers want if there is no format to REQUEST that books be formatted for ereaders. In contrast. Amazon has an easytouse request button so consumers can voice themselves and in so doing. influence the market. Not everyone reads from the bestseller list every moment. if at all!Shame on Bu0026N...and KUDOS to Amazon for being TRULY reader and customerfriendly!,1,0,1153
A2YFETILXM3VPH,110,The system is quick. the books a little more expensive than Amazon. But its well made. beautiful. Im not sure if its waterpoof but I dont plan on finding out.

A2YIUXJ9AVMSKU,25,Bu0026N locked the Nook Tablet since beginning of January to remove sideloading of apps and such. If you were hesitant to purchase one because of that. dont be. I was real dissapointed they did that so I found a way to root mine and now I am running Go launcher along side the Bu0026N interface. I have full access to the android market for tablets and can download and install any apps I want. I voided the warranty by doing this. but If I had not been able to unlock its full potential I would ahve brought it back anyway. so no loss here. As long as its rooted to allow install and modification as you want this becomes a much better device than the Kindle Fire. The hardware. look. and feel is superior. It was the Bu0026N bloatware and restrictions that were holding it back. Now that I have access to other book sites like Touchybooks .which are way cheaper than Bu0026N books. I am really enjoying this with my kid and wife. I also can access cloud services now which means I am streaming my music from Google Music service while I read. That I really love.The only issue I have found so far is when my kid plays the Talking Ben dog app there is no sound. but that is beyond what this is supposed to do so thats not bad.,4,1,1227

A2YJ13OQZ6ZI5W,0,Im somewhat of a techno geek. I like new gadgets and i tend to ask myself  how will this be developed over time. In the case of the nook color they got it right. The size is very good for those used to reading paper backs on the go or in bed just before sleeping. The LCD eye burn has yet to effect me even though Ive already put in 6 straight hour of reading . note. i do keep the backlight level very low .. It is fairly responsive to user inputs. Once you learn how to navigate around it seems intuitive. The magazine format is  a welcomed feature. The reduced battery life over my nook classic will not be an issue. It has lasted 2 days so far with wifi off with the same use pattern Ive had since i got the nook classic .it will need a charge soon though.. Youtube videos work without problems but. hulu is non functional at this point although Im sure future updates will fix that problem. The form factor of the nook color is the 2ND best of any ereader i have held . the nook classic feels better in my hand.. Even though Bu0026N had to make concessions to keep profitability up and the price point down look at what you get.* EPUB .including Non or Adobe DRM.* PDF* Other documents. XLS. DOC. PPT. PPS. TXT. DOCM. XLSM. PPTM. PPSX. PPSM. DOCX. XLX. PPTX* Graphics. JPG. GIF. PNG. BMP* Audio. MP3. AAC* Video. MP4* 8GB built in mem .6000 books.* MicroSD slot add a 32GB microSD card and drastically increase storage capacity* 169 pixels per inch .= better picture quality than the other guy.* Social networking* Kids books with  color and audio* Pandora internet radio* Quickoffice software* The lendme feature* All the above and more for less than USD300It is a superior offering to those that love to read and want the little extras at a reasonable cost. I highly recommend this product. It will only get better with time.,5,1,1832

A2YKN8E68KVMZL,0,We have the old Nook reader. which we love. We purchased this Nook at target for the same price as Barnes and Noble and Amazon.This Nook is smaller. which is nice. It has a built in light. which is really nice. And. it is touch screen. which is awesome!The only flaw I see thus far is that you cant resize the letters. Apparently the letters are a standard size. I assume because of the size of the screen? Anyway. I would like to make them smaller so that I can read more before turning the page. However. that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new Nook tremendously.,4,1,591
A2YL4R66S69HRR,0,I received my new Nook Tablet today. charged it. and with great anticipation went to find my favorite magazine. The Economist.

Android. and even on the Blackberry. I called tech support for help and was told that. even though this is an Android device. the standard Android Apps have been disabled. I was told that I would have to buy a duplicate subscription through the Bu0026N store if I want to read The Economist on my Nook. It seemed like an absurd statement. so I asked to speak with a supervisor. To my astonishment he made. with an apparently straight face. the same absurd statement.Thats the Bu0026N product Ill ever buy!.,1,0,827

A2YLAJ925HZ601,34,I have three Kindle 7 s. .Fire and 2 Fire HDs.  Love em all.  However. this case doesnt fit them all.  And it does have a few weak spots...unless Im not using it correctly.  The new Kindle Fire HD 7 has its Power button under the device instead of at the top center as before.  Therefore. this power on location makes it hard to reach under the tiny opening on the case.  Too bad the case designers didnt just drill a hole thru the case where the button was located. then we could use our Stylus to poke thru the hole to turn on the power.  But as the saying goes. when you got a toy you like to play with. you can always find a way to make it work for you.,4,1,657

A2YN55LHR0ZR75,0,As is usually the case. you get what you pay for.  The quality of the 75507 is not poor but it is clearly not high quality either.  Unlike the more expensive units. this one is not water resistant.  The signal quality  and strength is good and the range is about 1.5 miles in open terrain.  I  found the battery cover difficult to remove without removing the belt clip  first.  And. contrary to the specifications and editorial review. the  Rogerbeep function is off by default and must be turned on manually each  time the radio is turned on.  According to Midlands tech support. this is  a design change for which a change to the owners manual was not deemed  necessary.  On balance. the units are worth the price but no more.  As for  Amazon.com. the product was delivered in just a few days. well packaged and  in excellant condition.  Whether or not you buy this product. Amazon.com is  5 star.,3,0,899
A2YNQWNJ4CLNX6,3132,After doing some looking. I purchased this product.  It does work well. and the quantity enclosed is well worth the money.  Just be careful of your software program so that you dont end up following the arrows on the individual sheets. and have the printouts being upside down.  This was my own fault for not reading before I got started.,4,1,338
A2YNQWNJ4CLNX6,116,I purchased this cable since the printers now require one. and do not come with them.  It connected to the printer as well as the computer with no problem. and works well.  My only problem was not knowing that in order to use the scanner with the printer. this cable will not work.  I needed a usb .square. on the printer end. and a parallel port on the other end.  This is not a problem with the cable. just probably lack of knowledge on my end??,3,0,447
A2YO9JH2HKYG54,34,This drive works well from the get go.  Install is nearly effortless.  I recommend it to anyone that needs an easy backup for modest sized files.  Ive got a burner but I still use this toy because it works fast u0026amp  easy.  Theres no formatting issue.,4,1,255
A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,33,I love this camcorder. Why? Its easy to use. has excellent picture and sound quality. isnt bulky .even though its much bigger than the stuff they have out now.. and has a lot of features. Yes. to use this camcorder today entails using cassettes as opposed to builtin disc drives. but you wouldnt know the difference in overall quality. Furthermore. its all too easy to just burn your cassette footage onto DVD anyway. I particularly like the fading feature. as well as all of the goodies such as sepia. black and white. pastel. overlap. bounce. stripe. wipe. solar. slim. wide. etc. Oh. and theres nightshot as well. Id put my money on this camcorder being superior to many modernday camcorders. Some of the newer camcorders havent been perfected. and suffer in such areas as tint. for instance. Finally. the steadyshot feature on this model is truly remarkable. and will prevent poor cameramen from ruining your video if the camcorder should happen to get into their hands. Ive had this camcorder for 12 years now. and love it. Sony is a great manufacturer of camcorders.,5,1,1072
A2YQHMDUS67VDC,33,I have a Sony VHS player that had seen very little use yet I managed to apparently ruin by carelessly slotting a home tape inside which ants had made their lair .life in the tropics!..  Debated cleaning the contaminated heads. but fearing ruining the device I ordered this wet cleaner cartridge instead.  It wiped clean the contaminated heads in one single pass and the playback is as good as new.,5,1,397
A2YRD71DJ6XWV3,12,Np complaints. seem to work as expected.  It definitely saves you money from constantly buying this type of batteyr which can be costly on the long run.  Worth the buy..,4,1,169
A2YSIFLYY2D0MI,0,As always Iomega has the best products.  They always make a reliable product.  They have great support for their products and this is no exception.This is an extremely fast 2GB drive that is faster than 90%  hard drives out there.,5,1,230
A2YSLAI9DJ32I9,1515,Bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my Nook Tablet. Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine. After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again. This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again. Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet.so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead.,2,0,433
A2YSMIXYMDSZ0M,0,I bought this recently and used it on a trip to Nepal. The zoom allowed me to focus in on the animals well. while still letting me take in the full breadth of the Himalayas.  The flexibility of the lighting options .red  eye. night flash. red eye and night. etc.. allowed me to take pictures in  many variations of light.  The 3 different view options allowed me to frame  the picture in the way that best suited the variety of my subjects. The  film is easy to come by even in Nepal and simple to load. The colors were  amazing. Its a great camera to take with you. simple to operate. and still  allows you to get quality pictures.,5,1,632
A2YSRFLSQMXBCT,9191,You cannot go wrong with this CB.I use it in my 4x4 while wheeling with friends. hunting. atvs. and on trips in the truck.It is truly a portal. powerful. functional. versatile. CB.I would definatelly recommend to buy this. Battery life is great. easy battery changer included. and the vehicle adapter is a great function.,5,1,321
A2YSRNPSMG5460,12,Radio worked great for first couple of trips and then the car adaptor stopped working suddenly. Handheld still works but the car adaptor was a much better setup for me. Planning on buying a Uniden in car unit now and keep the handheld as a back up. Get what you pay for I guess. Will contact midland to see about a replacement for the car adaptor.,3,0,347
A2YSY26ZVMNNV2,1,If you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok. but for modems and internet connections. your speed will go dooooooown to 9600 or even less.,2,0,197
A2YTEOZZCNG2GE,2223,I know it is a competitor. but Nook HD weighs 11.1 oz.  It is a light weight reader and comfortable to use.,4,0,107
A2YTN1433TCSQU,12,Followed directions and nothing. for the price did not want to bother with returning so threw away.  Purchased one from the store and worked fine.,1,0,146
A2YUQWU3S535UL,11,You may know that Motorola has a plug on their headsets that is a little longer than standard. so you cant use off the shelf headsets.  I bought these so that my walkie talkies could be used while bike riding .I am in a tropical developing world country.. so cell phones are expensive..  The headsets work perfectly and allows the VOX feature to be used on the radios. thus keeping both hands free .nice for hiking or working..I do wish they were more ruggedly constructed. but I really cannot complain... they were a pretty good price and meet my needs.,4,1,554
A2YWXBOUXTB78T,1,I currently own this 24 MD case. and while It provides the portability that Mini Discs are all about. it only holds 24 MDs.... If they want us to believe MDs are more portable than CDs. then why are they making it so  hard to carry them with us??  Still. it is the best case out there thusfar.  and caselogic is always a safe bet.,3,0,330
A2YX0Z6RHA8Y2H,1923,I need to buy my third power cord within 1 year.  I refuse to do so.  The Nook power cord is NOT designed to last and causes nothing but problems ... its either discharging or not charging.  And. Im dismayed that I cannot buy a Nook external charger to charge my Nook while on a 3 week vacation.  Im giving up the Nook and going to a Kindle Fire.,1,0,346
A2YXMN40D7WTGP,0,This was a replacement for a Jensen CDPortable I had.  The Jensen never  skipped once and it went through 5 months of constant shock therapy .I used  it to work out..  Unfortunately due to leaving the unit in my car on a 100  degree day .130 degrees in my car.. it melted the top.So I bought this  .without the car kit. because I thought since my Jensen had 40 second  antiskip. that this would be the same.  It was not.Listening to alot  of converted MP3 files .to WAV.. it would have problems reading them to the  point I could not get through one song without it freezing.  Even when  playing the regular CDs it would skip once in a while.  Not good for 40  second antiskip.The sound is worse as well.  It is obvious that  Panasonic uses the worst opamps in the industry because the output is low  and without highefficiency headphones. you just dont get alot of volume.  The volume you do get is grainy and the soundstage was worse than my  Jensen. even a Kenwood unit I had for 3 years before that.  Strange because  Technics .Panasonics sister company. makes some good CD players with their  MASH DA converters.I recommend that you stay away from this model and  invest 10 more dollars on a Sony or a Jensen .if you can find  it..Rating. C,2,0,1245
A2YYETB6L8FQDN,11,I have had my Nook HD for thirteen months and it has gone crazy....switching screens and bouncing all over the place. Erased and deregistered device and started all over. That didnt solve the problem. Called Nook support and all they could offer me since warranty had run out was to buy another one that had been returned for USD101.00. The only guarantee they would give is if I purchased a warranty for USD34. Buyer beware!,1,0,425
A2YYH2I9S9TUCM,0,and these mounts are the best....I have friends with different types and when they see what I have they wished that they had bought this type instead.....it is solid. and I have all angles........I mounted it on a sturdy board and then to the wall as I live in a log home....,5,1,275
A2YYY471977B0S,0,My place in WV is a 90 mile drive from Washington DC.  This radio brings in DC FM stations.  I like to listen in the garden.  My earlier strategy was to acquire old boom boxes from thrift stores. but with these. the signal frequently went fuzzy.  On an inpulse. I bought a nice digital Eton radio for excess of USD200.  It was a nice radio and fairly sensitive. but it had features I did not need  It seemed more design for Short Wave listening than for FM.  When I acquired the GE Super radio. I did side by side comparison.  The GE was better and cost a fraction of what the Eton cost.  The Eton went back to the store.I love the sound.  One quibble.  The batteries keep falling out.  The battery compartment opens too easily.,4,1,728
A2YZ13TS1OAITC,12,Excellent buy!  Im very pleased with the overall performance of the radio.  Its reception and tone quality is excellent.  If youre looking for an anolog .slide rule dial. AMFM radio without the bells and whistles. this is the radio to buy.  Highly Recommend!,5,1,258
A2YZLWQCPP70DU,22,I was expecting what was pictured. NOT an extension cord. I needed what was pictured for connecting my monitor to my computers power supply. Instead. what I got was this...C2GCables to Go 03115 18 AWG Outlet Saver Power Extension Cord .NEMA 515R to NEMA 515P.. Black .6 feet1.82 Meters.,1,0,286
A2Z0FNHK2G7BZ9,0,I was skeptical about purchasing this camera.  But. boy Oh boy. when I got it. I plugged it in and the picture was clear and I was amazed at its capabilities.  It is also a close range camera and it does well on long  range video shots.  I mounted the camera on the back of a basketball hoop  at my college. NMSU. and ran a 100ft USB cable from the camera to my  laptop.  The picture was great!  I could make out numbers on jerseys as I  watched the game from behind the wall at the booth I was working at.  This  camera is a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone.  Knibb High  football rules!,5,1,600
A2Z0MLIH040PQX,1818,I was anxious to get this and play around.  However there was no instruction manual included.  You have to download it from the web.  Ive never had a smartphone or tablet before so I cant compare this to anything  however just getting around wasnt very intuitive.  I dont think this would be a good gift for anyone that has very limited computer experience.  Im just astonished that they would .in an effort to save money. omit an instruction manual.Ive had mine for about 3 days now and I can download apps. play games and access the web. So far Im very happy with my experience.  But I do wish there were more apps available.  Im sure I have alot more to learn about this gadget.  Im going to go to my local Bu0026N store and hopefully Ill find someone to help me out.,4,1,770
A2Z2O2F2ONKIK9,77,I considered purchasing this cable because of its discription as being for a Sony Bravia TV. Instead. I got a cheap generic 28 awg cable from china or somewhere in Asia. The resolution is terrible and will not always work. I had to order another cable on ebay. I want to return it for a full refund but have no means of contacting the seller through Amazon. I am very hesitant about ordering from amazon again.,1,0,410
A2Z2ZXHLJ5AK0F,2,After the i key on my old Mitsumi 101 keyboard died after 5 years of abuse. it was time for me to buy a new one.I went to a local store and tested various keyboards that were for sale. The Logitech stood out for me  since it.1. Had a good price2. Had a name on it that I recognized.3. It didnt have all of those extra keys on it .such as the key to  adjust the volume. to run a web browser. etc.. I would have rather done  without the 3 extra W*ndows keys. but keyboards without those keys are  nearly impossible to come by.4. It has a key response that I like. As  the reviewer below says. the tactile feedback is not as much when  compared to many other keyboards out there.5. The wrist rest fits well  and snaps tight on to the keyboard. Im glad one was included since the  front edge of the keyboard is a bit curvy. and my old foam rest probably  would not match up with it very well.,4,1,888
A2Z2ZXHLJ5AK0F,88,This model is quite slow. but its not Iomegas fault. but just a result of it using the parallel port. The usage of the parallel port also uses CPU cycles. so while the thing is copying data. you might not be able to  anything else but watch the egg timer.Spend your money on a CDR  instead. A CDR drive might cost a little bit more. but the media is MUCH  cheaper. holds MUCH more data. and is more durable than the Zip  format.If you must buy a Zip drive. dont buy the parallel port model.  its far too slow for impatient people .like me..,2,0,540
A2Z3MMBWUB703C,44,I researched the difference between Nook and Kindle for months and ultimately choose Nook. The device itself is nice. I like the size. the screen view and the touch screen. However. since the first night it arrived Ive had trouble with it freezing. After this happened several times. I called tech support to find out what they could do. Initially they said theyd replace the battery but then retracted saying they couldnt because they couldnt access the warranty details. They said they would get this information from the seller and I should call back in a couple days. This pattern went on for weeks. They never got the information and kept putting me off. Finally they told me they would replace it and a new one was on its way. But of course I never got it and when I called to check. they started the lies and denial all over again. I am HUGELY disappointed and shocked that Bu0026N doesnt stand behind its product. It is like they are just wasting my time until the warranty runs out. Ive have had great success working with Amazon to replace other products. I regret the choice of Nook. Dont buy it!,1,0,1107
A2Z40NTXROGF8H,2430,I bought this microphone thinking that it would be good for many applications. When i got home. i plugged it in and it was a huge disapointment. I had bought it for voice recognition. I had read good  reviews on it and thats why i bought it in the first place. When i tried it  with my voice recognition software. it only had 40 percent comphrehension.  It said it wasnt compatible. then other voice recognition software had  hardly any comprehension at all. i tried using it to do commands on my PC.  The only thing this was good for was when i used it in sound recorder. To  those who want to buy this. i suggest that you dont. What good is a mic  that is only good for one application?,2,0,688
A2Z49MUOZ89OGZ,1418,I bought a pair of the speakers but could not get the transmitter to power up.  Suspecting a bad connector. I returned the set to Radio Shack.  I tried all possible combinations with 2 transmitters and 2 power supplies. but could not get either transmitter to sustain power.  Seems like poor quality control to me.  The Radio Shack salesperson admitted that they never got them to work in the store.,1,0,399
A2Z4CMIWL0PDH0,1313,I have tried everything that I could think of to use this but to no avail. Honestly its probably my fault but I have tried.When I scan the card it shows that it is indeed a 4GB device but I cant get my maps to load on it?,2,0,221

A2Z6I6OOP8QPKL,11,i got this particular card to add into my kodak easy share camera since any other sd card i bought before would not format ...was disappointed that this card also did not work no matter wich way i tried to format it...i like the sd card an am using for another device,4,1,267
A2Z7LZ3O5YX7H1,0,These headphones work really well.  The sound quality is the best.  I would definitely recommend them.  The price is unbeatable.,5,0,128
A2Z7NVK6HRVG6A,22,I bought the simple onetouch Nook ereader and. although I love ereaders. this has been an exercise in frustration.While reading a book. the Nook will suddenly freeze up. you cant page forward or backwards AND if you want to try the old reliable turn it off then back on trick you learn that you can turn it off only with much difficulty. Another annnoyance is sometimes when touching the screen to turn the page. a word will be highlighted and will continue to be highlighted until you turn the Nook on u0026 off .if you succed in turning it off. this is NOT to be confused with the normal highlighting feature.I went to the local Bu0026N store several times and was unable to get help. Once I was told that if you didnt unplug the Nook from the charger immediately after reaching 100% charge. the above problems would occur.  Another time. I was told that these complaints were frequent with the One Touch Nook but not the color Nook. I was also discouraged from returning it to Bu0026N customer service...So. I have chalked the USD139 up to lessons learned and have bought an IPad. I just tried to turn off my Nook and. of course. could not get it to power off.Ann,1,0,1166
A2Z8UHV4XOW526,24,This CD changer has made me want to never by any product by Harman Kardon or its parent JBL EVER!  Mine suffered a malfunction after less than a year of use that would cost me more to repair than to simply replace.  That is inexcusable in my opinion.  I saw a response by a Harman Kardon rep before on this site saying that if the CD player was made after a certain date then the problem wouldnt show up.  Mine was made before this date.  Question. why was it still on a retailers shelf?  Why wasnt a recall done?  That would have saved me a lot of time. trouble. and money.  I would have had it serviced under the warrenty but I mail ordered it from the States while I was in Japan.  However. I feel its ridiculous to have to have such major repairs made to a CD changer after less than 1 year.  Denon DCM370 here I come.  Its a cheaper. 5disc changer. with HDCD. and cant possibly be any less reliable!,1,0,904
A2Z920GEXYEPEY,57,Im not impressed at all.,1,0,24
A2Z9CSFKY23V09,28,Bought one few months back...n i guess it is a gud investment for costly equipments...as other reviewers pointed out...it is quite bulky....the prongs always stick out.i am not able to carry it around in my laptop bag.....moreover for those of u. who travel a lot....NOTE. this things works only at 120V that means it will simply blow out when u will use it in countries which have higher voltage ratings.....APC do have other products which work at higher ratings tooUpdate.5 Years on and this thing is still working for me,4,1,524
A2Z9CSFKY23V09,33,I bought this one few months back for my Toshiba laptop.......the case is quite strong thou a lill small for my 15u0026quot Toshiba Satellite.....but on the other side this bag is quite strong and sturdy...and is compact too....if u r thinking that u can also put ur files n other documents in the case itself along with ur laptop then this is not the bag for u.....Pros. Very Strong. Good Quality fabric n zippers. Water Proof. Very Light and just the right size. Smart looking tooCons. Wont recommend for 15u0026quot Laptops. wont carry ur books or big files....overall i think this a very good bag for its price.,4,1,615
A2Z9F2OKNMRJVD,11,This thing was okay for my 6 year old. but I went for the HD at least for my 10 year old.  The charger cable has a habit of not working. too so you might want to stock up on some extra cables from Barnes n Noble while theyre still selling them.,3,0,244
A2ZB6BETR6IC27,0,I have to agree with other users that this is a great product. BUT its not as practical as you may think. A USB sync cable is a better idea. Talk about convenience. Secondly. the cable is too long! Who needs 3 .or 2. or cable to connect a Palm to a Laptop  computer? The reason why Im writing this review is because I havent been able to find a USB sync cable. I called Palm. there is none available. I visited the stores. there is none available. Will anybody have the brilliant .and obvious. idea of creating this device?! I also write this review for those of us who use laptop computers with USB ports and dont want anything to do with legacy hardware.,2,0,656
A2ZBW1GVAXYGNI,17,It probably would have been good. but the wrong item was sent to me.....and I ended up having to go to a local retailer and purchase another one that would work....the installer was not gonna be able to come.back.for several weeks and if they came back I would have had to pay another trip charge.Therefore I wasnt able to use the mounting support that was sent and there is too much involved to sending it back....Probably will not order items this way again....,1,0,463
A2ZCP7NS4WQAGH,1,I dont have anything to compare it to. I got it for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.,4,0,95
A2ZCW3Y1AB7261,0,I like to think that I am at least fairly competant and can follow simple instructions. I purchased two advent speakers neither of these items would work. I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with tech support .Thompson provides the support for these units. the tech support was very patient and helpful but we still could not get the units to work. I returned both units and subsituded with a set of acoustic research wireless which work flawlessly.,1,0,451
A2ZD0Y4SI8MOZ0,11,The Palm V arrived in great condition from the seller. however. was not able to sync with our computer. very disappointed.,1,0,122
A2ZD3O6N5RY96D,11,The Item is not a Jabra cable. Its regular cheap data cable with micro port. Their cable is very short .~39 in.. which is twice shorter of original cable size  so you are unable to use it in the car. I contacted seller  they blame that its as designed and if I dont like it  they will send return instruction.,1,0,309
A2ZE9DN5LNZWMT,0,I bought the original Logitech Trackman Marble somewhere around a year ago and loved it. So. I jumped at the chance to u0026quotupgradeu0026quot to the new TrackMan Marble FX Trackball last week.Even though the design is  reminiscent of the original Trackman Marble. actually using the mouse feels  completely different. and not in a good way...I found the buttons  intuitive and even after custommapping them. I find that their locations  require me to u0026quotreachu0026quot or stop what Im doing to find what used to  be quite intuitive to me. Not good at all. I have mediumsized hands .for a  woman. and so I dont think its just that the mouse is to big for my  hands.I also find that my right hand cramps up painfully after using the  mouse for a few hours. This is very disturbing. considering that Ive had  issues with carpal tunnel syndrome a few years ago and this is the first  time symptoms have flared up in about three years.I boxed this mouse up  and pulled out the old original Trackman marble and surprisingly enough.  the pain went away. If you buy this one. keep the receipt until youve used  it for awhile and are certain that itll work for you.,1,0,1165
A2ZE9DN5LNZWMT,4725,I have used this camera extensively for over a year. I use theMavica almost exclusively for pictures at my web site. Many are shrunkfor quick download times. but you can still see the output quality.After using the MVCFD73 for this long there are many pros and cons that I have come up with.Pros.1  easy to use2  nice LCD viewer for scrolling through previous shots3  floppies are a very convenient reusable mediumCons.1  LCD viewer gets scratched easily2  Viewer LCD hard to see in very strong outdoor light .a better camera would have an interchangeable regular viewfinder AND an LCD viewer.3  Flash always seems too strong  a lot of red eye incidents indoors4  Has a hard time focusing in low light5  Floppies. while convenient. are FAR too small for high res pics. Why Sony hasnt made a Zip Drive or Super Disk drive version is beyond me.In the future I will buy another camera that clears up the problems listed above. It probably wont be a Sony since Sonys pushing proprietary media in their future digital cameras.If you want this camera for the long haul Id suggest doing a little more homework and being fully aware of the 5 problems I mentioned above before buying this one.,3,0,1184
A2ZEQCSK94RZI8,1121,I recently purchased the Advent AW870 Wireless Powered Speakers and found them to be very difficult to tune properly.  The signal would drift in and out with alot of distortion.  Then I picked up RCAs .WSP200. new wireless  speakers with their transmitter and speakers having 3 preset 900 MHz  channels.  This was a snap to get up and running and worked great.  I was  even able to tune the advent speakers to the RCA tranmitter very quickly.  I came to the conclusion that the Advent transmitter is much more difficult  to use and I would not recommend the Advent series because of the  transmitter.,2,0,600
A2ZF76SJ1ETH9C,2828,After playing around with other brands and several trips to the discount stores. Ive settled on the MicroTalk 2. Car to car on the freeway. I get about 34 mile range .pretty good for 500mW.. I get about a mile from the  car to the house. Compared to a 4Watt hand held CB. this kicks butt.,5,1,288
A2ZGI3YYFGZL98,1516,Major gripes for the Rio500 seem to be headphones. software and Audible.com support. Just got mine in and immediately I updated the Rio500s firmware to 2.11 .it ships with 1.04. to allow for Audible.com  support and support for 64MB flash cards. Next you must download  Audible.coms AudibleManager  the software that ships with the Rio doesnt  upload the Audible.com sound files themselves. The software .RioPort. was  my biggest complaint... after I registered the 2.x version that comes with  the Rio500 .gotta register the 2.x version FIRST.. I upgraded to the 3.x  version. Works okay... but some tracks seem to be getting stuck in the  middle of downloading tracks to the MP3 player .RioPort just freezes up..  Never tested the headphones... heard so many bad things about them...  immediately ditched em and got a nice pair of Sony earbuds. Sounds great  to me. Sound quality and hardware. very nice. Software and documentation.  needs work.,4,1,947
A2ZGSHBH47H9KL,89,I was very excited to receive my jensen remote control.  It was pretty easy to program. nice backlighting. But could not get it to work with my denon avr900. which rendered it useless to me. So sad. I sent it back to  amazon. which very kindly paid the shipping.  I am still looking for a good  remote for around the same price. The search continues.....,3,0,354
A2ZH26QW2ZPK2C,612,I use this in the car when driving long distances through major metropolitan areas  listen to the truckers discuss road conditions.  I can hear pretty good with this.  Talk power may be limited  even though Ive got a good roof K40 antenna with a good SWS.  Acess to squelch and volume is is a little trickly while driving.  I wish this unit had adaptive squelch so that I dont need to constantly fiddle with it.,4,1,411
A2ZHSHIVYKUFQQ,0,This is a great power strip.  As many reviewers have pointed out. the design allows you to use ALL the sockets. as the sockets on standard rectangular power strips are often so close together that a plug for one device may block one or more sockets next to it.  It is also the most stable power strip that I own. as the round configuration keeps it solid on the floor exactly where you put it. even on carpet  instead of leaning. lifting. and sliding around like many rectangular power strips .another plus that other reviewers have noted..  I also like the angled plug that plugs the power strip into the wall.  This allows the cord to point on an angle toward the floor. which helps conceal the cord and keep the power strip stable.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the cord that connects the power strip to the wall socket is too long.  I would have been happier with with an 18 to 24 inch cord. as opposed to several foot length of this cord.  Having all this extra cord to some extent defeats the purpose of what is otherwise an unobtrusive and compact power strip.,4,1,1091

A2ZJ6GE01FO6P5,0,Lightweight. easy to use. came earlier than expected. Only issues with Nook vs Kindle is the price tag of books versus Kindles price. Even the classics were pricey where a Kindle were free to 99 cents if at all.,4,1,211
A2ZJD940GUJ23E,0,Pics were awful. it hogs batteries. unlike most digital cams theres no power adapter included.  Save some more money and buy something decent.  I had tried a Casio QV220 about two years ago it was a lot better than this  and it was priced about USD80 more than this two years ago. I would have  thought two years time would have slashed the prices and this one would be  about the same quality... WRONG... this camera does not worth its weigh to  carry with you.  Pictures are really bad.,1,0,488

A2ZJIHSRFBW6MH,34,I found the camera to be extremely easy to operate. the compact size will be excellent for a purse or coat pocket.  The instructions should be carefully read its a small. 156page booklet in 5 languages.  The Troubleshooting section .p. 124. has back references to the instructions.  The purpose of buying this model was to have a simple. pointandshoot  camera for my wife to use. but have a few fun features for myself.  Both of  us are very pleased with the choice.,5,1,466
A2ZJIHSRFBW6MH,3435,I have owned the Palm V for over two months. having given up my 30year WeekataGlance usage.  It took a little getting used to at first. but after 2 months of going paperless. Im totally hooked.  EVERYTHING goes  into that machine.  It is so intuitive to use that the learning curve was  almost flat.  Some things take a little study. but thats the investment  one needs to make this is no 4banger.  At 6.2 ounces with the hard case.  its not too bad in the shirt pocket. but is unnoticed in a suit coat  pocket. and fits nicely in a briefcase or glove compartment.  I havent  submitted it to any abuse such as handling it roughly. dropping it. or  getting it wet. thus no performance problems so far.  Dont forget to order  the OReilly publication. u0026quotPalmPilot. The Ultimate Guide .2nd  Edition.u0026quot  Lots of good instructions to argment the instructions that  come with the Palm V.,5,1,894
A2ZJJAC7FLZPQI,2627,Average Performer. 1. I dont link the way its installed and you have to leave a window open to use it. You need an antenna the most in the bad weather and if you cant use it when you need it the most. then what is the point in buying it. 2. Clarity is OK for the price.,2,0,269
A2ZKB1615DJANF,718,I bought this deck to convert a few of my old cassettes to digital.  I plugged it directly into the Audigy 2 soundcard line in and used Audition at high resolution to record.  I was very pleasantly surprised at its ability to make a good tape sound almost like a professionally converted CD .with a little expected experimentation all around. with no audible or visual .in Audition. tape hiss.  On very used tapes .or tapes of tapes. it performed a bit better than I expected but nothing will be perfect in these cases.  The native Pioneer NR and is big a plus.  It works well on all tapes.  On good tapes it works very well.  I am happy with my purchase.,4,1,655
A2ZL9X00FS2WZI,11,The ink ribbon of the startup TZ tape I received with the labeler got stuck and tore. thereby wasting the complete tape.  The ink ribbon for an additional tape I had ordered with the labeler also got stuck and tore. thereby wasting the remaining tape.  I am trying one more buy. but if the ink ribbon or any part of the tape tears again. I do not think I will buy any more tapes.,1,0,379

A2ZOM2FKK2ICHR,0,I have used this cam a lot for doing meetings .with netmeeting. and the picture is very clear.  Also I take still pictures for my webpage.  Again they come out clear.  The only problem that I have had is that sometimes it  locks up and if you want to use it again you will have to reboot.  Other  then that its great!  Just because the price is low doesnt mean a thing.,4,1,369
A2ZOM53ZAW172J,3838,Well. I personally didnt buy this product off of Amazon.com. but I do own it. so its all good.  I was really surprised at the quality of the sound  from this product.  Its an excellent buy.  For the price. I really dont  think that you can get a better deal.  One of the things I like best is the  ease of use. espically w the Compulink system.  If you have a JVC amp w a  remote you can control the CD player too.  Also. if you buy this. use the  digital out feature.  The sound quality is much better than from the RCA  jacks.,5,1,528
A2ZP7F2XXKGUCR,3637,I had looked for a replacement radiocd player. also made by Phillips.  That product is no longer manufactured and I found this Phillips system.  PRO. Very good sound considering its speaker sizes takes up little shelf space good radio reception.  CON. Both speakers are lightweight .good. poorly designed .bad.. I have them unattached to the main unit. and they tip over easily the remote is a great feature but you have to press the buttons down forcefully to make them work.  I would recommend this Phillips system and Im glad I bought it.,4,1,541

A2ZR0IZBIPQUPY,0,I am blind. This device enables me to quickly and easily label my files. CDs. other documents. spices. and other goods. The labeling process is quick and easy. and the backup process works nicely as well. The built in speaker is loud and relatively clear.I list the downsides below.1. In my opinion. the device is over priced. It is essentially a recorder with a small built in scanner. As such. it should cost only USD50 or USD60.2. I think that the extra label packs are also overpriced. As far as I can tell. they are little more than paper labels with printed codes on them. As such. USD30 per pack seems like an extremely high price for a pack of only a few hundred labels.3. As far as I can tell. you cannot use the labels for this device to label clothing.Conclusion.Despite the downsides that I listed above. the device works quite well. and I am very satisfied with it. I would highly recommend it to any other blind or visually impaired person who is looking for a highly efficient labeling system.,4,1,1008
A2ZR9GVMZ763UR,66,The instructions dont mention Windows XP. The web site mentions it. barely. but wihhout instructions. I wasted an hour trying to do it myself. then an hour with tech support. Finally got it working. but only because I know about IP addresses. network configuration. etc. I imagine it would be easy to setup if they bothered to provide instructions for WIndows XP. and it may be easy with older versions of Windows. But XP users should stay away. And wonder why NetGear cant provide any attempt at instructions a year after XPs release.Once I got it working. it works fine. The only hassle was setting it up.,2,0,607
A2ZR9V069NQZHB,910,The ends were bent so it only got 2 stars but other than that it still worked. Very inexpensive but if youre looking for a good cable then you might want to look somewhere else. The cord was much shorter than the original Samsung Galaxy S3 cord.,2,0,245
A2ZRH4HCTSU1QX,0,I  was very happy with the performance of this SD card on my Samsung Galaxy s4. I never had an issue until yesterday. I went to look for a pic to show a friend and the SD card wasnt showing up in the gallery. I performed all the usual things we do when technology starts acting crazy. I took out the card. put it back in. restarted the phone. put the card in my card reader at home. NOTHING. It breaks my heart to say that I lost 2.500 pictures. .Yes. I take a lot of pictures. lol. Major sad face on this one. ..,1,0,513
A2ZRVJOS1L0JMN,1415,I was not happy with this buyer at all.  He only gives you seven days to return a product.  He does not guarantee the products.

A2ZS4VX737A1Z1,12,Best take a good look at your phones accessory jack.  My wifes LG300G does NOT have a mini USB connector.  What is shown in this photo appears to be mini USB.  Everywhere Ive looked. no one has a data cable for the LG300G model.  The manual mentions changing the ringtones only through upload to Net 10 which then sends it to your phone via a text message.  We havent tried this yet.  The manuals accompanying this model really suck for information on how to use the options.,1,0,475
A2ZS7J8JNMI78B,0,Ok product  erects nicely but you do lose a bit of quality  Great for viewing land objects through telescope .daughter loved it as she could spy on people nicely.  easier to move telescope but loss of quality too great for astonomy purposes. So think on use before you buy,3,0,272
A2ZSFXYD1BLVB0,22,I really love the versions of Internet Explorer and the Outlook Inbox on this machine.  I use them over land lines and my cell phone.  My notebook stays home more. and Im a more comfortable mobile communicator.,5,1,210
A2ZSYNN8ZJJ2R4,34,BEING A PREVIOUS OWNER I KNEW WHAT I COULD EXPECT. THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ALLOW YOU TO REALLY MAKE GOOD USE OF THIS DICTIONARY. IT IS COMPACT AND FITS INTO A HANDBAG QUITE READILY.  I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SAME OR BETTER FROM THIS NEW DICTIONARY. THE PREVIOUS DICTIONARY LASTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.  I WAS THE FIRST IN MY SCRABBLE GROUP TO OWN THIS TYPE OF SCRABBLE DICTIONARY. AND MADE QUITE A HIT WITH THE PLAYERS. THANKS FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR ALL SCRABBLE PLAYERS.,5,1,490

A2ZUNCI13N2OUL,33,The Garmin GPS II. II Plus. and III are all excellent products.  I use the II Plus often when boating at night or on hikes.  Learning how to use it was easy.  Accuracy is as good as any personal commercial product .military  models are better..  One disadvantage of the II Plus is it is not  waterproof.  That is the only reason why it was not ranked with 5 stars.  Otherwise excellent product for remote locations and boating at night.  Appeared easier to learn and use than other GPS.  These products work  anywhere in the world!,4,1,531
A2ZUO6AATAL93X,1515,Works well. Sound quality is clear. Didnt want to mount anything permanent. I used it in my truck with a magnet mount roof antenna. Probably could have gotten away with the just rubber duck antenna for the off roading trip I was on.  Others had the same radio and they worked just fine with the rubber one.,4,1,306
A2ZVNM8J2Q4HQT,0,Works great. after all how difficult could it be to make a good floppy drive.I was thinking of getting a used one. but this one is cheaper and gives peace of mind. compared it with sony external usb and found this one cheaper. very sturdy. dropped couple of times but it still works. very plug and play. never gave me a chance to complain. works comparaeable to my sony vaio integrated floopy drive,5,1,398
A2ZW90ZAH2VB1U,1417,Many people who enjoy this player seemed like they had never operated one before. Of course the ESP would work if you u0026quotsmack it or even drop itu0026quot.

A2ZWPLINHIK3DS,510,Once I replace its crippled version of Android OS. and replaced it with a Cyanogenmod version of Android. I found the tablet to be very capable. The only negative is that it is a little on the heavy side.,4,1,204
A2ZZAM4LFM4IE1,0,Very good product for those with a Nook book collection. Works well with apps. All google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera.  I brought two units for my children and there are lots of apps and books for them. The Nook HD will read certain books allowed. My two units ended up being defective and kept crashing. Was able to return both with no problems.,4,1,378
A2ZZPE4TLKBIA9,0,I will never buy another piece of junk from Harman Kardon again.  I bought this receiver a while ago. but just got around to setting it up.  After one hour of use. the surround sound circuit blew out and I was left with nothing but a heap of junk that could only play non digital sources.,1,0,288
A2ZZU2O2ZNQUX3,0,This device does exactly what it is advertised as doing. The battery lasts for weeks. the storage is more than enough for a batterys worth of reading material. Be sure to keep it clean. or the interface will stop functioning.,4,1,225
A3013593EXPL9L,11,It works well and feels like a solid design and its very thin and light. I definitely like not having to replace batteries all the time. But the light is a cold blue tint. which keeps you awake at night .yes. this is backed by lots of research.. A warm tone with little or no blue frequencies would be much better. Its also a little too bright for me. and not diffuse enough .i.e. causes glare when used with something like a Nook or Kindle..,4,1,442
A301A2V0L1LCX8,0,Awesome. what you see is what you get. Came in the factory packaging and unrolls very nicely into the shape that you need it to be in.,5,0,134

A302UWNIQ1WUAT,0,PROS.The form factor of the device is good.  It is small. easy to exercise with.CONS.+ NT drivers are horrible.  They dont support NT. You have to find shareware to download MP3s to it.+ On  Win98 machine. the outofthebox software that Rio came with would not  recognize my second memory card.+ The base 32MB of memory was  corrupted on mine.  Some songs skip around or get mixed up as a result. +  Rio customer service is subpar.  I waited about an hour to talk to  someone.All in all. a very bad customer experience.  I will  probably buy a different MP3 player to replace this.,2,0,580
A3037LENN60BRZ,2832,These speakers are wonderful.  They are the best sound that I think you can get for speakers this size.  If you have a small space to put in nice speakers I would reccommend you get this.  I have had no problems with them  so far.  They are not hard to  install.  I would reccomend you get this  soon!,5,1,301
A303V1K9YEK4NR,25,I have researched and read many reviews on the nook. took in the good and bad and decided to get it. I havent found any problems with the sensitivity of the touch screen. the page turner was fast. I havent found any problems with it that I have read about so I find it definitely worth the money. Buy it! It saves timegas not having to drive to a bookstore. it saves room. so you wont have to carry a bundle of books as you travel. It is efficient and great.,4,1,458

A3054LDOT97N2G,2,Ive used several brands of VHS tapes but once Ive started using TDK DSP tapes. these tapes provide the best quality Ive found in this price range.  Made the mistake of buying the TDK Revue tapes recently. and the DSP tapes  are much better quality.,4,1,248
A305D1W0GUT2MO,55,now im not entirely disappointed but i got an 8GB Nook when i clearly ordered a 16GB. i dont know if there was an error but the box says 16GB and the Nook itself only has 8GB. other than this problem. which will be solved by a 32 micro SD card. the product was really nice and in good packaging. so ill leave it with a 3.5 star rating.,3,0,335
A305EHBJROWSHE,1,I use this radio mostly as a free standing weather radio for vacation and camping trips.  With all the included parts it also hooks up to an external power source. speaker and antenna for more power and range as a CB.  I have been pleasantly surprised at the quality and performance.  This CBweather radio is easy to use and easy to move from vehicle to vehicle.,4,1,362
A305R6KGM6GOXF,22,Good CB. fast delivery.and great price. The other reviews said the small attached rubber antennae did not have much range. they are correct. Fine though for cars traveling together. Attach an outside antennae and radio has good range.,4,1,234

A30AEGCLD6KB5G,0,Quite honestly. this is more hardware than any games can currently max out. It wont turn your 386 into a model 3 board. but it will run every 3D game out there at 1024x768 res well. Youll never have problems with older  games .which often only support Glide or basic D3D.. and it will always be  supported. For those of you who remember. 3DFX is to 3D cards what Creative  Labs was to sound cards. More u0026quotflashyu0026quot products may get churned  out. but they are soon forgotten.

A30E26GXRGRPWL,1897,Hi all. Id just like to say that I think for all you get in the box. and for short distances...in my opion its a great little radio.

I would have given it a higher star rating. but I havent been able to fine tweek it yet.  Thanks!,3,0,346

A30FO7X2OWME6O,0,I recently purchased a 6002PRO ssystem to install in a friends car. I used to install car electronics professionally so installation was clear and easy. The instructions manual plus a wiring diagram from the Bulldog website was very helpful. The system worked fine for 1 day and then sounded off at 5.00am for no reason and on a long drive the system sounded while driving. After that the system would no longer work so I sent it back for repair by Bulldog and they do not pay for shipping to them.They give you another remote worth USD20.00 for your trouble and time.  So I wonder if the Quality is poor on their systems or am I just the lucky one person out of a thousand. I hope your luck is better than mine.,3,0,712
A30G6FQ58DNY0W,55,When the FX came out it was called the pointing device of the year by either PC World or PC Week.  Within a year it was gone.  I was fortunate to be able to purchase three of the FXs and I keep one as a spare.  Some like it as a CAD drafting device. I for some reason didnt really like it that much as such.  Beyond that. it is the best trackball ever made and why Logitech discontinued it is beyond my thinking.  Its interesting to see the FX priced upwards of USD200 at Amazon or bidding on Ebay in the same area.  That should have told Logitech something. but I guess they dont read the  reviews.  Every now and then I bid on one on Ebay. but the bidding soon heads for the stratosphere.  I have never had any wrist problems with the FX. and perhaps that comes from having it too low and having to bend the wrist.  Beyond that. once again. the best ever trackball.  Maybe something Luigie Colani .sp. may have designed once upon a time.,5,1,939

A30HAGYXB3WZ1E,0,Its a good ereader.  How it compares to the kindle. I dunno I seen raves and complaints for both.For an ereader I love the nook. battery life is awesome.  would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators. the display looks great. even in direct sunlight more or less. The simple touch looks cool. very simplistic. no buttons all touchscreen for the most part. The extra USD40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook.covers anytype of damage from what I understand. Not as many CCNAcisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast. No addswhat I dont like only comes with 200mb of internal memory.  You have to pick up a microSD card Cant delete files or books. there is simply no option for it. Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see new screensavers for download better support for PDF files ability to read word doc solar power. geez why not it only makes sense.,4,1,985

A30JGLI2IBHC5X,33,Friends generously lent me their Canon 370Z to take on my vacation.  It was wonderful  very easy to learn and very easy to use.  The pictures have been processed and they came out very well.  I loved the flexibility  of photo sizes and the ease of using the telephoto feature.  I came home  and ordered one for myself. In fact. several of the friends with me on my  trip plan to do the same.  Seeing this camera in action definitely turns it  into a u0026quotgotta haveu0026quot.,4,1,479
A30K96YJ267NLI,1719,Being a heavy user of the PC around 8 hours a day I needed something flexible and the KB99NT is a great all round keyboard. quiet. comfortable and portable. Great for when you need some space on the desktop or just want to sit back. Unfortunately I run Windows 98 and cannot get the shortcuthot keys to work and would agree with the others about the mouse. its quite awkward but I have my Logitech trackball working at the same time as the keyboard pointer so I have the pointer when i need to be away from the desk and the trackball when i am nearer. Very good choice. well recommended for all.,4,1,595

A30MHGWF4LQXWX,3030,Installed in a snap. and reads pictures from every smart media card on the planet.  .I have 2.4.8 and 16 MB cards..  The installation was simple  .though I would have prefered instead of the preinstall of the software if  you could simple insert the disk when prompted for drivers..  The only  downside is that it tended to lock the machine when attempting to share one  of the drives it created.  All in all a great product and it does  everything it is advertised to do.,5,1,472
A30NAQHPPLFCW0,1515,i have owned 2 different e books and used 4. this is my favorite so far. the touch screen works better than i thought it would and seems scratch resistnant. i prefer it to the ones with buttons because you dont have to push to turn the page. it has a great battery life. i have used mine for 2 months and only charged it twice. and i read for hours on end. the screen has good resolution and is easy to read. even in the sun. my favorite part about this ebook is that it is compatible with multiple software programs. my literati would only accept books from the sponsor website. and i have a whole library already on my computer so this has been a plus.my only complaint is that it sometimes freezes up and needs to be reset. this has happened probably 6 times. it always seems fine after rebooting but it is still annoying. i think it may be because mine was used.,4,1,866
A30NQLJ0I6Y3AL,0,Battery looks original  BUT please beware  The LED charge indicator does not seem to work which made me suspicious if this was an original DELL. As of today. Nov 19th. the battery has stopped charging .Bought this in April  so 6 months old.. I am trying to contact them to returnreplace this  as there is no way an original Dell battery .as they have advertised. would have given up charging this soon.,1,0,402

A30PMBDGB7VPAO,0,I was seven years old when I first saw this film in a theatre in 1973.  I never forgot it.  Regardless of what the u0026quothighbrowu0026quot literarytypes say about the screenplay abandoning Twains original story. this is a terrific film for the young boy in your life whos beginning to notice the wonder of the world around him.As for the music. I dont think you could ask for more than the Oscarwinning duo who provided the tunes for most of Disneys movies for years. Richard and Robert Sherman.Then theres the films cast. most of whom have gone on to bigger and better things. Remember Sgt. Hulka from u0026quotStripesu0026quot? or Jeff East who plays Huck?  Not to mention little Jodie Foster.  Its worth buying the film just to see them when they were younger...Truly a great film with all the mischief and awe and fun that a young boy dreams of enjoying before hes forced to grow up!,4,1,890
A30QDNK2BSO7K5,1415,Would strongly suggest you buy one of these and use it before tossing out your old CD player.  Often a good CD lens cleaner like this one made by Maxell will do the job!,5,0,169
A30RADX680TQGQ,11,I hooked the speaker up as soon as I got it out of the box. Turned it on. thought wow thats rather impressive. Let me change it to one of the music channels. Then it stopped once I changed the channel. Called the customer service  on the transmitter. and sat on the phone for 15 to 20 minutes with an incompetent person who really didnt know anything about the product. On that note. I will be returning it to amazon.,1,0,417
A30RAXVWM8AEG,55,I hooked the unit up and connected it a TV but could not receive any stations. I noticed that the power LED on it was not lit. I swapped the unit out with another amp with a lower gain rating and was able to receive stations.,2,0,225
A30RJIZGP32I6R,0,I bought this radio to use on the walking portions of my daily commute from downtown Chicago to the suburbs .I take the train in between..  Unfortunately the reception is terrible in both places.  multiple stations  fading in and out with bursts of static common.  I had hoped that the  digital tuning would give improved reception over my old analog Sony. but  no!  I may have to fish the old Sony out of the trash  as bad as it can  be. its better than this one. alas.  Very disappointing!,1,0,491
A30SU644CDBJ2B,1819,Well the price was really good for the 4 pack of Maxell VHS tapes that I purchased but the quality of the recordings after 2 or 3 times was awful. Whatever I recorded the audio was fine but the picture just kept rolling. If you put the VCR on pause and then hit play it plays ok for a few seconds and then it starts rolling all over again. When I try to rewind the tapes 2 of the 4 tapes stop rewinding and shut the VCR off. When I turn the VCR back on. the tape pops out and I have to go over to the set and push the tape back in and hit rewind again. It takes about 3 or 4 times of doing this to get back to the beginning of the tape. VERY annoying. Its not the VCR as I have tried it in a couple of different machines with the same results. I guess the old saying is true that you get what you pay for. Ill go back to the high grade VHS tapes when I place another order and see if they are any better.,1,0,904

A30XWMW3RILVWC,11,Paml V is my first handheld device. Because of its beautiful design.the size and the weight mean a lot to me.. I bought it when it just came out. Regardless all the other Palm models are available on the market. I love my  Palm V. and highly recommend to others. Of course. you should get Palm Vx  for more memory power. I left my four address books. note and appointment  book in my closet. My Palm V goes where ever I go. It is also my alarm  clock now.,5,1,455
A30YOG7PY8MTTO,2630,The Palm V I bought came bundled with the Franklin Covey Planner software. which is pretty good stuff. However. a few things come out after you install everything and start to use it. I like the ability to enter data from my computer  I type better there. and being able to communicate with  the computer from the Palm speeds up collection of  business data. But they  dont tell you up front that none of your expense data will be collected if  you dont have Excell software in your machine.  Ive been using Lotus 123  and MS Works for years now. and cant get anyting from a Palm V into either  without creating a spredsheet and entering each and every number manually.  Another problem is that you must load BOTH the Franklin Planner AND the  Palm Planner software. and Synch twice to get everything from the Palm into  the computer. The Franklin accepts no expense data and the Palm software  takes no Time schedules. Finally when the Palm is cold  left in briefcase  in car trunk overnight  the tap with the stylus doesnt always work or is  off by a line or two. creating frustrating reentry situations.  It could  be an excellent aid to a small businessman like myself if it didnt take so  many iterations and buying additional software to be able to communicate  with my computer.,3,0,1285
A30ZYT7FTX0IM7,1341,There was once a time when all portable radios were made this size and shape. but few ever sounded so good. Yes its big and heavy. perhaps the SUV of portable radios  but. it has excellent sensitivity and selectivity. and the sound quality with a woofer and tweeter speaker setup is far better than any boom box of equivalent size. Battery life is literally astounding where a month of 24x7 continuous operation on alkaline D cell batteries is not unusual. For longer use. it even has AC power built in  no wall blister external power supply to lose.Because of the top sensitivity and selectivity. these super radios are also used by hobbiest long range AM radio reception enthusiasts. Superadio even has its own user group formed on Yahoo around its history and capabilities. The group offers tips to further improve reception and some design modifications. such as iPod hookups. Few products have this level of customer interest and you will find that the older models go for premium prices on auction pages. where even used current models command nearly a new price.Its large. heavy and a bit plain looking. It does not play CDs or tapes and does not have stereo sound. However. with the big speakers. it will put out a lot of volume so this is a good radio for camping. on the boat. constuction site or to save for emergencies. It even works well as a poor mans car radio.You may note that reviews seem to fall into to extremes. Likely this is a result of the current Chinese manufacture that has produced a few duds. If you get one. send it back for exchange. as the basic design of the radio is excellent. Lets face it. would this radio have more than a hundred reviews. unless it truly was an exceptional product!,5,1,1720
A310EQW2G09TAN,1719,I love my nook. would recommend it to anyone who wants a simple ereader. However the location of the charger is HORRIBLE!! I have had to replace my charger after having my nook for 2 years. The charger plugs into the bottom of the nook. making the cord get kinked very easily.,4,1,276
A311UKPJDYZOVL,0,Ive never felt a need for noise cancellation headphones. but I received these as a gift. Fortunately. no one spent a lot of money on them. because they really seem cheap to me. The construction is flimsy. and theyre bulky. Maxell might as well have included a paper sack to carry them in. as the bag that comes with them is not much more than that. It offers no protection to the headphones at all.I just cant see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce carryon space. I dont see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get. these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off. With noise cancellation on. the sound is even worse. Its flat and lifeless.I had recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser PX100s. They sound vastly better for the money. They fold down supercompactly into a nicelydesigned case and even cost a few bucks less.I dont know about the expensive noisecancellation headphones. but I would rather have a better pair of regular headphones for this price.,2,0,1000

A3140I2FX9ZFAZ,11,It has decent fidelity. and the sound volume is good.  The loudest setting does not distort.  It is easily heard over an electric toothbrush.  The volume knob is very easy to adjust with soapy fingers.  We use it mainly for NPRs morning news shows.  The autoshutoff is a must. also the channel PSETS.  We dont use the TV mode much. but have been glad it was there. especially during ballgames. The Weather button seems to be a good idea. although we dont use it.  We have so many other sources for weather info. that the button is redundant in our house.A few things would make it even better. but they are picky.  I would love a longer FM aerial .23 times.. or some easy way to plug in a longer aerial.  We live in the shadow of 2 really great FM stations which have more static than is tolerable.  Finally. it would be easier to see the contols if the top panel were at a 3040 degree slant toward the front.  The flat 90 degree panel makes for a bit of neck craning.  This will be less of a problem when I get familair to the touch of each control. and it is fixable with a different shower shelf .ours hangs from the nozzle pipe..All in all. it is everthing advertised and very well engineered.  I would buy one again.  But I will be thrilled if some cool. young engineer were to redesign it a bit as mentioned above.  Keep in mind. I am a picky person.,4,1,1356
A314CAGOWSJY6,22,These binoculars have good optical quality for a low price. The focus is a little tough to do because of the higher power. The focus lever is a little tight and its easy to go past the focal point because you have to press so hard on the focus lever. The higher power makes it difficult holding these binoculars steady but thats not a fault of the binoculars but just the fact that this is probably the highest optical power you can use and still be hand held. Field of view is also pretty narrow but once again this is because of the higher power. On the plus side these binoculars have a big bright image. The optics is quite sharp and the price is very reasonable. I like them and use them for bird watching but I do realize the compromises I have to make to get high power at a low price.,5,1,792
A314YGGISZRUUA,55,I had been thinking about an ereader off and on for a while. what really sealed the deal for me was buying Stephen Kings The Dome while on a trip for USD25 and having to lug that 1000 page behemoth around with me.  What sold me on the nook vs. the Kindle was really the fact that I could go to the store and try it out before hand. and the fact that it is more open.  Its primary use was going to be reading but I also wanted to be able to browse the web  just gmail and reading forums  and the ability to go to Bu0026N and try out my favorite sites and make sure they worked really sold me on it.  I also saw that the same Stephen King book was only USD9.99 on it...After having used it for a few weeks and having read 3 or 4 books on it. I like it even more than I had thought.  Its actually surprisingly good at web browsing .at least for the text heavy web pages I tend to visit. as long as you dont have to type anything more than a few sentences  and this wouldnt be a problem if it were easy to tell where your cursor was within the text if you want to go back and change something.  It does drain the battery relative to just reading. but relative to a laptop or cell phone .or even iPad.. it will last hours just web browsing  and no eye strain.  The interface for the web browser could use a little work in that sometimes when I want to hit the back button on the touchscreen. I actually hit the back to main menu button.  It would also be good if the browser remembered your preferred zoom level for web pages .at least for bookmarks..  The preview of all of the books is a really nice feature and being able to then buy the book immediately after reading the first 25 or so pages is both good and bad  good because you can preview a book before buying. and bad because you end up getting sucked in and want to read the rest.  Im a fast reader. so the Bu0026N store features are nice for me as I can get 14 or so through a book in the hour allocated.  The free weekly books are also nice as you get exposed to stuff that may be out of your usual reading and can be interesting.  The only problem I have is that sometimes it doesnt want to wake up from sleep and will then reboot. but its never lost my place in a book or suffered any ill effects.  I also like the selection of covers available right at Bu0026N.,4,1,2322

Ive edited text of a research paper on flights to and from Argentina. Ive copied down the names of interesting books in the library of a Bu0026ampB that I was staying at in Michigan. I checked email in a fleabag motel in West Virginia. The unit is a little pricey and isnt ethernetable .the reasons for the 4 stars rather than 5. but otherwise it proves to be a useful travel machine. .It fits nicely in my inside coat pocket as well..,3,0,607
A31CGOUCTFX7KB,914,The Olympus version of the NIMH batteries puts out 1300MA. The Radio Shack version lists 1200MA. I like the way the Olympus charger is designed.

A31CPG1NBV8HA1,1,I love these headphones! I bought these when a friend recommended them to me. I have gone through two sets of Clearline Concepts. which had a range of about 15 feet and broke easily. I then bought the Jensen headphones at  Target for USD60. and the foam material on the headphones disintegrated when  I opened the package! They were very cheaply made. This set came within 48  hours and my 12year old daughter set it up for me..Plus no nasty.  hardtoopen. plastic overwrap in the packaging.. Very easy to tune and  operate. Range is great. I can still hear my TV programs clearly when I go  downstairs or move from room to room. I just hope they have a longlife as  well.,5,1,671

A31DAQ55AUNMYW,3,I LOVE the performance of these very comfortable headphones.  They do an excellent job of eliminating aircraft noise while at the same time delivering excellent cd and dvd audio.  Whether you buy these or not  it must be said that noise cancellation headphones are worthless unless they cover your entire ear and this model is perfect sized.The one drawback I have is that the first pair I owned only lasted about 6 months .of admittingly heavy travel use. because the cord broke at the point where it connects to the midcord battery pack.  The connection integrity is pretty poor.I like these phones so much. and they deliver performance only slightly below my bosss BOSE phones that I have already bought a second pair and am hoping that being extra careful during use and when packing that I get much longer life out of them.,3,0,828

A31IS6M3XUUQVP,22,If youre wondering which product to buy. it really depends on your needs. The Rio has convenient controls. which unfortunately. the EigerMan does not. but then again the EigerMan has an incredible bass boost. which knocks  the socks off of Rios equalizer system .Rock. Pop. Jazz settings. etc..  This is not that important if youre jogging or playing sports outdoors  where there is too much outside noise to be able to hear the difference.  The EigerMan does not feature a belt clip as the Rio does. but this is not  important unless youre wearing those wierd pants with no pockets. The  EigerMan makes the most of the slow paralell port connection. it downloads  information from your PC a bit faster than Rio. The earphones supplied with  the EigerMan certainly outweigh those of the Rio. and all the better it  makes the experience more enjoyable. The real kick. though. is that the  EigerMan not only serves as a great Mp3 player. but also as a really nifty  portable drive. letting you download onto and upload off of your Mp3 player  several kinds of files. like other types of audio. documents. and even  images. Another advantage is that the EigerMan uses standard SmartMedia  Flash Cards to upgrade the memory. which can be traded between players.  which cannot be done with Rios own flash system. .If you think 2 hours of  music. 64 mb. is not enough. hold tight. In a few years. theyll be making  2GB flash cards. which provide over 12 hours of near cd quality sound.. One  thing I have to mention is the solidstate skip free design. which is a  major advantage over CDs and even MiniDiscs. The EigerMan has wonderful  battery life just one AA battery lasts over 12 hours. Though the EigerMan  software is a pain to get working. and it definitely didnt spend as much  time on the drawing board as Rio. the EigerMan definitely pulls out on top.,4,1,1855
A31IWYFTGF49BQ,1101,First of all. beware of many of the reviews in this section. as they pertain to the StreetPilot or Color StreetPilot. and NOT the StreetPilot III.  Unlike its earlier predecessors. the StreetPilot III does all of your routing for you. guiding you to your destination by telling you when and where to turn .with a voice as well as an onscreen display..  The earlier models .StreetPilot and ColorStreet Pilot. required you to preplan your route.  With the StreetPilot III. you can just enter the address youre heading to at any point in time. and it will automatically guide you there.Now that we have that out of the way... Once you own a SPIII. youll wonder how you ever lived without it.  Lets say youre driving around town and you get hungry.  Ask it for the nearest restaurants. and it will list them all .showing you which is closest to where you are at that particular moment..  Pick one from the list. and it will guide you there with spoken directions as you drive.Or lets say your friend calls you on your cell phone and tells you to meet him at a particular address.  Enter it into the unit .this takes a little work. as theres no keyboard. but no more than 30 seconds max.. and it will direct you to the address on the quickest route possible from whereever you happen to be at that particular moment.  Hit some traffic along the way?  Tell the SPIII. and it will pick an alternate route.Worried about the unit becoming obsolete?  Dont be.  You can upgrade the software .not the maps. but he actual software the unit runs. over the internet for free!Overall. an amazing unit...,5,1,1587

A31OTXODQHGC1O,67,I purchased this in February after discovering that DISH Network was billing me five extra bucks a month because I didnt have a phone line connected to my DVR. The RC930 was a little less expensive back when I bought it than it is today. but it was well worth the cost.

A31OY8RCMP5IUR,22,I bought the above product locally.  Setup was easy except if you do not have windows.  They supplied a setup disk that was faulty.  I tried numerous times to get a replacement disk from their office in Texas.  You  cannot speak directly to a rep. you must leave a message and they will get  back to you at their own leisure.  I waited over two months for the disk.  IT NEVER CAME.  This was after I was told it was on its way three times.  I  never recieved the rebate either.

A31PGMNHHNTAJC,1314,I asked for B u0026 N gift cards for christmas to purchase this. Boy was that a mistake since now Im stuck with it or USD250 in Bu0026N credit  neither of which I want. Wish I had realized you could only purchase Bu0026N overpriced books and apps .which are free elsewhere and very limited.. This was a question we even asked at the store and the guy said all the book prices are set and the same everywhere. This is completely untrue. I tried to check out ebooks from the local library and was unable to do that either. There was this whole big process with downloading some adobe and having to put the book on a computer and then on the nook. I gave up after about 20 min of trying. Wish I wouldve bought the kindle fire or an ipad and simplified my life. And what happens if Bu0026N goes out of business like Borders? Then the device is useless since its only meant for Bu0026N products. Also look here for accurate reviews if youre interested in purchasing the nook tablet. Bu0026N is screening the reviews and wouldnt post mine.,2,0,1033

A31U0ZQTNIQTHY,1219,As a faithful owner of the nook color. I went to my Bu0026N just to try it out.. and was absolutely wowd!!!  I purchased it immediately and sold my Nook Color.  This Nook Tablet is much improved and well worth every penny! Its been 3 weeks and I am still amazed at the superfast responsiveness. the crisp and vivid screen. the overall build quality. and the small drop in weight does make a noticeable difference to me.  The interface received some touchups that makes usability much more pleasant and more organized.  This tablet is powerful and packs a mean punch. I dont go anywhere without it!  I came across the Fire yesterday and immediately lost interest after taking a glance at the cloudyblurred looking screen and swiped my finger across it which in turn revealed a sluggish interface.. this 10 second interaction simply solidified that I made the right decision to upgrade to the Nook Tablet .. Hope this helps!,5,1,922
A31UHOIFMFSCN1,1617,It is absolutely useless.  The pictures are grainy. blurry. and have color aberrations galore.  You cant even see facial features on people.  It is not a true 640x480 camera it uses software to obtain the 640x480 advertised resolution.  Downloads are horribly slow. and the memory is not removeable. so you cant use a better download method.  It will drain the batteries with only one loading and unloading of the 2MB memory.  This thing is not even useful as a toy for your children.  Fortunately I bought from a reputable online dealer who took the thing back. and even refunded all shipping charges.  Do yourself a favor and get an Olympus D360L or D460Z.  ...a lot more money. but about the least you can pay for a digital camera that takes decent pictures.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!,1,0,784

A31X26ICX1KTTO,22,I have had seven different computer speaker systems. including numerous four and five piece systems. and I will honestly say. Ive never heard a better set of speakers than the Altec Lansing ACS48.  They are incredibly  clear and vibrant. the all wood subwoofer cabinet ensures that bass is  clear and responsive. the main speakers are equipped with midrange speakers  and tweeters. and treble is outstanding. Pros. Excellent sound quality. low  cost. easy to set up Cons. large bass module. no treble adjustment. bass  adjustment knob not easily accessible .on the module itself.,5,1,579

A3202C86H3AD1V,0,Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Wont connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it wont work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. Im calling the Bu0026N tech people. If they cant fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didnt sign up for hours of struggling with Nooks technical problems. I have better things to do.Update. Customer service didnt help. Took it to Barnes u0026 Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldnt look at it. I figured if the battery cant hold a charge for that long than I didnt want the device. The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping. This thing cost me time and money. a bad experience all  around. Ill never buy a B u0026 N product again. certainly not from a third party seller.  Ive ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony. Hopefully Ill have better luck,1,0,944
A320EVMBXQI9B8,12,I have a 40 inch Sony tv and I was very disappointed that even this common tv couldnt fit the right bracket measurements. I had to create my own mounting method with the brackets and the screws in the back of my tv.Thats not even the worse part. The actual mount itself cant even hold my 49 lbs tv. My tv is at a constant downwardfacing angle. The metal arm itself is bending down because it simply cannot hold my tv how its supposed. Im scared to even use the full motion capability of the mount because the further I extend it. the more my tv hangs.I leave 2 stars for simple directions. and it came with all the screws and equipment I needed. .Besides a power drill.Not completely happy with this product.,2,0,708
A321RGIBIH9B4M,0,Im sure this is a fine product. but I could not get mp3 files to load onto it. and stay loaded on it. for either my Samsung S4 or my Nook.  The common denominator has to be the Android OS. It supposedly doesnt play nice with SD cards on purpose. because Google doesnt want customers blaming Android for slow performance when crappy SD cards are to blame. Until and unless phones and tablets start providing generous internal memory on the cheap. this tactic punishes those who dont have deep pockets.,3,0,500
A322FVZWHUHNXO,33,As mentioned in previous reviews the system does crash in a consistent manner.  Mine took a year to fail. but it freezes after several minutes of play and the chapter selection fails completely. Also. Thompson Electronics. the service support for RCA. is expensive and provides very  poor service.  Their solution to fixing my problem is to send a refurished  system without even looking at my system.  They cannot send a new system.  since RCA stopped producing this product. I think that should indicate  something.,1,0,517

A3256Z643XWV6Q,35,I bought this light on Amazon thinking it is a great concept .and I like Moleskin products.. but when I received it. plugged it into my computer and clicked it on....it didnt click off.  I tried a few times and the clicker just doesnt work!  The only way to turn it off is to actually let it run out of charge.  It seems like other folks have this same issue. so Im going to return it without getting an exchange as it seems that my problem is more of a rule than an exception.  Very upset as I thought the concept was great.,1,0,525
A325C5H2ABIC4Z,22,I am giving this great device 5 stars. because it really works great. got my life organized. and is allaround amazing.  It has plenty of memory for my needs. and the battery lasts forever!  It really beats carrying around a 2lb organizer .which I never did. so I MISSED appointments. concerts. birthday parties. etc...  HOWEVER...I really hate how the power button gets pushed when I dont want it to.  When I put it in my purse. I can hear the little button going u0026quotbeep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.u0026quot  I dont think I should have to resort to sticking little adhesive bits of rubber on my Palm or cutting a hole in my case to prevent this.  For this reason alone I am considering u0026quotdowngradingu0026quot to the new Palm m100 which seems to have solved this problem.  Otherwise. I love my Palm V!!!!!,5,1,826

I brought it to one place recommended by Pioneer and had to wait about two months to get it back.

A327GK6XKAKQZG,0,If theres one thing I dislike about Ethernet cords its the price that some companies try to charge for them. I have. unfortunately. shelled out USD20 for a 20 foot Ethernet in the past thinking it was the price I had to pay. Either this price is outrageous or the sellers online are crazy.After buying a switch for my college dorm room I needed an extra Ethernet cord. Since the switch box was about a foot from the Ethernet plug I needed a small length. and 3 feet seemed adequate.This light blue cord is exactly what I needed and is listed at an exceptional USD2.75. With Amazon Prime this is like spending the quarters you find in your couch cushions.I always recommend buying Ethernet cords .or 90% of products. online. The deals are too good to pass up!,5,1,758
A329C02K166231,34,I purchased this item to use at night so I dont disturb my wife...It is a great product and has worked great. .although I had to replace the rechargable batteries as they were dead. and wouldnt hold any charge..  The reception is good up to 100 feet with line of sight. but only about half of that through a wall.  The earpieces are comfortable and provide good sound quality.  My only complaint is that after using the set for any length of time the ear pada can become uncomfortable as they are very tight against the ears.,4,1,525

A32C2CB1N0KPRF,0,I bought this camera so I could email photos to my family and use them for web pages. I would not print out pictures for framing but do use it to print out small images for greeting cards. My expectations of this camera  were limited to the money I spent. The supplied software for this camera  makes it easy to get images into my computer and highly recommend using  this for the first time user or someone that doesnt need a lot of  features.,4,1,444
A32CL0MVLXEJLJ,810,I recently purchased a Uniden BC 245XLT handheld scanner and am generally very pleased with it. It is well designed. well made. easy to program manually. and has good sound quality. My only complaint so far is my  inablity to use its new. highly touted u0026quotSmartscanneru0026quot feature to  download frequencies from the UnidenBearcat national frequency database  via a PC or external modem. To access the database via a PC. it is  necessary to go to Unidens Website. download a small program .that is  zipped but not selfunzipping.. install the program and. while its  running. dial a 900 phone number thats preprogrammed into the scanner.  Unfortunately. it took me many frustrating and unsuccessful attempts to  connect with the 900number database using both my PC and. separately. an  external modem before I discovered that my phone company. GTE  Communications Corporation. routinely and automatically blocks 900 numbers  from being dialed and that there is no way of getting around the block.  While the scanners operating guide mentions the possibility of a 900 block  on ones phone line. since I had never requested such a block from the  phone company. it had never occurred to me that there would be one as a  matter of GTE policy. Thus. before buying a BC 245XLT with the hope of  using the Smartscanner feature. a person should check with hisher phone  company to make sure that 900number calls can be made. If 900number  blocking is fairly common among phone companies. I think Uniden should  switch to a non900 number for frequency downloading. Or. if they maintain  their policy of charging for downloads. they should consider making them  available over the Internet through the use of a credit card and a secure  server.Wouldbe purchasers of the BC 245XLT should also be aware that  Unidens 800 Customer Service number. once one is able to get through. may  be answered by someone who doesnt know much about the Smartscanner feature  of the product. The first time I called and told the Customer Service  representative that I was getting an u0026quoterroru0026quot message on the  scanner screen when I tried to dial the 900number frequency database. I  was told that that was because their server would not be operational for  another couple of days. When I tried a couple of days later and still got  an error message. another customer rep demanded to know. u0026quotWho told you  that about our server?u0026quot but did give me some useful information about  COM port settings in the software I had downloaded previously from the  Uniden Website. On my next attempt and next error message on the scanner. a  third and different customer rep told me that. after seeing the 1 900  prefix on my scanner screen. I would need to manually punch in the rest of  the telephone number on the scanner keypad to be able to make the call. It  was only when that didnt work that I called my phone company and  discovered that there was a 900 block on my phone line. As a last resort. I  called Uniden again and asked if there was any way. other than using the  900 number. to download frequencies. She told me she would have to ask her  supervisor and. a couple of minutes later. gave me another 800 number to  call. When I called that number. which I think was the Bearcat Radio Club.  and told the person who answered about my Smartscanner problem. she  replied. u0026quotI dont know nothing .sic. about that.u0026quot As is often  necessary these days. I then asked. u0026quotIs there someone there who  does?u0026quot A fairly knowledgeablesounding person then came on the line  and suggested that some purchasable third party software might do the  trick. I havent tried this yet but. in these matters. hope springs  eternal. I guess.,4,1,3753

A32EFC3RIULYYN,2,The Diamond Rio is fantastic in that it is easy to use. extremely small. and has tons of memory.  The player itself is as great as all the reviews have said.  The buttons on the player are simple...the player isnt jammed with a ton of buttons and options you dont need.  When you press anything. an indiglo light illuminates the display so you can see.  There is also a power bar on the display which lets you know how much battery power you have left.The Koss headphones it comes with though are not very good...not the most comfortable things to loop around your ears.The player is great but the software is not the best...it took me some time to figure out that you had to .within the Rio program. manually choose the device and set the software to work with the Rio Diamond 500 before you could send music from the USB port to the player.  But now that I have figured out how to work the software correctly. I love the player.For the price. it is definitely worth it compared to the competition.,4,1,999

A32I07L6RTFMUA,0,Im not a fussy headphone buyer. I like em simple and cheap. so long as they get the job done.Sound Quality. Well. they sound good to me. Ive had some headphones sound tinny or  weird . but these sound pretty normal. Mind you. Im certainly no audiophile and I abhor  bass  in my music and whatnot. so take that into consideration. For basic computer usage and pop music. these sound perfectly fine.Comfort. Actually. these are the most comfortable headphones Ive ever worn. I get headaches if I wear a pair of headphones for too long. due to the pressure on my head. I also cant wear headbands for the same reason. These headphones are so lightweight and flexible that I can barely tell Im wearing them  and so far. no headaches. even though Ive worn them for some longer periods than I normally wear headphones.Overall. Id say Im surprisingly impressed with these headphones. I got them expecting the usual cheap headphones I buy .the brand changes. since I just buy the cheapest phones I can find by a brand Ive actually heard of. and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones. I havent had them for long. so I cant speak to the endurance of them. but even if they only last a short bit. I think Id actually just replace them with these same ones. Theyre really that comfortable.,5,1,1310
A32I8DVPCJ4Q3P,23,Ive had this one for about a month and a half. and it quit working. Also. it would only work if pointed exactly at the base of the t.v. A little bit one side or the other and up or down and it would not work. I learned my lesson. you get what you pay for.,1,0,255

A32ITVYCZ662SW,0,Based on another reviewers recommendation. I at first got the Bushnell Powerview 4x30 instead of these XtraWide 4x21s.  But I just wasnt satisfied with the fieldofview of the 4x30s .not only do the specs overestimate their ability. but they only apply to the width of view. not the height..  With the 4x21s. the field of view actually seemed to be larger than the specs indicate. and provided a nice round image. as tall as it was wide.  It was like the difference between night and day!  Also. I didnt experience any eye fatigue as the other reviewer mentioned. this may be because I was watching football instead of basketball .less constant action and movement..  But to be honest. if I get eye fatigue from these 4x21s. I would still rather use them than the 4x30sI can take a break or let a friend use them if my eyes start getting tired .besides. I never like holding binoculars up to my head the whole game anyway..,4,1,922

A32N9OCOA0J7K9,19,I bought this camera knowing that it was a low end model so I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the pictures are.

It took me two days to figure out that the serial cable was just not completely plugged into the hole in the camera. I almost threw it out the window before I pushed the connecter hard and heard it finally snap into place. Im dissappointed that there are no NT drivers so I can hook it up to my laptop.

The Only thing I can think is  that those who have a problem with it are trying to use their index finger.  In that case. the side of your hand does get in the way.  Try it!  Point  your finger and see how this can be a problem.  Me however. I use my thumb  and the problem is no longer.  Pretend you have your four fingers on top of  the unit and look at your thumb.

Im in the process of installing an external antenna hope fully that will restore my faith in this radio. Also its not water proof.,1,0,481
A32YR837ETUSXC,0,I have owned my Sony DVPS7700 player for some time and I never had any problem with it.  Therefore. I was amazed that some people actually had a problem with this player as posted in some of the other reviews.  I. for one. found the sound quality to be excellent.  Incidentally. of all the professional reviews I read on the S7700. never once did I see a review mention that the sound quality of this unit was only fair.  Articles I have read have also compared this player to a topoftheline cd player.  And I agree with them.  After installing my player. I can honestly say my cds sounded better.  This has me convinced that not all cd players sound the same.  My only thought for people who are having sound problems is perhaps they should have a home theater technician look into their setup.  Maybe all that is needed is a small adjustment and then they will know what the rest of us are talking about when we marvel about how great a DVD player this is.  In case you are wondering. I do not work for Sony I am just a very. very satisfied Sony customer.,5,1,1057
A32Z1V9II49XZY,44,Im shopping around for wireless speakers to use in a conference room at work so that I can pull in a few folks attending by teleconference.Im sorry. but I just dont think theres any way I could set this up on my conference table without some of my colleagues having to work very hard to conceal a grin. or even a snicker.The problem. to put it delicately. is that the antenna is. well. er. its um. kinda... WELL. JUST LOOK AT IT!  A possible distraction.,3,0,454
A32ZH4JH8KP5D7,0,Bought this unit to use with a Sansa E280. Really great price of USD10.49 but the sound quality really lacks. Guess I shouldnt beef too much considering the price. It is useable. but as another reviewer said. it sounds muffled. I have an infinity deck with 10 speaker infinity sound system. so I really dont think its my system. I guess my next move is an FM unit. Hope it sounds better.,3,0,387
A32ZO9M5YM5UOD,34,Took 30 minutes to install and works great.  You cannot beat the price anywhere!  Arrived very quickly and has plenty of options to fit different TVs or hang on any type of wall .drywall. concrete. etc..,4,1,203
A330PQAR1XWTXB,0,I got this really fast and packaged very securely. It worked wight away and perfect. And this is actually the Nook brand. So it was nice to keep it all the same. I would definitely order from them again.,5,1,203
A33261SH14NDM3,12,This item works as advertised. but does not provide highquality or clear audio.I tested it at an electrical outlet not surrounded by electronic equipment.  It put out a lot of static.  I installed it at an electrical outlet next to a power strip operating electronic equipment and got the same high level of static.Pros.  It installs easily and provides an extra phone jack at the location where it plugs into an existing phone jack.  This let me continue to use my landline phone.  I did not expect this extra phone jack.Con.  The audio quality of the telephone line that plugs into the remote receiver is poor.I will keep the unit because it provides an adequate signal for interaction between my receiver and my satellite provider.  Otherwise I would return it.,3,0,764

A335H4EFPYLTQK,0,I receantly purchased 2 quick Cams from Logitech because of the brand name and affortable price. I sent one Cam to New York for the Video Conferance feature I installed the softwear acording to the directions and the Cam  wouldnt work so I went onto the Logitech web sight for tech support. the  information there was very confusing and hard to follow  but I tried it  anyway.  After failing again I then had to call a long distance phone  number  not a 800 number like most tech support . and the person helping me  wasnt interested in helping me . wanted to regester me for the mailing  list. He then told me to reinstall the software and call him back if any  problems. Well again I had to call but this time I got someone else. after  tring to get help for him the time was 5PM and the line just went dead.  I  then tried to call back but got a recording saying the office is closed   I will be returning both Cams now and make sure I or any of my friends buys  anything from Logitech agan.,1,0,994
A336QPTTKQD8RT,49,I wife was wanting eBook reader and out of all the different tablets she decided on the Nook! Which in its self if a great piece of hardware very durable! However Im just waiting for her to get tired of the propriety Nook UI. it took my about 30 seconds to discover the CRAP Bu0026N setup up on this device!!! So when she get fed up with it. I will root it and install a full copy of Android OS on it. May even go for broke and drop Kit Kat on it!!!Barns and Noble  I love your stores. but you are as bad as Apple with propriety BS!!!!,3,0,535
A33716SZH8XGA1,22,Light. comfortable and no complaints from listeners.  Use it on remote and cell phones. works fine.  Reasonable price.  Previous one .same model. lasted seven or eight years before the jack or cable wore out. so I got my moneys worth.,4,1,234
A33847W2G9IKVF,0,unless my port configurations are strange. which im sure they arent. this cable is only capable of 4bit transfers.. that is. around 70ksec at most.  junk compared to universal FAST cables or even 8bit.  you get what you pay for. i guess.,2,0,237
A338S86VZNWU87,35,I have tried to set up this hub with my home cpu and laptop and with no luck so far. I am using windows xp on both cpus and I am getting frustrated with the whole thing. I am getting sorry I bought this hub. it shouldnt be this much trouble to set up a connection between my computers. I may take it back to the store where I bought it and find something a little easier to set up. If I do not succeed in getting help from the people who manufactured it. it is history.,1,0,469
A339H1U3QHTOPN,8,The product worked as expected. order it on Feb 24th 2011 and did not receive it until March 28th 2011 a whole month and when I asked for them to reship express they would not accommodate. Probably wont buy from this seller again...,4,1,232
A339X7YGDO8VZ0,0,We ordered this for our 10 year old daughters birthday.  It is an excellent device. easy to use. beautiful screen resolution and plenty of storage.  It has many of the features of a much more expensive tablet.  It doesnt have a camera. which we were happy about for the safety of our daughter.,5,1,293
A339XRNDH5D2T9,12,I dont think that this camra is very good. I took pictures and the dpi is really bad its too big and the pictures look really bad also. I was amazed how fast the Batteries ran out. I suggest you dont buy this.,1,0,209
A33A5UMF23JS0U,2424,I have had my Nook for several months now and I love it!  I had been thinking about purchasing an ereader for a while. but I have never liked reading for long periods of time on a computer screennever realizing that devices like the Nook .and the Kindle. use a different type of screen that is totally different then a back lit computer screen.Being able to go into a B u0026 N store and actually handle the Nook was what finally sold metoo bad I didnt wait until the price dropped!!  Plus. the store personnel were very helpful and they even have a class on Wednesday nights for new Nook owners or those curious about it.One thing that pushed me to the Nook over the Kindle is the ability to read library books digitally checked out from my local public library.  This does require downloading a .free. piece of software called Adobe Digital Editions onto your computer. but there was a very clear set of instructions on the Bu0026N message boards relating to the Nooka good place to check out if you are considering buying one.One comment I will make is that if you like to read books with pictures or diagrams in them the Nook .and probably the Kindle too. is not the best thing for you.  The Nook will display pictures. but not in the clearest or easiest way.  Its best for reading straight text like novels.I quickly determined that a cover was a good idea and ordered oneat that time my local store did not have any in stock .now they do..  Its probably a good idea for most people. but there are a variety of covers and cases available .in store. online and from other places such as Best Buyso shop around and look at some..If you like a certain author. genre. etc. I highly suggest exploring whats available as that could very well influence your decision.  I am a very eclectic reader and have been happy with whats available so far.  Bu0026N does tout the fact that free books from Google book are available for the Nook.  I have downloaded a few of those.  Most of these are older and the scanning quality is not always the best. I do like historical books. so this is of some interest to me. but it might not be for you.I do travel from time to time and had no trouble at all going through security at the airport with my Nook and its great for traveling to have a variety of books i one handy gadget.The Nook also allows you to read a book for free for up to an hour if you are in a Bu0026N store and I have done that several times and I do like that feature.  You can also download a free sample of most books. but its often only a few pages.I highly recommend the Nook. I am happy with mine. but do suggest you check out the message boards on bu0026Ns website and see if a store in your area offers a class where you can check out the nook in detail.,5,1,2766
A33A6WC8YMDC50,22,I received my new DC70 Case Logic Digital Camera Bag. along with my Nikon 3500 camera and was disappointed not have the padded divider along with the bag.  I dont want to return the entire bag but have been frustated at finding a way to communicate with Amazon.com to find out it they can replace the divider.,3,0,309
A33B0A0WTULCN8,56,I really wanted to like this mount. but Im somewhat disappointed.  I have installed many different types of mounts. so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent. but there are some items of which you should be aware.* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV .as I did for a 37  LG.. then be aware that the extension arms are  maxed out  at this size. which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV. the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isnt completely the VideoSecus problem. but since there is no flexibility at this size. I had to rig it together offcentered only using two screws on the bottom arms.* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function. and this is by far the biggest pain Ive ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws. you have to use a wrench .cheap one included. to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.* Similar to the above. the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench. but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level .keeps slipping. even with a helper.* Lastly. be aware that when folded completely. the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 23  to the left or right. depending on which way you fold the arms.  If youre looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall. keep this in mind.,3,0,1535
A33B0LGJ5HJ94G,22,I live in Mexico City and purchased a NOOK for my wifes birthday. It is useless. worthless and a waste of money to me. as upon attempting to sync and download books. I was informed that I am unable to outside of the U.S. Does Barnes u0026 Noble  realize are living in a Global Community.I plan on giving my NOOK away to a family member in the U.S. and getting a KINDLE.as it does work outside of the U.S.!!,1,0,406
A33CG1L42QFP31,1119,I am writing this for those of you thinking of buying it for the new Kindle Three. The other reviewers have pretty much said everything else about it. Beautiful craftsmanship and a worthy compliment to the Kindle. Here is the good news. The new Kindle fits perfectly and securely in this cover. It is also light enough to hold for extended periods of time in one hand and the note part folds back quite nicely. All in all I am very happy with this cover.,5,1,454
A33FFM2YST8X93,44,I use this to stream netflix when I want to have full bandwidth on my wired connection.  Sometimes it loses connection and stutters but most of the time it works.  Good item if you have unlimited data for netflix or youtube etc.,3,0,228
A33G5TE7NNWTKC,0,I was pleasantly surprised by the case. considering the low sale price.  I was looking for a case to use as a wallet replacement. so I was very concerned about slimness. Although the dimensions .my estimates with an ol  fashioned ruler.. 5.5 X 3.75 X 1 .a weebit thicker if stuffed with cards  and cash. seemed large on paper. it fit quite nicely in the front trouser  pocket .too bulky for shirt pocket. BTW..  This is because. compared to a  comparable u0026quotslim leather bifold caseu0026quot I used before. the Incase  has smooth. rounded edges. which makes it u0026quotfeelu0026quot slimmer in the  pocket.  Its also very light plus it doesnt have an exterior tab like  most wallettype cases. to snag on your pantpockets when  retrievingreplacing your case.  Since its an enclosed case. the alarm  was only slightly muted. so I would set the alarms on the high setting. On  the aesthetics side. it DOES feel and look slick. I like the color. deep  navy u0026quotmidnightu0026quot blue.  It looks more rectangular. and less  ovalshaped than the pix suggest.  It also has reinforced edges on the  inside. which protects it. and also provides a good grip while using the  visor. Not to make this a dissertation. but the design also gives you  easier access to cards and cash compared to the bifold design .IMHO..  The  styus holder is a nice touch. saving me the trouble of pulling it out of  the visor each time. Overall. a very good value.  The only minus is the  use of velcro to secure the handheld in the case. but who cares!  Dont  tell anyone... . So. if youre an obsessivecompulsive like me .if you  own a palmdevice. you probably are.. and want all your things in one  place. then this is a nice alternative to the traditional leather wallet  cases.,4,1,1762
A33GDKNB6ENQDN,1718,I preordered this case about 20 minutes after it became available on Amazon. I was excited I finally found a stylish case that looks somewhat professional that also has an integrated .albeit oldfashioned. paper notebook. .I also have a Dodocase and a Treegloo case. but of course. neither of them have notebooks attached.. So I had high hopes for this  and when I received it on Wednesday. I wasnt disappointed.The Good. The quality of the case is exceptional. The leather exterior and the suede interior are very nice. The iPad slides in and out of the case easily. and is still sturdy enough to ensure that it wont move. The flap that secures the iPad in the holster seems to very well made. and is designed so it is one piece with the rest of the holder .as opposed to it being sewn on after the fact.. There are slots on notebook side of the case that allows it to be positioned in either the top or the bottom of the flap  this allows you to rotate the notebook around if youre left handed. The case is a little padded. so it seems like I would do a decent job of protecting the iPad in the event of a drop. All of the controls for the iPad are easily accessible The notebook is a great size  not too big. not too small.The not so good. The case is somewhat thicker than I would have expected. Not terribly so. but just having the notebook beefs it up a tad. Id say its about a bit more than inch or so. The binding is more rounded than it is square. This may be a personal preference. but I would like a more squared binding. If youre left handed .Im not. they instruct you to flip the case over so the notepad is on the other side. Unfortunately for lefties. this makes the iPads home button on the top of the case.which may be weird. The interior lining is a very light tan. so it may get dirty relatively easily. The binding doesnt really seemed to be rigid at first. so it takes some finagling to get it closed so the top and bottom of the cover match up. I have a feeling this may improve as the casegets used more and the binding stars to develop some memory. I have no idea how much a replacement notebook will cost for this thing. but like all Moleskine products. I imagine it will be relatively expensive. I suppose that should be expected. though.All in all. Im very happy with the case. The fit. finish and overall feeling that it gives makes it a great option for those that are considering it for professional purposes. or casual use. But if youre left handed. you have to ask yourself if it is too weird having the home button on the top. and if the cost of the replacement notebooks make it worthwhile .rather than just using a Dodocase and a regular Moleskine notebook. for instance..But for me  its a no brainer. This is my new MondayFriday case.,5,1,2769
A33GO0KKMW20BK,1718,I have this unit with the 32 Meg Flash Card. When I first bought the product. I was running around like a happy fool glad to be ride of my walkman bouncing around my waste on short jogs. After the honeymoon was  over I started to have issues. The software that came with it. was the  music match software.It was good for only a limited number of plays before  expiry.I called diamond and they told me their RIO Port software was to  come out shortly. When the software did come out I found it didnt work  properly on the PMP300. I looked for some help files on u0026quotconfiguration   troubleshooting u0026quot but there was none. Tech support told me this was  a known issue the pmp300 doesnt always show up as a configurable option so  reinstall the software. 3 reinstalls later I still couldnt get the Rio  port software to work. so I gave up and I just reinstall the music match  software when it expires every two weeks. Since then my LCD has become dim  and the plastic belt handle broke. The unit is about a year old now and  cost about 230 USD new.I really like my MP3 player but I will not buy  another RIO .I am looking at alternatives,3,0,1146
A33H0WC9MI8OVW,33,I still prefer my Rio 500 and have yet to u0026quotupgradeu0026quot to any of the newer MP3 players.  It is light. smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use.  I used it primarily to listen to Audible .audio books. while commuting and it has been flawless .with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly. with a checkerboard screen..  A quick search at Rios website .rioworld.org. revealed a recovery utility. which I ran and recovered my Rios firmware.  Whew!,4,1,479
A33H10BO12I91N,0,ive had this player for about 1 day. ive gone through all the reviews on this site and sifted through the pros and cons. most of the cons expressed by others did not apply to me. the software loaded without a hitch. i  downloaded songs with no problem. i was up and running in under the 20  minutes it took a previous reviewer.  i will agree that the cases webbing  impedes the access to the volume. and i wish when i was in browse mode that  the complete title would scroll for better viewing .presently you only see  the artist.. i also wish i could upload songs. but these are just minor  quibles. this is an excellent product that feels sturdy and performs well.  one suggestion. ditch the earbuds for a better set of headphones and youll  enjoy the experience even more,4,1,774

Im somewhat disappointed in the speed with which files are accessed. but its nice to  have large 100Mb storage capacity on my diskettes.Now. however. I wish I  had invested more money and instead bought the Iomega JAZ drive. With 2  gigs on each disk. it gives you virtually unlimited space that you can  simply keep adding on to.If you dont have a lot of data to save. this  is fine. But for the price.

A33IRJTIYGJ0UZ,22,I recieved this camera for Christmas and was delighted. It is very easy to use and I didnt need to read through complicated instruction manuals.  However. it sure did use up a lot of batteries.  I even bought rechargeable batteries. which only lasted for about an hour.However. after using the camera for about a month the LCD viewer stopped working properly .lots of lines through it.and I returned it to WalMart for an exchange.After owning the camera for another 312 months. I noticed that the area around the most frequently used button .for displaying the pictures.CRACKED!  The button was no longer functional.  I again returned the camera to WalMart for an exchange.  Now. after reading the other reviews. I have decided to return it a third time for a store credit and get a different camera.I would NOT recommend buying this camera.,2,0,841
A33JB94FFYCU5G,34,How do you begin to quantify a null?Do I love it? No. Thatu00268217s 5 stars. Do I like it? Yes. Thatu00268217s 4 stars.To rate the quality of this null we must first define the null.There is a u00268220null hypothesisu00268221. There is u00268220nullificationu00268221. There is a u00268220nullification crisisu00268221.In short. the u00268220null hypothesisu00268221 refers to a general or default position. that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena. In the case of the Null Modem Adaptor it would appear that it invalidates its own existence. But. There it is.Letu00268217s skip to the u00268220nullification crisisu00268221. South Carolinas 1832 Ordinance of Nullification. A long boring story that totally misses the point.So. what about nullification? State nullification is the idea that the states can and must refuse to enforce unconstitutional federal laws. Now thatu00268217s interesting reading but I donu00268217t think it applies.The u00268220null modem adaptoru00268221 exists because no one can understand a word of this Wiki reference. ......It exists due to the inherent incompetence of humanity.The quality of this null modem adaptor is invaluable. It is in itself a shrine to the quality of life. Since no one ahead of me can understand where pins 2 and 3 go and tell me that the reason it donu00268217t work is my fault. this lowly little piece of hardware that tries by definition to invalidate itself allows me to confirm my existence and walk away. It is. The Null Modem Adaptor.Donu00268217t leave home without one.,4,1,1559
A33KDDUVDG4TDU,17,Didnt charge my Lenovo IdeaTab A2109 tablet.On the other hand. I did find one that did work very well.http.www.amazon.comPowerGenDualPortTravelChargerdpB0073FE1F0ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8u0026qid=1361480871u0026sr=81u0026keywords=ac+tablet+charger+2+A,1,0,244
A33M6I2BY6NXMX,0,I have been searching around for quite some time for a case for my Kindle that I would be satisfied with.At first I was attracted to the overall look of the Moleskin case. I liked the black external material and the interior color as well. I think that the color scheme of this case is very professional looking.I read different reviews about this case and a lot of comments were stating that there was a lot of issues with the placement of the journal. To many reviewers. this seemed as if it were designed for a left handed Kindle User. Which in many ways is why I decided to purchase this item. I am left handed and the journal placement works out great for me.Having the journal and the Kindle inside of the case does add more bulk to the overall size of the case. however. I do not see that as an issue and it still looks like a great case. I like writing notes down as I write. so I like the idea of having the journal inside of the case. even it if makes is a little bigger.I also like the fact that there is a band that will hold the case shut. Some of the other cases that I have looked at did not have that feature or if it did. the case was not that appealing.There is enough room for a pen to be inside of the case. but there is now place to clip it in so it does not fall out. Also. that is not a big deal either. The fact that there is even enough room for the ability to have a pen is a bonus to the over cases features.Im not that big of a fan of the elastic slots that hold the Kindle in place. in comparison to some of the other cases that have the clip in attachment along one side of the Kindle. But the elastic holds the Kindle 3 nicely. Since I just purchased the Kindle 3 I was a little hesitant to purchase this case because it is designed for the Kindle 2. Although it says that this case if for the Kindle 2. I read some other reviews saying that this also fits the Kindle 3.Ive read that there were some issues with having the elastic strap in slots and the ability to turn the power onoff or the volume up or down. It was weird getting used to at first. but its not a reason why I would not purchase this case.Overall. I am very pleased with the case and I would recommend it to other buyers.,4,1,2220

A33O0L7DTMBKUK,0,I bought my SP3 when I moved to the Washington DC area. and have to say it works great.  I am never lost and it can find nearly everything.  There are a few streets that have no numbers in Arlington. but otherwise it is pretty good.I have also used the SP when traveling to other areas.  The one issue that I have is that it has a hard time keeping a good signal in the city because of all the buildings.  DC is not too bad. but I have had bigger problems in places like NYC and Toronto with the tall skyscrapers.  If it is plotting a course for you. you might miss a turn because it loses the signal for a few seconds.  To make things worse. since there is such a grid in the cities. it often takes a while to recalculate the course. by which point you might be lost again.  I find times when I need to pull off and wait for the GPS to catch up.I would highly recommend it if you travel a lot. or are unfamiliar with an area. just be careful if you are using it for large cities.,4,1,980
A33OBVDZ5WD06Q,55,A very good tablet! Preferred over the Kindle Fire because of the Micro SD Card port. The Bu0026N Nook Store. unfortunately. is quite small lacking the apps available on the Google Play store. Its dualcore 1 GHz processor is more than enough to plow through any game Ive been able to throw at it. The 1 GB of RAM is also more than enough to handle anything. The battery life is also very good. lasting all day even if I play some graphics intensive games. Ive never had it die on me. The bezel around the screen is one of the few issues with this amazing tablet. it tends to collect dust around the corners and if youre a bit OCD like me. that will bug the crap out of you. Also. rooting is really the only way to unlock this tablets true potential. Thankfully there are many very easy options out there if you dont know what youre doing. If you dont want to risk anything. creating a bootable MicroSD card with Cyanogenmod 7 on it makes this tablet unstoppable. Theres also active development on the XDAForum with Cyanogenmod 10 which. asofrightnow. runs very smoothly with infrequent issues. I bought the device shortly before the Nexus 7 was announced. with the intent of using it for testing my apps that Im developing .I knew I would have to root it.. I really regret not waiting a few more weeks to get the Nexus 7. as it is more powerful .not that it matters. and better for developers .being Googles official tablet.. I have yet to get the ADB drivers to work on my computer. there seems to be an issue where it installs drivers for a USB Mass Storage device on Windows 7.Overall. an amazing tablet. Great battery life. more power than most people will ever need. the Micro SD card port is the best part over other tablets in the same market .Nexus 7. Kindle Fire. iPad Mini. etc... If you have a lot of data .movies. books. music. etc.. this is currently the best affordable choice.,4,1,1891
A33QYSQVS1H48J,1212,The stereo pickup is great. Better quality than my previous .RCA. headphones.Electronic Fan is wrong about sending the set back to the manufacture to change the battery. It is not difficult to change the battery. Changing the battery is similar to other electronic devices that require an exhausted battery change.For the price I recommend purchasing it.RJR,5,1,357
A33R6ST1MIGQ0A,3741,The folding blade wall charger died after 2 weeks.  Need to return it.  It would seem like these components should be simple enought that the failure rate would be nill. what a hassle.,1,0,184
A33SITUOTO9EH1,0,I just picked this up on a whim at a different store. They have a 90 day return policy.Without cracking the book I understood how to record.playback. change quality settings. set the clock etc. Very easy to understand the basic functions. Read the 25 page manual to get the advanced tips and features.I found the long play mode to be difficult to listen to. I could understand myself. especially if I spoke right into the microphone. but it was tedious listening. The 33 minute mode sounded just fine.I really like the voice activated recording. It turns off after 1 second of silence and reactivates instantly. It never cut off the beginning of a sentence  very nifty. This results in your 33 minutes capturing quite a bit of information since silent spots are 1 second max.Use the u0026quotHoldu0026quot button to avoid the problems some of the reviewers have mentioned about accidental recording. Their VCRs are probably blinking 12.00 right now. Its hard for me to understand how anyone could have that problem.Functionally it really only has 2 folders to store regular messages because the the third folder u0026quotSu0026quot is intended for scheduled messages. You can still use it like the other two folders. but it only holds 15 messages per day and is not quite as easy to navigate.Its a little small for my hand. A rectangular shape would  probably fit me better. but its really not an issue.I still may take it back if I find a unit with better quality long play sound  but this unit does what its supposed to do.Its cool looking...a real conversation starter. and small enough to tuck in any pant or shirt pocket. Youll keep it with you. but you might forget its there ..,4,1,1684
A33SPO6ZHRANFV,3232,All I can say is I love my Nook color!  I use it for reading and surfing the web.  The only draw back I see is the non user replaceable battery. Barnes and Noble does not replace the battery either .they ship you a refurb if you are still in warranty..  If you look online you can find a how to for replacing it yourself. otherwise consider it a disposable .or tethered to your power cord. when the battery needs replacing.  I also use an SD card which makes my Nook a full functioning Android.  Would I buy another YOU BET!  Netflix works great on my Nook also.,4,1,562
A33SPTHPA450SW,33,I bought this card and have regretted it ever since.  I have installed  this card on two machines. and it didnt work properly in either one.  I  have to manually assign IRQ numbers every time I reboot windows.  When I  tried to contact Pinnacle. they did not ever respond to my email.  I will  never buy something with Pinnacles name on it again.,1,0,346
A33TFX6J52RLYP,811,Nice mount for the price.Used it to mount a 32 Dynex in my sons room.  All the joints seem strong and it holds the TV  sturdy.  Havent noticed any sag in the arm as described by other reviewers.  But reading their description of the mount it seems to have been redesigned as the it didnt sound exactly like the mount I have. Who knows?Wrench provided to loosen the nuts on the mount is garbage. dont use it or you will strip them out. Dont even think of trying to use it to drive the lag bolts into the stud. Use a regular 12 inch boxend wrench or rachet u0026 socket.Main complaint is that there should be a way to attach the plate to the back of the TV and then attach plate to the mount arm as in other mounts I have bought.  I did take the last arm bolt out so I could attach plate to TV first. then simply lined them back up and had my son slide the bolt through and start the nut.  If it had this easy TV mount design I would have given it 5 satrs.For USD22 Id say its worth the money.,4,1,991
A33UD2JQGUVLAO,0,I am quite disappointed with this stereo. considering most all of my other RCA products have performed well. The sound is OK. but the radio tuner allows the stations to u0026quotfadeu0026quot. requiring constant retuning. The CD player turntable spins. but will no longer read any CD at all. The ac cord connection is a sloppy fit. allowing the power to disconnect at will. Save your money. buy something else.....this unit appears to suffer from poor build quality throughout.,2,0,477

A33XO9AM0RMI13,1112,If you are looking for a GPS that will get you into the woods and out again this is it. The GPS315 is a valuable piece of equipment for any outdoor enthusiast. A GPS unit is only as good as its antenna. The GPS315 has a very sensitive antenna that locks onto the satellites and keeps that lock under even the worst conditions. I have had this unit under very dense foliage in the rain and it still manages to aquire and hold a solid lock on the satellite signals .even while in my coat pocket!. I also found that using topoftheline batteries increased the units sensitivity .I have no idea why that is the case.. This unit is not WAAS enabled. however any latitude higher than 50 degrees north and WAAS is useless anyway. Even without WAAS it is very accurate. Side Note. Any GPS units accuracy is dependent on where the satellites are in the sky at that time. At the best satellite configuration the estimated position error .EPE.is 3m .10. or 7m .21. average. I have tested these values and they are correct. I have found that the current mapping GPS technology is too coarse in detail at this point to be of use in a backcountry hiking situation. If you are not planning to use your GPS for driving then forget the expensive mapping units. the GPS315 will serve you better and will cost you much less. The controls are laid out well and the various navigational screens are very customizable and very functional. The unit is solid and waterproof .I have never droped it in water but it has got rained on many times.. I recommend that you purchase a data cable with the unit since updating the firmware on the GPS315 will lead to increased performance. My unit came loaded with firmware v3.07 the latest release is v3.15. These continual upgrades. which are provided for free on the Magellan website. have virtually removed all bugs from the GPS315. I recommend this unit if you need a solid. easy to use. and accurate GPS.,5,1,1925
A33XRTAYW6T3RF,1414,I cant get my phone to put my pictures and videos on the SD Card. even the TMobile store tried. it would get to 2% downloading and then stay stuck like that for hours never completing the transfer. Not sure why this is happening.,2,0,229

A33YT7BJ81014N,11,I returned this item to the seller.I bought it and received at the import agents address.Alas~. my agent noticed that this item couldnt pass the custom gate because it was classified as a porno.I was depressed. I expected it as a Xmas present.I wrote to the seller and they agreed that I might return it back to them.The top rate was given to their quick response to my email request.But I am going to repurchase it someday.At present. I am planning to travel to Hawaii in one or two years.At there. I will reorder this item and I will get it at my resort address.I ordered National Geographic Hard Driver at the same day. and it passed the custom gate.I reviewed it and found its good quality.I had purchased it 6 years ago. The old scanning contents was not good. low resolution. slow speed. many CD. frequent exchange~all these week points was improved. I could see its contents at my 27inch iMac screen at 2560*1440 resolution. At that resolution. NGs image was awsome.I have to explore the Playboy Hard to find if it could maintain their image quality at that resolution.I believe this HDDform archive is the right form of the archive of the timeproven magazines.Have a good day. and thanks to who concerned.,5,1,1213

One  nuisance. though. the audioout level delivers muffled sound. making it a  necessity to fiddle with the receiver controls when starting to play a disc   probably those of us not owning fancy SDDSreceiversorwhatever gizmos  dont deserve sharp sound  but Ill live with with it.

A343QC2O211PHA,34,I wont rehash the Nook vs. Kindle issue. but well say I chose to buy the Nook because it just sounded better based on what people were saying. HOWEVER  Id say i made a huge mistake. I loved the way the Nook worked. but reliability becamea huge issue. My first Nook died within 24 hours. I figured it was just a bad egg. took it back. and they completely replaced it with a brand new one. My second one died 6 months later. I took it to two different stores and they were unable to fix it. Since it is still under warranty. They advised I call or email.  Over the last 3 months. Ive sent several emails and get autoresponses saying they have a higher volume of messages than usual. please call. Ive also racked up tons of cell phone minutes trying to call and have yet to break through before my lunch break is over. or my toddler starts wanting my attention. etc... I guess Ill just chalk it up to a total waste of my money and start saving for a Kindle!!!,1,0,956

A343Y6JLIXAEAH,0,I have had the nook color. and the nook tablet. I upgraded to the tablet and cant tell any difference. The Customer Service with Barnes and Knoble have limited hours. When I upgraded all my books I had paid for did not transfer to my tablet. and Customer Service told me I had to update my credit card information before I could get all the books I had previously purchased downloaded on my new unit. I protested to customer service that it was not relevent that I updated my information on items that were already paid for. To get all the items I had previously purchased I had to update my information. I was disappointed that many of the books offered from Amazon were not available on the nook so I purchased a Kindle Fire. The Kindle was priced lower. the sample readings of a book are larger. the screens change smother. and I greatly prefer it to the nooks and after being a customer with Amazon many years. I know that I can count on Amazon to have superior customer service. I purchase all my books now on the Kindle and recommend to everyone to choose Kindle over the nook.,2,0,1083
A345FVSAFD1E91,55,I just purchased this item for my husband for Christmas.  So far. we have been able to walk all around the house. including on other floors and still been able to hear without any problems.  We are looking forward to trying them outside this summer.  The only thing we noticed is that the headphones are hard to tighten.  Other than that. good sound quality and easy to set up  my husband did it with no problems.  Definately recommend.  Will see how it goes in the next few months.,4,1,482
A347SCMR3OO3PA,0,These were probably good tapes back in the day ... Unfortunately. now it seems. they are old.  Out of a pack of 6. I have two that are usable for recording.

A347WVDBAGPJTV,45,I feel fortunate after reading some of the other owners misfortunes with their 3109s.  At least mine gave me 2 good years of service before it started having problems with freezing up every other time I used it.Now that it just hit the 3 year mark I finally have a serious problem...  It ate a dvd and the tray refused to open.  I took it apart and pulled the dvd out but it still will not open the tray door.  I can see the internal tray sliding with the cover off but I dont have a clue how to fix it.I definetly wont take it in for service since I will probably pay more for repairing it than a newer u0026 higher quality unit will cost.It did have some great features. the zoom was a great feature especially with the letterbox movies. The slow play was also a great feature.  If I had to do it all over again I would not have purchased the dual tray system.  It was a headache with more moving parts that eventually broke down in 23 years forcing a costly repair or a purchase of a new player.Planned obsolence used to be the bread and butter of the automotive industry but it now appears the electronics industry. at least Toshiba. is capitalizing on this concept.I think Ill try another brand this next time around. perhaps one that will last longer than 3 years and comes with a backlit remote. but I still want one with the zoom and slow play features....,3,0,1364

Gradually they got worse and now the color of the screen fades and gets dark as I read.I called customer support and they told me they can ship me a new nook and then I send the old one back. I was thinking. great. how easy. Well that was 2 months ago and they have yet to get around to sending  me a new nook. I have tried calling customer service I have waited three times for over 15 minutes before hanging up. Extremely disappointed overall with my experience with nook and barnes and noble. I should have bought a kindle.,3,0,644

A34B63SW6KWJEY,0,I was thoroughly disappointed in the performance and ease of installation of this video card. If youre looking to by an upgrade and your computer has an integrated video card. dont bother with this item. I spent thirty minutes on the phone .after being on hold for forty!. with the 3dfx support  people and they still couldnt tell me what to do. I wont even begin to  try and tell all the things wrong with the installation. Suffice to say  that the instructions do not match what you see when you do it yourself. Do  yourself a favor and buy a TNT2 card. youll thank me later for it.,1,0,584
A34C36WAU8V300,514,3dfx started off great at first. I purchased this board with the expectations of it delivering like it predecessors. but I was wrong. This board. in my opinion. was a rush job to match the tnt2 and other high performance video cards. hoping the the loyal supporters of the voodoo  cards would again jump on the band wagon. The installation is easy. but  getting it to work with your system is a major under taking with few ever  becoming successful. It was a major disappointment to me. I could never get  it to work. but Im not alone. Check out the hundreds of other complaints  to 3dfx on their own message. Many people are very disappointed.  I am one of many.,1,0,663

A34KL9XGJ22JWG,0,It is cool to have such the technology to listen to music at not have it skip. But Diamond needs work in many areas before they have a great product. First the battery location is not well placed or it needs a better  locking mechanism.mine has tape holding it closed.. Second. their customer  service really needs improvement. My first player didnt work correctly. SO  after calling long distance on my dime they sent me out a new one which  intially didnt work.

A34KX8DV4184ZP,56,Well i purchased this card for video capture not for gameing and after four months of tweaking i finnally got it working correctly.I have to say it commands my whole system.other add ons dont like this card .webcams and  other usb toys.The software that came with it for video capture is nice but  not so user friendly and it doesnt compress like people might think for avi  formating.The quality of the video is excelent.I also had to download new  drivers .after only four months.Overall its a good card for the  money.Remember you get what you pay for in video capture cards. And in this  price range this is as good as it gets.Oh one more thing the captureing  devices are not reconized by microsofts netmeeting so you are unable to  hold netmeetings useing your camcorder with this card.Thats a real  dissapiontment for me.,4,1,828

A34MS72A45UK2D,1922,I read the advertisement for the dice mini cam and made the mistake of buying without waiting for others reviews. I bought 4 of them. one for myself and three others for friends so we could get a break on shipping. Mine lasted through a few minutes and it did work as advertised for the few minutes I ran it. I then chrged it a second time and after that could not get it to turn on properly and do anything whatsoever. My friends had similar problems to what others have experience. They didnt like the controls and instructions. They all failed to meet up with expectations. Too bad. I was OK with mine though I had not run mine over 5 minutes to test battery lifetime. Too many problems. dont buy them. You get what you pay for and at that rate these should worth 10 cents each. In our case we are in Canada and shipping is a killer.,1,0,836

A34PNHKNM05TXD,0,Having used a paper Daytimer for years. I was a little skeptical about going electronic with my datebook and phone listing.  Boy. have I been converted!  The Palm IIIx .my second Palm  the first being a III. is. for  me. a great value.It has enough memory for anyone but the most  compulsive notetaking. yellow page totin workaholic among us.  .I  download an average of 300 Palm formatted web pages a day and have had no  problem with space in memory at all.  I also keep about 700 phone listings  and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times.  It has the  improved screen and processor versus the III.  And it has the benefit of  the Palm community of software developers that is what sets Palm devices  apart from Windows CE .and other. devices.I like the foldover cover  both for protection and for the Star Trek communicator look .. and feel.  The backlight takes a little getting used to.  It is not useful at all for  dim daylight use. but works just fine in dark situations.I really want  the Palm Vx for the sexy size and industrial feel. but I have no real  reason to move away from a device that does everything I need and more .and  costs a lot less..,4,1,1176
A34PNHKNM05TXD,3031,Lightweight. portable and simple.  These words describe both the HotSync cradle that came with my Palm IIIx and this cable which I just purchased.  However. if you travel a lot. and sync to a laptop or second computer. this  cable is the way to go.I takes up virtually no room in a laptop bag. and  can fit in virtually any luggage pocket .and also a suit pocket..There  is no other software to install.  Just pull the cable out of the bag.  attach to your PC and Palm and sync using the HotSync icon on the Palm  itself.One way that it could be improved would be with a button on the  cable end itself which would trigger the HotSync.  This would most likely  make the cable more expensive and possibly less reliable over the long  term. however.  All in all. a welldesigned and utterly useful product.,4,1,803

A34PUDAI8ANEQ5,1,As digital cameras with better resolution appear. the Kodak DC210 seems perhaps outdated.  But it is not.  For pictures to insert into web pages. it is perfect.  The DC210 has a large LCD for viewing photos. and a two to one optical zoom lens.  Using CF memory. getting pictures from the camera to your computer is very easy.  It even works on my Amiga 3000.  If there is any problem with the camera. it is the short battery life.  You will go through a lot of AA alkalines if you use the LCD much. but that is not a serious problem.  Just dont pay a whole lot for the DC210. as new cameras in the 1.1 megapixel class are now under USD100.,4,1,639

I thought it had something to do with the range. but after playing with it for an hour or so. I discovered that this device *needs* to be plugged directly into your wall jacks to work as intended.  If you plug it into a surge protector or UPS .like I had done.. you get a bunch of noise and really .bad. connections.Now that Ive plugged both units directly into wall jacks. my FAX machine is now happily working.,4,1,539
A34Q4UGXGMZGT6,1718,muy mal producto. hace interferencia o ruido. tiene poca ganancia y la clavija entra muy apretada en el iPhone. No lo recomiendo.,1,0,129
A34Q67LBSP9ZQE,0,This is a great product for the shower. Obviously it is waterproof. and the reception is better than my mediumhigh end stereo tuner on some distant stations. The 6 pushbuttons are a much better way to go that twisting a knob. This is my second one. Unfortunately something in the volume control went highwire .it became constantly super loud. and changing the batteries was not the answer. I still give it 4 stars because it is a great performer otherwise.,4,1,456
A34QG9EZ0BKE4W,11,This form of media is extinct and I wanted to have a backup to my exsisting floppy drive. I havent actually used it yet. but my buying experience on Amazon has been outstanding as always! Never had a problem! AAA+++,4,1,215
A34QWZUNR0WNWM,0,Good drive. seems to read floppies more reliably than an old internal drive that I was using to try to recover old data.  Used on Windows 7 x64 with no drivers or installation needed. just plugandplay.,5,1,201
A34RSL86E38BGA,22,This is a great product the shipping was very fast. I still dont understand how it reads thru the fabric but it works. Suction cups are still holding,5,0,149
A34SGF61E4QCKK,22,Wish the screen were a bit brighter u0026 that current books were available for less. It works great though and Im looking forward to leaving heavy hardback books at home.,4,1,171
A34SS6TEI797SA,0,Bought this converter years ago for Olympus C4040.  Its very lightweight and compact.  The lens quality is very good and seems not reduce sharpness of your camera.  With 46mm thread. it will work with many modern compact fixedlens cameras with appropriate lens tube and stepping ring.  I am using it on a Lumix LX7 with a simple 3746mm step up ring. thanks to its light weight.,4,1,377
A34SW8WTVDKDTN,0,I purchase this modem and all I get is a no dial tone. I swap the card to a different pci slot and still get the same thing no dial tone. I just  cant win.  Im returning this junk of modem.  Thats why they are so  CHEAP. I wont even recommend this modem to anyone even if they get it for  free. Why should I pay for tech support! probably because this modem is a  junk.  This is the first time I write a negative response about a product.  There is always a first.,1,0,464
A34TSHMQXI0IRE,11,My daughter love this tablet I also think it was just the fit for her. Shes 17. My whole family think its nice also.,4,1,116
A34UCP9NIG0I9T,11,Ive had my nook wifi for several months now and I must say that I absolutely love it. I was an English major in college and I read tons of books so for a long time I went back and forth between the kindle and the nook. I love amazon. but the nook appealed to me more. I finally bought the nook just after I graduated because I had some leftover graduation money and I am so glad I did. The only thing I might have done differently would be to have paid the extra fifty dollars for the free 3g. I dont really use the web browser. but it would be nice to have since I dont get web on my phone. Anyway. the browser is actually not that bad. if you view a regular web page you have to pan side to side to see the whole thing. so for emails I just use the mobile version of yahoo and gmail since I just have to scroll up and down. The browser works well for basics. like email. checking movie times. and a quick wikipedia search.The nook really isnt any heavier than most books .except maybe mass market paperbacks. and I find it to be very comfortable to hold .though usually I prefer holding it with a cover on so its more like a book.. I love the way the books can be organized in different categories. Usually I just organize them by date last opened though since I read more than one book at a time and can therefore have all the books Im reading at the top of the list. I also love the touch screen its not perfect .iPod touch and iPhone touch screens are much better.. but I dont mind. The games that are included are absolutely perfect for me too. I love chess and sudoku and hopefully theyll add more in the future to be downloaded. but Im happy with just those two. The screens contrast is great and while the new Kindle says it has better contrast. I honestly dont think Id need it to be better. I can read perfectly fine and pictures look great on the screen. Another thing that I love about the nook is that you can personalize the screensaver and background .I know thats not really important. but I like having my favorite pics on my nook..Anyway. Im really happy with the nook and I think it was well worth the money. An ereader will never take the place of actual books for me. I still buy both. I usually read free classics and pay for the books that I know I wont really ever want to read again .like the paperbacks I used to buy from target or walmart.. Other books that I know I will want to keep to reread. I buy the physical copy. I love the price of ebooks too. Usually they are either equal to or less than the cost of regular books and you can sometimes find them for super cheap! Ive never tried the kindle. but honestly Id say theyre probably fairly equal when it comes down to it .I mean really reading a book on a screen doesnt vary that much.. If you just go with whichever one sounds better to you. then youll probably be happy. I know I am!,5,1,2868
A34UP6R06QIEHH,1313,These invert ambient sound in lower frequencies. feeding the inverted signal into the speakers on top of the sound from your cd player. etc. The effect is that low frequency ambient sounds such as the roar of jet engines. the drone of bus tires against asphalt. traffic. loud airconditioners. etc. are cancelled. That lets you listen to music at a normal .non deafening. volume in an otherwise noisy environment. EXCELLENT for destressing a commute or plane trip. Compared to other headphones. I rate these GOOD but not the best. The Sony MDR 7506. for example. gives somewhat clearer and more accurate reproduction of classical instrumental musicpiano. cello. acoustic guitar... but the 7506 lacks the noise cancelling feature you need to listen to such music in a noisy environment. FYI I tried the Bose and didnt think they worked any better than these. though they were USD100 more expensive.,5,1,896
A34UV2QYB25I8N,7778,A great cam for the cost .I paid USD30 for it with a rebate. but lacks some features available in other cams...like hue. saturation. etc. The image is great. but slightly yellowish in my case. so I thought Id change the hue  and realized theres no setting to do that. The image turns out well with  good lighting. Other than that. setting up this cam is very easy. all the  more so if you get the USB version.,3,0,409
A34VKO642QP76Z,5656,Fits like a glove and very streamline. Works perfectly and keeps your computer safer from the stealing  temptation of others.,4,1,125
A34WISS43CVLDP,0,...you must unplug the microphone unit to hear any replaysounds.  Ill hack it in the future in order to allow sounds while its plugged in.,4,1,138
A34WNTSH1BCJAQ,0,Even after being told a million times to not be cheap. I went and did it again.  Please. go pay a little more and get a better keyboard.  The wrist rest doesnt come off. requiring me to completely pull out my keyboard tray and sit three feet away from my monitor just to reach the keys .though I guess thats better for my eyes..  Im tempted to get a hacksaw and cut the thing off.  Also. the main Enter key started sticking within a month of buying it. and Ive gone out of my way to keep food away from it.  Its so much fun watching 50 windows open unstoppably. one after the other. because your Enter key is stuck.  I havent noticed that the keys are that noisy. though when the space bar releases it is noticeably louder than the other keys.  All in all. I guess this keyboard is okay. but if I had a doover Id definitely buy something a little nicer.,3,0,853
A34WO5SMXCZVR4,33,I owned a Nook Color so I know how this works with Bu0026N. To me. this feels like a Nook Color with improved and updated OS. Its a solid device but its lacking the appeal of the iPad 2 or Kindle Fire.,4,1,201
A34X6WWNQZ1RMB,22,These are really not worth the money.  To use. I first started by having to track down the memorex software templates .software was not included. and link address in the instructions didnt work!..  Once I got the software installed. it was super simplistic and only had a couple templates.  I bought this because I wanted the convenience and thought it would only take minutes to make a couple inserts.  There were only a few templates that were really out of style and the tools provided for doing your own designs and text were so rudimentary that it would have taken me hours to make something that looked good.  While searching for the software templates to print these. I stumbled across other programs that had really nice templates that you just had to type text into.  That would have been preferable to having to make text boxes yourself and line everything up.  The centering on the software was also bad  I followed instructions for printing out a test page and folding and adjusting offsets in software to line things up.  When I compared my printed alignment page to the perforations in the inserts they didnt line up even after I ran through all the alignment steps!  Dont waste your time or money.  I wound up finding some templates built into my word processor. printed some inserts on blank paper. and cut them out by hand.  Would have saved a ton of time if I had just started doing that in the first place.  Now I have a bunch of these perforated sheets left that I dont even want to bother to use.,1,0,1517
A34XHTETLN5WHD,11,great product .great price the only thing that should be noted is the mounting point is not centered its offset. so if you are mounting over fireplace as i am this creates a positioning problem. i worked it out though just wished it was part of the discription.,4,1,261
A34XU754HVA02N,0,I got this MP3 player after seeing it in a magazine article about cool new technology.  The price was .and still is. a little steep. but I love my little Rio anyway.  The software that comes with it is pretty easy to use.  and its not too hard to connect it to your computer.  I dont like the  fact that it can really only hold 6 or 7 songs. unless you buy extra  memory. which is very. very expensive.  I also wish it came with an FM  tuner. for when I just feel like listening to the radio without carrying  around my big ol Walkman.  But overall. its a nice thing to have very  lightweight. doesnt skip. excellent sound quality. and runs on just one AA  battery!,5,1,665
A34XU754HVA02N,1718,My dad got two of these so that I could video conference with my family from college.  I was really excited. until I discovered that it was practically impossible to get a connection going.  My dad works with  computers for a living. and even he couldnt figure out how to make these  things work.  Before you buy one of these. make sure you have. like. the  person who designed it on hand. or youll never get it working  ..,2,0,423
A34Y5JARAI7DNQ,33,What can I say? These are cheap. wellconstructed. and do their job perfectly. Highly recommended!,5,0,97
A34ZKAYOKYLR7E,23,I needed this after playing some really old tapes on .2. of my VCRs. which essentially trashed play back on both.I chose this for the super saver shipping and the fact it seemed to work fine for other reviewers.After opening the package. the liquid bottle was well sealed and intact .had to pierce the opening which appeared to be sealed..Put a few drops in the drop window and ran it through all .3. of my VCRs ... it fixed the .2. problematic units straight away.The cleaning tape fed into the units just fine and there were no jams or hang ups.Overall. a functional product that works as advertised.,5,1,602
A352ONXZT2WTGD,23,I Expected To Receive Software With This Product So I Wasnt Able To Use it. In The Future There Needs To Be A More Detailed Product Description,1,0,143
A3533HCZPJRD3I,0,I bought this radio based on reviews and newsgroup messages saying that this was a really good radio at pulling in weak signals. Thats just what I needed as I work in a metal building and I can barley get 3 stations. So I bought this with that in mind. I get it out of the box and I can hardly tune in WLS and I live 30 miles from Chicago. So I try FM the tuner numbers dont match up with the frequency and I can barley get any stations at all and they are all so static filled that I turned it off and back in the box it went.  I calling today to see if I can return it.,1,0,571
A353ZMB5ELO33N,815,The instructions were a little hard to follow.  The product works fine.,4,0,71
A3541CY4KV2K3Y,23,The filter does make a difference as compared to AWB. However I have had problems using it on my 85mm @ 1.2.The test photo itself came incorrect.I purchased the 82mm neutral filter but it does not get attached to the Bu0026W UV filter on my 2470 2.8L II.Other wise its a good product.,4,1,284
A3548FPAV9LC0W,0,Followed the instructions. but head cleaner did not work at all. even after trying it in three VCRs. Static appeared. per instructions. but then cleaner tape just stopped. and regular TV returned. Cost for postage to return item would be more than item itself. so just dropped the matter. Would not order again.,1,0,311
A354G99EYVQQ43,0,I own 4 radio stations.3 FMs and 1 AM. and have looked for a portable  radio that will deliver great sound in both bands plus excellent reception.  This does it. Both the FM and AM reception are excellent even without  external antennas. The AM section is so good. my wife thought we were  listening to FM. There is a 2way speaker system plus separate bass and  treble controls. which provide good fidelity. The GE SuperRadio 3 is  everything Ive read about. It is powered by AC cord or batteries. making  it a great goanywhere radio.,5,1,534
A3556UAMASCD0B,1717,I have only had this camera for two weeks. but found all the features easy to use.  Its a great little camera if you are taking pictures for web use.  The only drawback is that it takes so long to download to your computer.  Im not sure if that is true with all digital cameras.  You most certainly  will need an AC adapter. I also find that 8MB is plenty of storage unless  you went on a vacation and were not able to download the pictures. but then  I really wouldnt recommend using this digital camera for important  pictures just quick shots for using on the web media.,4,1,573
A355B4SHDN0EKC,0,I just received the Grundig 960 and am very pleased thus far.The cabinet is very nice and looks much like a similar vintage Grundig that sits in my fathers study. If you are looking for a high power shortwave radio set then youll want to pass on this one but If like me you want a very nice radio with great looks and decent AmFM performance then this radio is for you. As others have stated though there is one thing to note.this radio is big so make sure youve the space for it.,4,1,480
A355B9HM87SFHE,11,Let me start by saying. there is nothing wrong with the Landware keyboard.  It works wonderfully.  But having just bought the Palm Portable keyboard .folding model.. I have to admit that the Landware doesnt quite match up.  The keys are smaller and the case is bigger so if portability isnt a big issue for you. then I heartily recommend this model. as it can be USD20 to USD30 cheaper than the folding one.  But overall. the folding keyboard is a much better solution.,3,0,469
A355B9HM87SFHE,1616,There really isnt too much to say about the cradle.  Drop in the Palm. hit the button and it syncs.  However. save yourself a few dollars and buy the serial cable instead.  It is cheaper. more portable. and most importantly for me. easier to plug into my Palm because I keep it secured in a carrying case.,3,0,305
A357KQXUWYAGSA,910,Not what I was looking for ......... was looking for a cable that I can also update the StreetPilot with.,2,0,105
A357NO5CK9YDP7,0,I have owned this. and had to have it replaced during the first year.My wife has one. and it stopped working after the one year warranty expired.,3,0,145
A35810SNK0KIM8,11,This is the second Psion I have owned and it is better and easier to use.  It does everything my desktop computer does and more.  I love the voice recorder that I use while driving the car when I cant write or type.  Using this and my cell phone I have my office everywhere I go.  I think I read somewhere that psion is going to incorperate a cellphone in one of their upcoming models.  I applaud that.  I only regret the lack of compatibility with my iMac.,5,1,457
A3582JD8IFEJ21,35,Forget the other cameras.  TRV310 and the TRV510 are the best ones for today... by far. Dont loose your time looking for other options because no other portable camcorder .in this category. can provide the features and  the quality of these cameras. Ive played with my TRV310 for about 10 days  and I am really impressive with this camera.  This is my fifth camcorder  .all 8MM and HI8. that I have used and this the best camera that I have  seen.Some comments...The LCD screen on the 310 is amazing.  Certainly the best LCD that I have seen in my life.  It is clear. bright.  sharp and big... 3.5 inches.  The color is truer. It is a real pleasure to  play my videotapes in any place with no connection with TVs.  This is one  of the most important features of this camera and you have to consider that  in your analysis. You will use it a lot.The 20X optical zoom is enough  and works fine .much better than my old hi8 camera..The PAUSEs are  terrific.  It is impossible to avoid the PAUSE key.  Try to press the SLOW  key and you will get a limpid and crystalline image.I have lots of  videos recorded on 8 and hi8 format.  The 310 is capable to play black  perfectly any videotape on these formats. This camera is the right choice  for everyone that have 8 and hi8 tapes.  Dont loose your time thinking to  buy a miniDV camcorder. you will have much more flexibility using the  digital camera that supports your old tapes. with the same quality and  flexibility.  By the way. the hi8 tapes are cheaper than the miniDV  tapes.I didnt see notable difference between the regular video and S  video hookups to my TV.The included battery in not sufficient and an  additional battery is very important.The infrared nightshot works very  fine .do you think that is it really important ? ..The 16.9 aspect ratio  feature is wonderful  At the beginning you dont give so much attention on  that. but when you start to use you will love this alternative.  If you  have a 16.9 aspect ratio television this feature will be fantastic for you.  If you are considering to buy this kind of TV .to see your DVDs. this  can be a considerable feature to consider.One of the big things and  rarely I see comments is the SOUND.  The PCM System is fantastic.  I  connect the camcorder to my receiver system and I was surprised with the  quality. clear and powerful sound.  There is a huge difference between this  PCM AUDIO SYSTEM and the audio system in my old hi8 camera. Normally. when  we study to buy a camcorder we dont invest so much time analyzing the  audio. we keep focus on the video system and dont give importance to the  audio.  I am sure that the AUDIO SYSTEM of this digital camera will  surprise you positively.  You will feel the big difference if you connect  the camera to a prologic Dolby surround sound receiver or a digital  receiver.  If you have a home theater system with Adobe Digital 5.1...THE BAD THING. The missing feature on the 310 is audio dubbing.  For  this kind of camera this feature will be important and convenient.  I would  like  to record narration or add a sound track on the camera after Ive  recorded the video. Based on the manual I can do this editing the video on  my PC. but until now I didnt try it.  So. I really dont know if it will  work well...GRAINY VIDEO. I read some comments about to make sure you  have plenty of light to avoid a slightly grainy on the video.  This is true  but not at all.  The illumination is not a bid deal...  Dont make your  decision using this comment as important !  In most of the 95% of the  time you will be recording with enough light to make a brilliant and  wonderful video.... So. the other 5% of the time you can face poor light  and you will have a little bit grainy in your video...  And so what ?  The important here is that other cameras have the same problem. so it is  not a decisive factor for buyers...  Dont waste time with these  comments...Finally... I made a very deep analysis comparing the  TRV510 and TRV310. the 310 is probably the good choice because it has the  most advanced features with less cost.Repeating a comment that I saw  below... The 310 is LIGHT YEARS beyond the other ones...,5,1,4178
A359HK9KFJG24M,7173,I also have an Olympus D340R Camera. and I have an Olympus 16mbcard and a Scandisk 16mb card.  The panoramic feature isnt worth paying .the extra money..  Instead of buying one Olympus 16mb card. buy two Scandisk 16mb cards.,2,0,224
A359YMYQG32WJI,78,It may be that my cds are scratched. It plays better but if you have a cheap car cd player or old cds just buy a new audio system. It will get me by until I purchase a car with digital inputoutput vs this old technology,3,0,219
A35AEEEFLYYI9L,14,Ive had my Olympus D340R camera since April of 1999 and I just cant say enough good things about it. I love it. It is the BEST camera that Ive ever owned or used. It has so many functions and the software that comes with it is fabulous. You just cant take a bad picture with this camera.  The ONLY downside is that it does use up batteries quite a bit so Ive got  an AC adapter for mine for when I use it indoors. Also when the camera malfunctioned .my fault. water got  spilled on it. Olympus fixed it for free under warranty and had it back to  me within two weeks working perfectly again. I have not ever had such a  positive experience in dealing with a company before. Their warranty  service was excellent and their products are even better.,5,1,747
A35AM2F6K2IJFA,5252,The product works as expected. but the item that was advertised was a 16gb Tablet. I was told. after ordering and paying for the item. that a mistake was made and the advertised price was for an 8gb tablet. I was credited only USD10 and received an 8gb tablet. This was an error on Amazons part that they would not honor. I felt like that was  bait and switch  approach and was unhappy with the customer service,2,0,411
A35C8VC6BS3MUF,22,Keys dont function like the original. Still works thoe . sometimes letters wont type when pressed. Has a cheap feel to it.,2,0,122
A35CJKEWKRF09P,0,Dollar for dollar. this unit cant be beat.  I listened to the higher priced units as well as the lower priced ones.  At USD169.99 you cant get a better sound. I spend a lot of time on boats and beaches along North  Carolinas coast and this box is the answer.  Of course its not  indestructable but with a little common sense and carefull handling this  box should serve you many years.  As for Amazon.com Ive got nothing but  good things to say.  I actually drove 37 miles to the nearest JVC dealer  and they couldnt even come within USD25.00 of the price.  Yea I know...I  spent money just driving that far but being new to computer shopping I just  wanted to prove a few things to myself.  Amazon.Com delivered in 5 days  right to my front door and in a weatherproof jacket to boot!  My credit  card number seems to be safe as well as the personal info I supplied.  No  one has hasseled me or bombarded me with advertizements  either.  Bottom  line to all this?  Buy it and buy it thru Amazon.Com!,5,1,999
A35D2D86EQXZ6O,2324,I had been looking in office supply stores for this item but they all seemed to sell it at a much higher cost .USD14.95USD20.95..  This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was hard to believe!,4,1,204
A35DRSW5VAV7WR,0,I have a new system with Windows ME. and I might as well unplug the speakers.  This sound card is worthless unless youre running a system from five years ago.  The problem doesnt end there. this sound card crashes games and locks the computer up.  Ive tooled around with other generic cards from companies that are now out of business. and they ran better.  Worthless.,1,0,368
A35DY7DWW5OX0W,313,It doesnt say so on this item. but this roll only has 26 feet.  That might sound like a lot. but thats 11.5 cents for 3 inch label.  Thats a ripoff that whole roll of tape couldnt have more than USD2 in manufacturing costs.,1,0,223
A35EC54TIQQN01,318,It has everything you need in a tablet. except it doesnt have a camera. 3G or GPS. personally I dont need them. But guess what... It is built in microphone.. That is good. I like to sing.O.k. this tablet has a good touch response. you can touch even the smallest links. the screen is extremely crisp and beautiful 900X1440 pixel the highest resolution in the 7 inch tablets!... I was amazed at how beautiful google maps is displayed. I loved it. It has a dualcore 1.3 ghz processor and 1 Gb of Ram. it is quick and very responsive but dont abuse. it is only a tablet.I decided to get this tablet instead of the Asus Nexus 7 because it is lighter. it only weights 11 Oz. this is a good factor if you are planning to use it for long periods of time. I use it for reading colored magazines and illustrative books. Besides it is easy to grip.The battery last about 11 hours if you use it only for reading. and about 7 hrs if you watch videos or use it in wifi mode.The new software updates give you access to google Play. It couldnt be easier. You dont deal with any annoying promos and the charger and wire is included.,5,1,1116
A35EHT3XW238CS,22,I dont know.  I followed instructions but the cleaning didnt really make a difference.  It was supposed to eliminate skips.  Vendor shipped promptly.,1,0,149
A35G3Z1R2A9FP,0,I like the Nook tablet for reading however. we also bought it for the internet.  Unfortunately. I discovered that there is no way to filter the internet.  Since adult websites are accessible. I need to give this tablet a low rating.  Id rather pay more money for the iPad and NOT have to worry about my kids going on inappropriate websites.  Very unfortunate.,2,0,359
A35GN1UJ24SZ98,3,Having read the previous comment on poor sound quality I must write in  I have found the sound quality on the v90 more than adequate.  I frequently use the v90 for recording a class and every voice in the discussion is  understandable.  And my most common use for it. taking personal notes. I  speak directly into the microphone and for that the sound quality is  excellent.  I find it hard to believe that someone could not understand  what they were saying into a v90.Also. I must say that the voice  operated recording is quite good. unlike many voice operated recorders the  first part of a recording is not cut out due to a delay in starting to  record.  I keep my v90 atttached to my pants on a carabiner and in my  pocket  and with me at all times.Please bear in mind that this is  not a personal audio player. if you want that get a recordable mp3 player.  for its purpose  recording personal notes. reminders. lectures. meetings.  thoughts. etc  it does marvelously.,5,1,975
A35GZ4MLDU6GTA,7879,Dont be fooled by the review. it can ONLY connect up to a Max. of 36.6.  Although it does work. albeit slow. very well.,3,0,119
A35HG6OTJDFKH5,67,i bought this item from a recommendation from my friend. out of the box i could communicate up to 14 mile with the attena attached that came with the CB. in my car without antenna i can only hear and broadcast up to 500 feet. this of course is not an issue with the product just with lack of CB assessories. overall highly recommended,5,1,334

A35IODQB74EU2H,22,For its price. this product is excellent. It is light weight and nifty looking. with good sound quality.,4,0,104

A35LU9RG45QFEB,0,I will attempt to review the GE 72887 Superadio III Portable AMFM Radio below.  I will focus on these categories. AM receptionperformance. FM receptionperformance. quality and price vs. overall value.First before I begin the review here is some information about me.  I am an avid fan of AM radio.  I have several favorite stations from as many as 250 miles away to as few as 5 miles away.  I listen to AM talk almost all the time when listening to radio.  I also listen at all times of day.  I also live in a deep valley and have a very hard time getting any decent radio signal.  I own several radios. which are a clock radio. a Magnavox home stereo. an antique handheld Panasonic transistor radio .model R1052.. the Sony ICFSW7600GR shortwave radio and the GE Superadio III.AM ReceptionPerformanceThis radio has fantastic reception on the AM band.  Far better than my other radios!  The stations come in clear and strong.  Stations are easy to dial in for maximum signal.  The nearly 8inch ferrite antenna is why this radio is truly deigned for AM reception.FM ReceptionPerformanceI have had no trouble getting many different FM stations on this radio.  The whip antenna is very adequate and I am very satisfied with my ability to receive FM radio signals.  This radio does out perform my other radios here as well.QualityI am satisfied with the quality of this radio.  It is a large radio and heavy.  The casing feels strong and the metal speaker grill is a big plus.The volume. bass and treble knobs do feel slightly cheap.  I can hold the knob and flex it up and down some.  Not very much but I do think that if this radio did fall and somehow land on the knob the wrong way it could break.  However with proper handling and care I do not see any problem with the knobs.  They do turn very smoothly and feel good they also have a very sensitive adjustment that is great for really dialing in that perfect sound!The speakers are of great quality and in my opinion one of this radios features that make this radio such a wonderful radio.  The sixinch woofer and twoinch tweeter bring this radio to life!  This portable radio sounds almost as full and as dynamic as my home stereo system.  Now remember that this is a portable radio with two front firing speakers.  It will not compete with a home stereo that has two separate speaker cabinets.  However this is one of the best sounding portable radios I have ever had the pleasure to listen too.  This radio is capable of very loud volumes.  I like to listen at setting 1 .0 min10 max. when the radio is sitting next to me.  The audio quality of this radio due to its large woofer and tweeter make this radio second to none to any of my other portable radios that I own or have listened too.The tuner on this radio is smooth and sensitive to movement so dialing in on weak signals is easy.  The numbers on the dial are inaccurate .as are almost all non digital radios.. but on my radio not by a whole lot.  I have had no problem adjusting to the offset.The onoff button is on top of the radio. it is the only button on the top of the radio so finding it in the dark is easy!  The other buttons and knobs are laid out in a very logical way and are very accessible in the dark so listening before bed is easy.  That for me is a big plus!  The radios handle is also very strong and I feel very safe using it to carry the radio.Price vs. Overall ValueFor the price I paid with Amazon .USD35.94. this radio is worth every penny!  I highly recommend this radio to anyone who wants to bring AM radio to life.  Hear what is really out there.  Make AM radio a pleasure to listen too.  This is the best radio in this price range by far and competes with radios 34 times its price. that says a lot.  If you are looking for a much better radio at a reasonable price this radio is a must buy!  This is the only radio I use anymore.  While it may not have all the extras of many other radios this radio was designed to do just one thing. that is to deliver the best AMFM radio experience and it does that wonderfully!  A must have for any AM radio fan!,5,1,4092

A35MUY1T5C335X,0,Im using this lock with a relatively new HP Pavilion laptop. and it seems to be a very nice product for what its intended to do  protect your computer in reasonably secure areas. As others have said. it wont stop a bolt cutter. and it could probably be picked given enough time. But in an environment like an office or restaurant. it should be fine.The cable is flexible. and nicely coated so that it doesnt scuff surfaces. The lock mechanism itself works smoothly and seems quite sturdy. and it hasnt scuffed or scratched the laptop even after numerous uses. The only real concern I see. the lock mechanism is significantly bigger in diameter than older locks Ive used so if theres some other connector very close to the security slot on your laptop. you may not be able to use the lock and the connector at the same time.,4,1,823

A35RQAGE28CAF3,1,There is a widespread problem with RCA dvd machines being able to play. A Bugs Life.  This movie is one of the best ever made for the format. and the first all digital transfer of a film.  I suggest if you have an RCA  brand .or Proscan. dvdplayer that you get this disk and see if it works.  Usually. the player wil throw back an error message after five minutes.  saying u0026quotIncompatible Disku0026quot.  If you do put it in enough times.  you may be able to get it to play on the forth or fifth try.  However. if  you are not happy with this performance. you may take your player back.  because this is a manufacturers defect and is subject to a full refund no  matter how long youve had your dvdplayer.  I think the problem may be as  rampant as 1 in every 2 players.  Be sure to check your system out.,1,0,810

A35SM0FTFOW5CS,11,i recently purchased a rio pmp300. its great. id like it if it had a little bit more included memory but if it was that important to me id have bought the rio 500. i usually listen to mp3s made from my cds or  downloaded from mp3.com or using napster. i was pleasantly surprised at the  quality of the music on the sampler that came with my rio player. anyone  buying a rio should take the time to listen to some of these songs. .on the  minus side. they dont list the artists. only the song names.. all in all a  great player if you are willing to trade lower cost for lower less memory  .actually. a rio 300 with a 99 dollar 32mb upgrade card would be cheaper  .after 50 dollar rebate. than rio 500. additionally. the player is  attractive. wellmade and goes forever and a day on a single double A.  great sound and small size are real pluses as well.,4,1,853
A35SXNALXC54WU,910,I was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the VCR.  This did nothing to help or fix the problem.  Years ago I used a similar product with great results for a similar problem.... is it because the VCR is old or this cleaner???,3,0,240
A35TCV053U9AHN,0,For the price it works fine though i have to admit it worries me.  It says it can fit a 55 inch T.V. i put a 48  TV on it and it by all means fit. but the thin metal bars which bolt to the TV are obviously bowing under the weight.  Ill give it this though. my TV has hung on it for probably over a year now and it hasnt fallen yet. though i can say each day i am waiting for it too.  The full swing motion is nice works as expected. we occasionally turn it toward the kitchen when we are all in there doing things.  I would give it a 5 star but the thin support bars always worry me so that keeps it at a 4.,4,1,607

A35VTCF8QVMYAH,0,While Handspring launched the Visor to compete directly with the Palm IIIx. it falls short of this great PDA.The Haqndspring may *advertise* expandability. but it has yet to deliver.  Also. you can never upgrade the  OS it carries. the Palm IIIx wins again.  Finally. the Visor has a  protective top that is *not connected* to the body...easily lost.  On top  of everything else. Handsprings Tech Support is miserable and slow.  It  takes weeks to get a response!The Palm IIIx. with its recently lowered  price will easily beat out Handspring.  This is the best PDA on the market.,4,1,580

A35Z26M69ZK7EJ,0,The product works great but after doing a little more research I found that you can get 100 Velcro cable ties for about USD7. With these. youre basically paying for the little Belkin label that is sewn on. Just do an Amazon search for Velcro Reusable SelfGripping Cable Ties.I dont recommend this product unless you absolutely only need 5 of them and want a brand name sewn on. They did work great but just not worth it to me compared to other options on Amazon.,3,0,462

A364681EHM8FW9,0,The GPX CD Player was a great gift for Christmas for my two teen aged girls.  Its sleek style and fashionable color met their standards. all the while producing great sound.  The anti skip feature seems to be adequate.  The headphones. on the other hand. while attractive. break quite easily right above the ear contacts .within 2 weeks of xmas..  Trying to get replacements from GPX has been somewhat trying. as they want MONEY for them.  I finally bought headphones that are actually sturdier and provide better quality.,4,1,522
A365A1WPQZ7VUZ,44,I love these headphones!! I got these in Narita Airport and obsessed over them the whole airplane ride from Tokyo to Bangkok...for a very valid reason. These headphones are great. Travelling a lot. I usually have to jack up the volume to nearly full blast and then get a earache after listening for only a short while. But not with these. They cancel most of the noise in the airplane. no more droning sounds! I can now listen to music on the airplane and other noisy places using reasonable volume. I think ths product does what its supposed to do. cancels most of the noise. It never promised silence. so if thats what you are expecting from these. then dont waste your money. What it does when you turn the noisecancelling circuit on. however. is cut off most of the very low sounds. so that when youre in places with loud engines sounds .e.g. on an airplane.you wont be able to hear a lot of the grumbles. Plus. this model is an overtheear design. so even it cuts off some noise even without the noisecancelling circuit on.Some people complain about hissing sounds and I would like to clarify that. These headphones have got 2 systems. 1.normal headphones and 2. noisecancelling headphones. There are situations where you do not need the noisecancelling function and youd be better off turning the circuit system off. When you turn in on in an environment where it is not needed. you will be able to hear a hissing sound that can become annoying. Just turn it off and theyd be fine. As Ive mentioned before. these dont promise silence. .Neither do any other headphones.. When you are in a very noisy place. you will not hear the hissing instead. most of the low grumbling noise will disappear. allowing you to enjoy your music a great deal more.Also. these have got to be one of the most comfortable earphones you can ever find! If youve done the research on noisecancelling headphones .like I have.. you will find out that a lot of people complain about how a lot of noisecancelling headphones are very uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Well. good news! These are very comfortable and you can wear them for a long period of time!These headphones do exactly what theyre supposed to do. I just wish they were a tad smaller. That would have been brilliant! I mean. these take up more space than my iPod! Another downside. you wouldnt want to use these for exercising because they are pretty bulky. However. they are not meant to be for use in the gym. so I shouldnt complain.Overall. great noisecancelling. Get these and hear the difference!!!,4,1,2550

A36737J0L95CM0,4148,First off. let me say that I am soon buying a new stereo.  But not because I dont like the KaBOOM box. but because it just doesnt fit the style I want or need.  I just got a new bedroom. much larger than my old one. and it doesnt give me the surround listening experience for such a large room as I had.  With the old bedroom. it sounded awesome. but now some of the tonal qualtiy seems lost...  Alas. you cant have everything...First off. the looks of the KaBOOM box are killer. I think second only to some of those wicked looking micro systems.  That along with another feature is what drew me to the stereo.  You see. I have some bad luck when it comes to stereos.  First 3CD changer I owned broke. the tray unable to spin.  My second stereo. an RCA 5CD Changer. also broke. the laser became inoperable .?..  Unfortunately. this happened in both cases after the warranty ran out.  So I called Sears .where I got it. and chewed them out until they give me the choice of any twenty plus stereos...I chose the KaBOOM box for several reasons. a. cool looking. the original factor that piqued my interest b. kickass bass. I listen to rock and metal. but that doesnt mean I cant indulge in some serious bass c. the drum pattern. the scratch pad and the guitar and mike inputsOf course. c. was the deciding factor.  Since I play guitar. I bought it. and I now have a secondary setup in case my normal gear blows... I run a Line 6 POD through a Graphic EQ into the guitar input.  With some adjustment. and by lowering the output of the POD you can eliminate most hum and distortion. and get some great sound.  Very cool.Secondly is the sound of the CD playerradiocassette.  As stupid as it sounds. I didnt even listen to the thing before I bought it.  But it does pack a punch.  The bass is there. but without sacrificing any of the highs or mids found on a lot of my fave records .Dark Side Of The Moon. Led Zeppelin II..  Plus. if I want to kick it u0026quotold schoolu0026quot there is a special input for a turntable .very cool..  The KaBOOM box gets extremely loud without breaking up.  The volume goes to 50. but by 25. its almost unlistenably loud.  About 1214 is a nice listenable level in most cases. and you dont miss out on any of the sonic qualities. The Timer is extremely cool.  I have it set to wake me up at 7.10 every morning to u0026quotWhole Lotta Love.u0026quot  I tell. it feels like the coming apocolypse when the bass starts in and that classic riff starts.  Not a bad way to start the morning off. eh?Of course. even with its advantages. and even if I did give it five stars. there are always cons.  First. but not a real big one. is the controls.  Its set up in a fashion I find kid of odd.  The bass controls go from 0 to 6 while the mid and treble controls go from 5 to +5.  I never did figure out why that was...  Secondly is the backround hiss present if the system isnt playing anything.  If a CD finishes. the system just hisses at quite a high volume until you start a new disc or cassette.  Annoying. yes. but bearable. and I wont really lose any sleep over it.  My final complaint is actually rather stupid.  I want surround!  With the positioning of the speakers. it is very difficult to pick up on a lot of the nuances of some of the psychadelic music I listen to.  I find myself yearning to be able to point to each speaker and describe each instrument that emanates from it. but I find this impossible.  The sound all blends.  Of course. the thing is meant to be portable. and I cant really fault JVC for this because it wasnt meant for us particularly picky audiophiles.  It was. after all. meant to be a portable unit to take out and bring with you when you go out with friends or whatever.  The only problem I do have with that though is the extreme weight.  The thing almost gave me a hernia taking it downstairs.  To each their own though.Like I said. I am buying a new stereo. but I will be keeping the KaBOOM box because it is fun. simple. pleasent sounding and cool looking.  It will just be relegated to my the spot beside my normal amplifier to serve as a drum machine. onetrack recording machine. PA system for vocals. and emergency amplifier.  The life of aa stereo.  How very. very cruel...,5,1,4236

A367JNPR1HM19P,0,This is one of the strangest devices Ive used with my computer. It works sometimes. doesnt work other times. I managed to copy files off of some old floppy disks using the Sabrent USB drive. But it took a lot of experimentation.To begin with. the drive wouldnt recognize ANY of my old floppy disks when I plugged the drive into my Windows 7 laptop. and my Windows XP machine didnt fare any better. I found an old Windows 98 computer. and copied the contests of the floppies onto that machine. Then I formatted a floppy disk on Windows 98. Finally. I copied the contents of my one of my floppies .now residing on the Windows 98 machine. onto that newlyformatted disk. THAT disk could be read by the Sabrent drive! Why. I have no idea.Unfortunately. this was a oneshot proposition. Trying to erase that disk on the Sabrent made it incompatible with the Windows 98 machine... or the Sabrent drive itself. for that matter. I had to format another disk under Windows 98 to get the rest of my files transferred.When I first tried the Sabrent drive and it didnt work. I contacted the company. To their credit. Sabrent sent me a replacement drive immediately. But that drive behaved as badly as the original. and I found the above solution after a couple hours of experimentation. I recommend you stay away from the Sabrent USB drive. and buy a more functional unit.,1,0,1358

A36C2JUVN4VVTH,0,This is the second one of these that i have had to buy the smaller end that goes into the pad is extemely fragile and bends really easy and then u can not charge the touchpad so its not that i like it or think its worth it but i need it because this pad is will not charge with out it,3,0,284
A36CC9H2UVWYZH,0,Focusing impossible ! I own 2 Nikons and 2 West Marines with center wheel focusing and have no trouble.This rocker arm arrangement is problematic at best. Its either this or poor optics. Either way I will avoid these  in the future.,1,0,232
A36EBFXRTFZC8K,1,This is by far one of the best electronic purchases that I have ever made. This model is easy and fun to use. I bought this Mini Disc playerrecorder because I needed something to listen to at work. but didnt want a tape player due to the fact that one has to stop working to flip the tape all the time. I can put a lot of music and audio books on one mini disc. It is built like a tank and I can recharge the batteries without taking the batteries out. I got the recharge batteries and AC power adapter at Radio Shack. Recording from my stereo is a snap. I cant understand why Mini Disc players and mini discs arent more accepted here in the U.S.A. The advantages mini discs have over CDs are huge.,5,1,698
A36FT8KVKXXWYF,24,9 years later this dvd player has played a 1000 movies and still works like the day I bought it.  The sixth sense was a new release when I purchased this dvd player. I believe that was late 1999 or early 2000.,5,1,209
A36HG338VAK32L,0,Have owned the original Palm Pilot for ~15 years and dont want to upgrade. Needed the cradle for home use .have one at the office.. The item arrived on time and seems to work properly.,4,1,184

A36JC42MQ80UAH,0,I compared this camera with the Creative Labs Web Cam 3.  Intel Pc Camera shows a better and a superior image quality.  The software is A+ plus.  you can create videos. take photos or send cards through the internet.  Dont  forget the video conference capabilities .the package include two licences  of Intel video phone software..  But before you install this camera in your  PC. go to tech customer support site to get the correct software ID number.  .this is incorrectly labeled in the package..  A special note many friends  are reporting configuration problems with pcs equiped with ATIs video cards  or ATIs video software.,5,1,630

A36K2N527TXXJN,117,I decided to get this switch because. IMHO. you can never have enough of these devices if you have a decently wired home. Prior to this switch I had bought two Linksys switches. and they had worked fine. So far I have not noticed any less of a performance from this somewhat cheaper switch. I also use a Linksys WiFi router. and have been very satisfied with all of these products. The switch has worked flawlessly and immediately right out of the box. I daisychained this switch to another one and have not noticed any signal degradation or network slowdown. I use this switch to connect various media devices in my living room. HDTV. Bluray player and Windows Media Center PC. The video streaming on all of those devices has been of a very high quality and smoothness. The same holds for web surfing. The switch is also very compact. which comes in handy if you want to install it in a place where you already have to deal with cable and device clutter.These have been my observations thus far. If I discover anything else about this switch in the upcoming days and months. Ill update this review.,5,1,1099
A36K8K8V1K5POV,33,Im visiting this site because I accidently dropped a satellite speaker from my Altec Lansing ACS48 computer system and am considering whether to purchase new speakers.  I came across this item and felt I should comment since Ive enjoyed these speakers greatly over the year Ive owned them.  I bought the set from a seller on EBay for seventy bucks.  I dont know how long hed used them.  I listen mainly to classical music at my computer.  The satellite speakers are bright and clean with a clear treble and full midrange.  They produce the singing voice very well.  The subwoofer is weighty without being overpowering.  I didnt get an instruction booklet so it took me a few minutes to figure out how to turn the speakers on and off and how to adjust volume...PLEASE NOTE as others have that there are many different systems produced .or marketed. by Altec Lansing and some are pretty mediocre.  The ACS48 is EXCELLENT.  You cant go wrong with this speaker set.,5,1,961
A36KEY7DBNOK1K,22,What I like about these tapes is the quality of the mechanism and the tape itself is high grade. Ive had a lot of problems with tracking of almost everything TDK makes these days. I think TDK just doesnt care anymore about the limited VHS market and so are purchasing OLD high grade tape. Maxell on the other hand still is putting out good quality tape. and they are consistantly good quality with no tracking issues. However. if a vender cannot get the tapes to you in one piece due to inadequate packaging. then why bother!,2,0,525
A36KEY7DBNOK1K,22,I have had nothing but problems with TDK tapes!! Good quality picture. when the tracking isnt all screwed up!!! I used to be a big fan of TDK tapes. I always felt they were just a little bit better video quality than Maxell. but not anymore! Pretty much every single TDK tape Ive purchased over the past 2 years has had tracking problems. And its definitely not my recorders. I have several different recorders and the tracking goes out on all of them. But the Maxell tapes play just fine. time after time. Ill never buy TDK tapes again!!!,1,0,539
A36KEY7DBNOK1K,12,I like these tapes. but arrived with 1 broken tape. Broken as in shattered in transit. But I do like these tapes. I dont generally take the time to return a tapes if it arrives broken. becuase lets face it. out time is worth way more than 2 or 3 dollars for a tape. Anytime I have to go to the post office. it takes an hour of my day minimum. And the only time I have to return something is on my day off. So forget that! I haev no real choice but to eat the loss. or lose a big part of my day off!!,3,0,499
A36KQQ89928GK2,0,Just what they siad it would be and it works just fine. The color helps to see which item is pluged into which port.,4,1,116
A36KY1SWEX9ICV,0,Like the two preceding reviewers. I had much higher expectations for this product. My previous home stereo was a HarmanKardon. so when I decided to upgrade I sold my old system u0026amp got the HK 3370 stereo receiver .*****.. FL 8380 CD changer .***.. CDR 20 CD recordplay deck .havent yet thoroughly tested it out.. and this cassette deck. What a disappointment. My previous HK dual cassette deck. the DC 5300. was a solid. highquality component. .Now Im kicking myself for selling it.. But when I pulled this lightweight article out of the box and started pushing the clunky frontpanel controls. I knew Id been had. Then I put in one of my home compilation tapes .recorded on highbias tape with Dolby C on my old DC 5300.. looked at the cheesy numeric display .the DC 5300 gave tape times in minutes and seconds whereas this unit gives only numerically useless tape counters. and heard the low muffled fidelity. and my heart sank. I tried switching the Dolby to B and Off for playback. to no avail. HarmanKardons receivers are topnotch. and their products in general have a deservedly high reputation. But if theyre not going to market a better cassette deck than this one .its their only model tape deck.. they ought not bother even addressing the dwindling demand for cassette machines among audiophiles. and leave the manufacturing of cassette decks to massmarket companies like Sony or highend specialists such as Marantz. Cassettes are going the way of the 8track tape. anyways. so returning this unit to amazon.com for a refund was not a difficult decision. I think if I want to continue to listen to my cassettes Ill just buy a good Walkman. .....,1,0,1657
A36LMQHUQVIZ94,1213,Its ok. I use it on my galaxy s4 and sometimes it will unexpectedly stop detecting it. I get a message stating that the card was unexpectedly remove and then it will start loading again. Its a bit annoying when Im trying to see pictures and have to wait for them to load.,3,0,271
A36LRSU3TECMVS,0,This unit is ok. but the main problem with it is that the programing features is none but JUNK! Unless you take your universal remote and go through each code until it works. For me the only remote codes that worked was RCA and ONKYO. It is really too bad they didnt have a seperate remote. Overall if you own all RCA products in you home theater get this!!! But if you are like me and own mosty Sony you might wanna pass unless you want to get up every time to switch it.,3,0,472
A36LSCVKO9D4W9,55,I had one sent to my son in another state.

A36NKU27KU0GQN,11,I bought this case for the following reasons. 1. Does not leave the screen exposed 2. cover flips open downward and out of the way 3. looks good.Unfortunately. the magnets that hold the cover closed are .must be. quite weak. Because of this. the cover flips open many times when I brush against things. and dangles there until I notice it and close it. As a result. this case doesnt protect the screen as much as I would like it to.A final issue. yesterday. the belt clip broke. after about four months of service. Im hoping that I can find a replacement.In summary. I like this case in principle. but in actual use. it hasnt quite met my expectations.,3,0,652
A36NW00607K49I,22,Comfortable on the ears. Light on the head. Good sound qualityfor the price range. Has adapter for computer or HiFi stereo plugin. Much more cord length than cheapy mini phones.I enjoy it!,5,0,188
A36O00PBBH2II6,22,The Maxell VP100 VHS Dry Tape Head Cleaner came broken. I would not be able to use it. The manufacture of the item looks cheap. I am planning to return it. The service since you put the order and the moment that you receive it is excellent.,1,0,240
A36O8B5MLAMREO,0,The microphone is located INSIDE the tube at the tip end of the boom. It is not facing you but where ever the tip end of the boom is pointing. In order for the VOX to work properly. the boom has to be bent in a Ushape to position the tip end VERY CLOSE to your mouth. touching your lips. Im using a Motorola Talkabout MS560 with VOX sensitivity set to 3 .max.. If I dont use the VOX. the Mic can pickup whispers and the sound in the headset is clear.,4,1,450
A36OT85BNNU3TU,1,First. it is extremely slow. if it manages to rewind the tape at all.  Most of the time. it fails to completely rewind the tape. leaving at least 112 hours of tape at the beginning.  I would never purchase this brand of anything ever again.,1,0,240

A36T7WFA475ZOT,0,This is the perfect product for those of you looking for a portable  recordable audio player but are shocked at the high prices and low memory  size of MP3 players.  With the new USB to digital optical products out on  the market. it has become very easy to digitally transfer your MP3s to  minidisc at a lowcost. without having to worry about a loss of quality.  The Sharp also has a great analog sound as well.Although I have  graduated to the much higher cost Sony MD90. this was my first. and to  tell you the truth they perform almost as well.The final reason fof  purchasing this machine over an MP3 player is that for the price of 1 Sony  MagicGate 64MB Memory Card .holding an hour of music.. you can get 60  Multirecordable Minidiscs .holding close to 70 hours of music.  Need I say  more?,5,1,798
A36T7WFA475ZOT,5355,Although this MP3 player is a great product. with a lot of great features...it is only an MP3 player.  On a basic costbasisaudio  qualitycompatability scale. it would behoof you to look at a Minidsic  player rather than any MP3 player out there.  With a Minidisc  playerrecorder. you can get .for approximately the same price. a machine  with a cheaper recordable medium .A SmartMedia card costs USD80 for a 32MB  card...whereas a 74 minute Minidisc is USD2. a higher audio quality. and you  can record from not only your computer but also any digitalanalog source.  Who can beat that?,4,1,585
A36TGQDSL25O1M,78,I bought this case and have been very pleased using it daily. Its just the right size for my iPad with Smart cover and a composition notebook. Id been carrying both stacked to meetings but was worried about losing my grip. Now I can put them together in this case and it looks nice and professional. The sides are a  flexible neoprene material and give you some flexibility to carry devices of different thicknesses. The elastic band keeps the flap closed and everthing safely inside. I would say this case is ideal for carrying around and putting into a larger bag but would warn against anyone expecting this case to protect against a fall from a dramatic height. But for daily use. this case protects against dings and scratches.,5,1,732
A36TPLZUVZKKQF,33,I bought a Best Data mach II 56k Sent it back three time for all new ones. all gave crazy speaker sounds would not connect. do not buy this modem please you will be very sorry. . .,1,0,180
A36UL4V29DLJWP,22,Maybe the other reviewer got sent the wrong cable. I have the BB 9300 3G. and this cable fits in my phone perfectly.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because its shorter than my original BB data cable.  I use this as second cable to keep my BB charged at work. so its a small issue.  Just something to keep in mind. Other than that. no complaints.,4,1,347
A36VNMYPXBSTQ3,0,At first. I thought something was wrong with this. because my old one had onscreen instructions and this one doesnt. so I emailed Maxell and got a response that this one doesnt have onscreen instructions. It does work and seemed to do a great job cleaning the VCR .better than the old one actually.. Here are the instructions that Maxell emailed back to me.We have had several generations of the VP100 and the instructions have changed as well.For the current VP100 in the orange packaging the instructions are as follows.1.  Insert the Video Head Cleaner into your VCR.2.  Press the Play button and let it run for 20 seconds.  .Screen will show static or blank.3.  Stop and eject the tape now. .Mine stops automatically.4.  Replace Video Head Cleaner in its storage case to prevent contamination of the media cleaning.NOTE.  NEVER TOUCH THE CLEANING TAPE.5.  When the tape reaches the end of the cleaning roller. rewind it back to the beginning.6.  Use this cleaner after 20 hours of VCR use.,4,1,993

A36YO5S7IMA3SI,0,After being given an old Palm Pilot .with no stylus.. I purchased a set of 3 from my seller.  It arrived more quickly than I had expected. but the envelope was torn and one of the styluses was lost.

A3703H5T2Y0R0K,4,I used it for my Galaxy S4 for a good 6 months without any problems. And just today.. Its died. Wont work at all. cant recover any files. cant even format it to reuse it. It is now a worthless tiny chip... Thanks. Kingston. Wont be using this product again. Any one else who plans on using this for a phone. especially a Samsung. I would recommend you buy Samsungs brand for the SD card. I should have done that from the start. but I wasnt even aware they made an SD card brand at the time. .I should have known.. Samsung makes everything!.,1,0,540
A370861PA473YB,11,I am very satisfied with the mic. except for one thing and I dont think it matters that much but the length of the cord is a little limited. It serves its purpose on my vest rig.,4,1,178
A370ZV6ZR2Y7UO,0,I had a pair of Discwasher Headphones for a while which put out some serious bass and had an inline volume control. These Jenson phones are from the same company as the Discwashers I had. The 40mm driver in these  Jensons are 5mm bigger than my old discwashers. I just sold the Discwashers  to a friend bc he never heard such awesome sound on headphones before.  These Jensons are better!  I am so happy. They are at a DANG GOOD price.  sound awesome. and have a great volumemute control. I dont believe many  heaphones can compare to this one especially for the price.,5,1,569
A371KJIZOECARJ,1515,This is a nice TV wall mount that works as it describes. For the price that I paid USD25. it cant be beat.  Compared to department stores like .Walmart. Target. Costco.. they are charging USD7080 for something similar to this product.  This was use to mount a 32inch Samsung LCD TV. It feels sturdy and works good. I only give it a 4 stars because the instructions that came with the mount isnt very clear.  I highly recommend this product.  If youre unsure. rest assured that this product does what it says its supposed to do.,4,1,527
A371YSCKIX4Y4D,0,They are very good for recording. I love them. I will definitely be ordering more. Keep up the good work.,4,1,105
A371ZZ95ZQEIZV,0,I received the mount. which was well packaged for shipping.  The installation instructions were Moderately clear.  No issues following them. they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on.My shipment had a miscut piece. and was missing 4 screws.  I contacted the Manufacturer. and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day .Shipped out of Texas. so normal mailing times applied.I like how the Mount fits together. and I easily mounted my 60lbs TV by myself.  The part that attaches to the TV has a hook that will hold the TV on the Arm till you bolt it on.Its very adjustable. and pushes almost flush with the wall.Im very happy. but took one star for the miscut piece.,4,1,732
A373J57DEO4M7W,0,I love using this cable with a laptop and a street atlas program to know exactly where I am and how far it is to the next turn.  But be careful with the cable when not connected to the GPS.  I bent a pin while pulling it out of my backpack and it eventually broke off.  I had to buy a new one.  Im now making a cover to protect the pins during storage.,4,1,352

A374BGVQOPGT6G,33,The NOOK ebook reader compares favourably with the KINDLE. as well as being cheaper.  Once you have mastered the idiosyncratic technique for converting books to EPUB format and loading them onto the NOOK  I suggest getting a copy of CALIBRE which will streamline the conversion process.  The NOOK is lighter and more convenient to carry around than the KINDLE  my wife crocheted a nice neat carry bag for mine.  I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques .maybe I should read the instructions. but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.  TO sum up  I am very satisfied.Kiap2012,4,1,635
A374BQKAT0IC8B,11,After about a year of service. the link between my machine and the computer stopped working.  I attempted to get te problem fixed by calling u0026quotcustomer serviceu0026quot and was put on hold for a ridiculous length of time.  Then I was told to download a useless interface.  The end result is that I am going to get a new MP3 player that isnt made by this manufacturer.,1,0,374
A374T2A72YX9RR,34,I ordered overnight. and receive my Rio 500 the next day. If your thinking about one. its awesome. Heres my feedback. Dont bother using the software on the CD that comes with in the box. It works. but the latest  version on the rioport website is much better. There is no software for  anything other than Windows 98 or Mac right now. It will not load on  Windows 2000 becasue of that. and will not work on Windows 95 do to lack of  USB support in Windows 95. The earbuds fall out of my ears easy. but this  is not a Rio problem. Im sure there are better listening devices to make  this product sound even better. I had no problem installing it or figuring  out how to work it. but I work with computers for a living. It was pretty  straight forward for me on Windows 98. Be sure to have your Rio connected  when installing the software. and register the software after its  installed to get the full functionality. The easiest way to do all this is  to be connected to the Internet when installing this product. Once your up  and running. I highly recommend News Rover to get MPG files from the net.  Hope this helps.,5,1,1118
A3756G8ZZOFWAL,2525,The company that sold this to me .A Days Tech. claimed that this was a genuine Samsung product on the Amazon listing.  It simply was NOT the device that was being shown in the image. but a really crappy knock off that worked maybe half the time with my TVs.  To further complicate things. after contacting the company .A Days Tech.. they said they would send me a return envelope .someone also said they had  already sent it . so I could get a refund.  Well. that never happened.  Then someone duped me .and I fell for it. by asking me to remove my negative feedback and they would send an RMA kit. and refund my money.  I questioned those tactics. but I did it anyway. so that didnt happen either.  Overall. the Amazon reseller .A Days Tech. in my opinion was dishonest about the product listing. the product itself was garbage. and dealing with them via email made them sound more and more shady.  To boot. their page on Amazon seems to incessantly point the finger at Amazon in their feedback section.It seems to me that this Samsung  OEM  HDMI device is not what it appears to be.  I dont know if its Amazon that is shipping this item. other Amazon retailers. or A Days Tech directly. but either way. for me it was NOT what was shown in the images.  A picture is worth a thousand words. and if the picture says Samsung. and the listing text says  OEM  your natural assumption is that it will say  Samsung  on it when you receive it.  That was not the case for my situation.I will end with this.  Buyer be warned.,1,0,1516
A37574FXQ9AAFY,11,Install was easy. just as instructions said.  We have a 42  on it and it works just fine and is level in the current position.  My only negative comment is the single  swing arm  is not that sturdy. so when theTV is moved. it is no longer level because the single arm doesnt appear to be strong enough to hold the weight in the new position.  Overall a minor comment. as the cost for the unit is very reasonable.  I would recommend it to others.,4,1,445
A376EGQERLPH3O,0,I ordered a Back Office after reading the customer reviews and looking at other laptop backpacks in the chain computer and electronics stores.First. the quality of the store merchandise was no where near as high as  that of the back office and was priced higher.  I also found other  comparable backpacks for substantially more on the web.Also. as a  commuting student. I must take everything I will need for the entire day  with me in the morning.  The restrictions of what I bring come from how  much weight I am willing to carry. not from what the bag will hold.  I am  yet to fill the bag completely which makes it very versatile.  I agree with  other comments that this bag would be great for travel.Finally. I  spent the first week of the quarter using my conventional laptop briefcase  and even without any added weight from books. the uneven weight  distribution was killing my back and shoulder.  Once I received my Back  Office. I havent had any trouble and have begun carrying books and files  in additional to my laptop.  Still no soreness. tiredness. aches or  pains.The only negatives are that the photos on the website dont do the  product justice and it truly isnt a bag for someone that is seeking a  conventionally sized backpack.  If you need a larger bag that is sturdy.  wellconstructed. high quality and highly functional  this is the bag for  you!,5,1,1370
A376XP5D93XQGP,3535,This small peace of equipment has made life much easier for me in the past months. While in meetings. I can take notes. with the grafitti option. I can immediately add tasks to my to do list. while still in the meeting.This  small friend reminds me to call home. writea letter or to make a phone  call. while busy working. I write letters.compose email when the issue  comes up. and send them in the evening. appointments my secretary makes in  my desktop computer are automatically transfered in a matter of seconds. to  my palm V and vice versa. so that we have the same appointment information.  I can go on for some time. but in short Ill say. this is an improvement of  working life. I have never experienced before. and it is beautiful too. I  have a few wishes though. maybe the screen could have another type of  lighting in the future and maybe the company could add sketching options.  it would be nice to see the grafitti letters forming. like in some other  palm computers I have seen. you have five stars and four stars. I would  like to give it four and a half. when the improvements I mentionde will be  implemented. it will be a five star for me! other palms I have seen I rated  only three. because they are bulky and the display is not as simple as that  of the palmV and the problem with the batteries is for always over with  your palm V,4,1,1357
A3792AGFNXO3D7,7582,this box has svideo inputs wich really made the difference when i decided to buy it. you get a much better picture with svideo than regular rca cables.  i have a dvd player and a satellite system along with a playstation 2 and i wanted to make sure they were all able to deliver quality pictures to my tv.  the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was the learning remote part of the system. it didnt learn any of my remote codes. it didnt come with a remote and i had to manually change from input to input. peace,4,1,513
A379OA0EQEQRR7,78,As a camcorder it lives up to all the expectations of an average buyer. But I found it really excel when I connected it to my Sony VAIO computer through the iLink .IEEE1394  FireWire. port. With the DVGate Motion  software supplied with the computer. capturing digital video with precision  becomes child play. I can edit these videos with Adobe Premiere LE and  upload the video back to the camcorder and transfer it to VHS tape through  a VCR. What makes this process incredibly easy is the controlling  capability built into the camcorder. You connect it to the PC and forget  it. You can then Rewind. Cue. mark In and Out points and initiate a perfect  video capture all from the computer with just mouse clicks! I was  transformed from a video novice to an expert in just a week!

A379Y8ICDJ7DAC,11,I was very excited to buy this product after seeing all the great features it had.  I heard that some people could not get it to work. so I was skeptical however based on what the box said. my video card .Nvidia Riva TNT2. was compatible.After I installed the drivers to my Windows 98 SE 900Mhz computer. Windows failed to boot.  I called tech support .no toll free number. had to pay long distance fees. and they had no idea how to repair their crapfordrivers.  I was very disapointed and had to return the card.  Very. very bad choice.,1,0,537
A37ALZ4LXO082G,0,it was working perfectly at first but after using it for about half an hour it broke and never worked again,1,0,107
A37AO7DNHVKB28,0,Havent had it but a few weeks. but I am learning how to download from the library. etc.  love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.  No operating problems so far.  Would recommend it for home or away ,5,1,243

A37AZ3IM0ICUCM,0,I purchased the above mentioned radio last November. and was more than pleased with its sound and the ability to bring in many stations. In the last week the radio doesnt bring in stations and hold them whether on AM  or FM.  I am now very disappointed that Amazon.com told me the warranty is  no longer in force.  I am stuck with a radio which I liked very much and is  now useless to me.  I dont know how many people save the original boxes  this long. but I am not one of them. Even under these conditions. I will  continue to be a good customer of Amazon.com.,1,0,563
A37BOX4N3HXTS,713,My Canon was purchased through the Marlboro campaign last year.....and I Love It.  I have taken pictures at sunset .my favorite time of day.. with incredible results .400800 film. and I have taken pictures in the  rain .not a downpour or underwater. and with the same clarity and detail as  on a sunny day.  I am also very pleased with the shape and weight of  the Canon. I would recommend it without hesitation.,5,1,412
A37BSWQU375E1I,3235,First. I have BOTH a Viper 770 card at USD250 and a Voodoo3 2000 PCI card at USD129. Plugging each card into the same P400 system I cant tell the difference running in nonGlide mode. They are both the fastest gaming  cards available on the market for both 2D and 3D. The visual quality of  both cards is excellent.  However. everything that runs in Glide runs and  looks much better so I chose the Voodoo3 as my main card and use the V770  at work. At this time I would have to recommend buying the Voodoo3 2000 for  USD129 over the Viper 770 at USD250. Save the  money for the next generation of  cards that is coming six months down the road.,5,1,644
A37DO1NOTWOLEG,35,If you use a gender reverser  you can plug your palm into your modem. I used it with a ricochet modem and it worked great. Of course. you will have to have the correct palm VII files on your III or V to run PQA. but many online palm apps are not PAQs and run just fine.,5,1,269
A37EQK9SXA8M4N,12,I bought this product based on the other reviews.  It seems to work initially. but Ive had to use it multiple times to get the desired result.  After about the 3rd use. Ive stopped getting the snow effect on my screen. So I guess it really worked.It lasts a long time. and I know how to refill and reuse it. Im definitely glad I made the purchase and will be able to use it as long as I have and continue to use a VCR.,4,1,418
A37F7SWDM6RD6Y,0,Ok the thing is is that they really do fit well. BUT! The sound is reversed. the instromentals .spelling?. are put louder and the vocals are bearly there. and i know that the tape was working so... dont get it  though its not very good at all.,2,0,243
A37F8W82A1E6L7,23,If you are unsure that you will use a digital camera and just want to see what all the fuss is about. this is the camera for you.  Wifey and I had been kicking around the idea of getting a digital camera for a while. but  the pile of u0026quottoys we dont play with anymoreu0026quot was too large to  warrant buying something expensive on a lark.  We shopped around and found  the Polaroid didnt have all the bells and whistles that wed read about in  all the gizmo magazines. but it didnt carry that price either.  I dont  think that two days has gone by without us using it in some way. If you run  on line auctions or post pictures to a web site this little guy will do  everything you need.  Need something to email pictures to grandma?  You  can even hook it up to a TV with the included cables and run a slideshow  for the family.  The software it comes with is fairly easy to use and setup  was a breeze.  The serial connection is quite a bit slower than USB. but  for the price there are really no complaints. Like I said before. if you  want to try out digital photography and see of its a fit for you pick up  this camera.  Try it for a year until the mega pixel guys come down in  price.  You wont be disappointed.,4,1,1225

A37GFV0AL784BL,0,I picked up my modem and installed it in just a couple of minutes. It was easy. When I log on. it seems to connect at 49333 every time. I guess that is good because my 33.6 connected at 31.9. I was going to buy that USD25 one with the USD20. rebate but from the reviews  you get what you pay for. I  went with Diamond and I am glad I did. The box says the requirements are  for a pentium 133 or higher. I have a Pentium 120 and it has worked great.,5,1,448

A37MH60SMOU92W,0,I have purchased a number of digital cameras over the last 2 years. including one from AGFA. the ePhoto 307 .A great little camera..  The ePhoto Smile is an Affront to the AGFA brand name. The pictures are awful. the battery life abysmal. and worst of all. it would be a bad deal at 12  the price.  I recently bought my youngest daughter a Polaroid Digital 320.  It takes much better pictures. and were still  working on the 1st set of batteries . . . .. In short. dont buy this  camera.  If you really want to take digital pictures its hard to go wrong  with the Olympus 340R for under USD300.,1,0,594

A37ON5R71AV3HD,0,Works great. The printing is very visible and sticks well without leaving a messy residue. Id rate it 5 except.1. There is excessive lead before and after the printed space and excessive top and bottom space even when printing with the largest letters .this may be the fault of the Brother printer rather than the tape..2. If you switch tape cartridges for different colors. you have to watch out for getting the tape outside of its tape cartridge guide tabs. After the open area where the printing happens. the tape goes under two guide tabs. It is easy to carelessly pull the cartridge out of the printer so that the print head pulls the tape out from the tabs. If you try and use the cartridge with the tape outside of the guide tabs the tape will jam up in the printer.My spouse and I have tried a couple of different labelers like the Brother but found them not as satisfying. This tape and the printer it goes with are a very nice products.,4,1,946
A37P2509UG03IP,2324,Read all of the instructions. which were not very clear.Tried all that it was instructed and let the computer even try for me.I never got to use it and now it just sits in the closet.

A37PJTNYQZ732C,12,I wear a hearing aid and  I am very hard of hearing.  I cannot wear any headphones with the puffy circle of stuff around them because that makes my hearing aid squeal  so I try to find some that are flat and most of them just dont add to the volume.  I need one that I can afford with volume control so the sound will be even louder.  The headphone I would rate as  good  for those who have decent hearing.  For me. the problem is just my hearing and I cant do anything about that.  The price was good. I just have  some  hearing in one ear.  I just gave a two star rating because of my situation  other wise someone else might be very happy with them.  Thanks.,2,0,661
A37PRMG44FWOMT,0,I loved this tablet when I first got it. It has a big interface. beautiful image coloring when watching videos. and a nice amount of sound. However. this tablet overheats WAY too quickly. And when it starts to overheat there a faint dark line going across the middle of the tablet when holding it portrait sized. When it gets even hotter there are colored lines going all across the tablet! Also. the carousel on the homepage is extremely ugly and isnt wellproportioned when in landscape mode. My battery dies pretty quickly. but I guess its because I play games literally all day and watch videos. Otherwise Id have about 7 hours of battery on my hands. And lastly. to top it all off. theres no protective cases for this product. Sure. there are flip cases .Which are terribly made. but thats another story... but Id like something that protects my whole tablet. preferably an otterbox.,3,0,887
A37QD96UEZPYMI,34,Within one week the machine failed to work using the exchange function. It is currently at a JVC authorized repair shop.

A37RCV5QQ40SYX,11,My Cardinal 33.6 would only connect to my ISP at 24 to 26.  This Diamond installs quick and simple and now I connect at 41333.  A great price for a huge boost to my PCc performance.  Thanks for a GREAT deal Amazon !,5,1,215
A37SZMDIA9D0B2,12,This nook color was a gift for my wife she loves to read magazines. We both own the first gen nook and I use mine mostly for technical reading and as a field manual for engineering documents. I have close to 30 books  manuals on my current nook.As a current nook owner I had no hesitation when buying the color version. I expected an easy. friendly interface with a somewhat underpowered device. after all it is an eReader. not a tablet PC. The UI is very user friendly and I am quite surprised of the power of the nook color. The touch screen is way more responsive than I expected. page turning and scrolling is very smooth. The network setup was very easy and syncing my wifes Google contacts was a breeze. What is really nice is that you can view content in either portrait or landscape mode.great for magazines..The 2 childrens books Bu0026N included can either be read or the nook will read them to you. Nice feature..Current issues that need attention.An issue that we ran into was with the nook color gallery feature. I loaded 70 very large .7+ MB. .jpg files in the My Pictures directory and noticed the scrolling became very slow. So to hopefully remedy that. I batch converted the files to 50% and now the scrolling is back to normal. I dont know if this issue can be addressed by Bu0026N or if this is just a hardware limitation. Either way. the feature is very nice.Another issue was the lack of Flash support within the browser.YouTube videos look like poop!I am hoping Bu0026N will address these issues with the next update. which I hear is due in January 2011.I think you will find as usual. many of the people giving poor ratings dont even own the device. but instead picked up a demo in the store and played with it for 5 minutes or they are complaining that Bu0026Ns tech support did not resolve their issue in the first 5 minutes. As of today. the nook color software is at the release version 1.01. Patient people will be rewarded with a great experience. I cant wait to see how they are going to expend this device.Good job Bu0026N and Happy Reading!!!!,5,1,2075

A37W0DMJWGGWV7,19,I dont own one of these .yet.. but I have used it for fairly intense work. Setup was a snap on my IBM Thinkpad T20. I was able to hook up an analog camcorder and capture video. without any syncing problems.  The quality is pretty good. I had no problems with how it looked fullscreen .1024x768. when I captured at 640x480 .which the card doesnt actually do. it just doubled the 320x240 resolution of the video tape.. The editing software is pretty horrible however. I used Adobe Premiere and it worked great.,4,1,508
A37WWMRMNR2KSA,44,This product is crap. I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail .I am a very methodical person. and it didnt remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more. I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions. but I am not willing to do that the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work. Following the instructions. it ruins your CD or DVD even further. Dont wast you time. money and your CD  DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it.,1,0,519
A37X7HCD3N26VA,2,The Sharp MS 722 is the best portable audio produc for the price on the market today. Period. I am very familiar with portable audio product so I know what Im talking about. Ive owned a Rio PMP 300 MP3 player. a Nomad 64 MB MP3 player. a Sony RZ70 minidisk recorder. Ive sold them all for about what I paid for them. The Rio. having only 32 MB was worthless. I could only fit 8 songs at CD quality! The Nomad was better. with 64 MB. but after I went on vacation to Tennessee. I think Ill scream if I hear one of the 18 songs I had on it again. The Sony had the advantage of minidisk storage. but the sound quality was really lacking with its ear bud headphones. no Bass to it. After doing a lot of research I decided to go with the Sharp MS 722. I am very impressed. The controls are very easy to use and the sound quality is beyond description with words. Most portable audio players sound bad when you hook the up to anything but headphones. The Sharp will blast through my Alpine car stereo at full blast with amazing quality. the unit looks really cool. Ive gotten a lot of compliments on it.Pros. Best sound qualit...easy to use controls Very customizable. turn antiskip and button beep onoff Very durable. im convinced its indestructable Looks coolCons. Doesnt include cable to hook up to most sound cards and Portable CD player Doesnt come with any minidisks .I was a little disapointed when the package arrived.All in all. Like Ive said. I know what Im talking about and you are not going to find a better minidisk player.,5,1,1530

A37XKOBKEWX35E,45,I loved my Axim X30 high. Didnt know how Id ever lived without one. Read books. watched movies. checked my email on the go ... wonderful! However. after owning it for a year and six months .thus out of warranty.. I turned it on one morning to be greeting by a solid. white screen. Hard and soft reset had no effect. Switching batteries didnt help.Then I discovered that Dell charges you USD39 just to TALK to someone who can initiate the repair process on an outofwarranty item. Theres no place to take it or send it in. You have to go through the phone number that charges you up front before you can even talk to someone about repairs. That just doesnt seem right to me. and Im disappointed at how soon my Axim .which was very well cared for and never dropped or roughly handled. stopped working. Complaints to customer service just get me canned responses.,2,0,859

A384P5XYDRGBCF,6470,I am new to nook color and bought over 40 books on the day I purchased the device. naively thinking that all Publishers adhered to the text size options available within nook .the 6 letter A images incrementing from very small to the largest.. Much to my dismay when I later had time to go through all of the books Id purchased and play with text sizing and font options. I found that this was not the case. Indeed. the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairments.My plea to Barnes u0026 Noble. Publishers. Amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs. In the US alone. there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged. made bold. underlined. etc. My feeling is that corrected versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacements.Personally. I have visually impaired people in my family and I will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizes.Nook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses. so for now I rate it 3 stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented. I know I speak for many. and thank you for your time and consideration.,3,0,1419
A384UZZIZDHSNJ,1113,As someone who worked for the GE Audio division back when the first Superadio was developed. I can attest to the fact that the product was seriously designed as a very high quality piece.  The engineers had their GE radio reputations on the line. and the concept of good mono vs. bad stereo obviously had market appeal.Over the years. inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made .I was part of some of these types of discussions as well.. but when I was looking for a good portable radio. this version was high on the list.  We have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound.  One problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out. but thats why we have Amazon. right?,4,1,797

A38D0HJVOFMQ7,0,This was the dvd player of its time.  To love this player means you cant compare it to anything of todays standards.  Ive purchased this player when the price was over 300 and dvd was just making a hit and now. after more then 5 years .lost count. i still love it.  I must say that during those 5 years or so. it did everything that i wanted it to do.  I watch a lot of movies and have monthly membership and so my movie viewing is over 500 movies i think.  Anyway. it plays fine and the zoom feature is realy great.  It resembles the EZ view that a lot of dvd players now have.  The only thing that i remember about this player is that it didnt have a lot of formats that it can play.  For movies all you are stuck with are dvds.  NO VCD. no dvdr nor dvd+r.  All it does is play dvds and the cd sound is moderate.  Ive never used the HDcd option so i cant say for sure.This year. Im starting to notice that it is starting to show its wear but that is ok because it has exceeded my expectations already.  I would say that it gives error messages 1 out of every 10 movies that I load up and it seems to get worst each month.  The dual tray isnt used anymore because it has too many moving parts.  Most new players gives you 1 or 5 trays but nothing in between.  Even I knew from the start that the trays were problematic since it sometimes doenst switch to other dvds but i never knew if that was the player or the dvd itself.This year. it has been pushed back from the living room to just a sleeping room due to other players with better format and options.  Still. its a good player but i think you will find multiple formats of dvdr and dvd+r better in the newer players for a few more bucks.  It will be better for the far future.,4,1,1733

A38D9RSMAYZSCM,0,I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past.  The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with  a slot in the top. so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped.  These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie.  You have to wrap it carefully .and not particularly tightly. around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks.  If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off.  These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described.  One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you arent going to be undoing them regularly.  True. but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost.,2,0,803
A38DGYI77KWVUD,23,I got these speakers at a more expensive price. These speakers are very high in quality. I think theyre worth more than what you pay for.,5,0,137

A38HCBJDXTSWKK,11,While I have never really found huge differences in hubs based on the name brand. I have generally been very happy with this Netgear Hub and my new Netgear Router.  It is built very solid .which is not true of all hubs. and seems to stand up well to some heavy use.  .Ill sometimes have to take it into work and I move it around frequently when I rearrange my office...so it gets more `mileage than most hubs!.The one weakness Ive found with Netgear is the Tech Support.  Their web site is not the most userfriendly site and it can be a bit of an effort to find a driver or anything.  But it is all there and you can get PDF copies of the manuals and such. so that is helpful.  The one time Ive had to contact Netgear phone support .related to a wireless network card. it was not impressive at all.  But for this hub. you should have no need for Tech Support and it is an excellent hub.,4,1,886
A38HDTFYZMNGCN,0,I thought that when I plugged them in that it was going to be all flimsy due to the short wires. But. the low bass and sound output deafened my Siamese cat .... Now I can rock the dorm with this hunk of wood. A whole lot of Uuummphhh for the .price. ...   A must buy.,5,1,267
A38HKAQXYFADS6,23,I wanted to go green when it came to reading books.  This is fantastic.  I did want a tablet that was wireless and in color.  My sister has the IPAD and its FANTASTIC for every age. i was hoping for something similar but you get what you pay for.  The nook is awesome but if you want 4g. not going to work. if you want more apps. this isnt it.If you want to just be able to read SOME books. this will work. i had a list of books i wanted to buy and just assumed they would be available on the nook and their not. so that was a bummer. I did buy the kindle first and hated it next to the nook. this is def nicer looking being in color and the kidle has sponsor ads all the time which is really annoying.  The nook does have some cool kids books where it reads to them so its been nice to keep my 3 year old busy.  its for the most part user friendly but i def need to go through the tour because sometimes it takes me back to the book i was reading when im just trying to get to another book.  its nice that i can check my email but it is a bummer to not be able to use it wherever im at.  My sis gets pedicures and uses her Ipad to watch shows. read her emails or whatever.. the nook will be great just to read your downloaded books as getting wifi is not always available.,4,1,1273
A38I8GLI1IWIFZ,0,We purchased a pair of these speakers. and within a month. one stopped working. By the fifth month. the other one died.  We took them back and exchanged them. Amazingly. about a month after getting the new speakers. one stopped working. On the bright side. we did get seven months out of the second speaker before a pop and fizzle signaled its quick demise. Sadly. we were past our warranty and RCA has informed us theres nothing they can do. I guess thats only fair. but the poor quality and practically nonexistant duration of this product made it quite a large waste of money.,1,0,579

A38JT4UWUX8F5H,44,I own a new Nook tablet and an early generation Kindle. My Kindle will always remember where I left off in a book. but my new Nook doesnt. Every time I reopen a book in my Nook it takes me back to page one. This is extremely frustrating. Ive tried the manual and online forums. but nothing helps. I see countless others having the same problem. Whats up Barnes N Noble? As an eReader. the Nook stinks. For playing games and limping through the Web. it does okay. The salesmen at Staples misled us about the Nook being a great eReader. I will definitely purchase a newer Kindle next time around. I hope I can sell this Nook. and I will be truthful with whoever buys it. Hope I can find someone who wants an eReader for purposes other than reading.,1,0,746

A38L1T3NQ9NMDV,0,I agree with the earlier reviewer that this is a waste of money. The zip drive with a 100M capacity isnt very useful for backing up MP3 or other large files. I can save 510 MP3 songs on each floppy. A CD writer is a better investment.,2,0,234
A38L4SQLHL47K2,712,Although this generic charger popped up on the Amazon website as compatible with my Garmin Nuvi 1490T. it isnt.  I charged the device for 6 hours and tried to add a map.

A38OX42SVSLWM2,0,I had WP1 and A1 before. Both of them looked almost the same except the colour of the rubber grip for the hand is different. the macro logo of the mode dial is different. WP1 is a weatherproof camera. not waterproof. It is excellent for snorkelling and rugged use. WP1 started to leak at 6m or 20ft when I used for SCUBA diving. that was my mistake. So I bought an A1. so far tested to 35m .though only guaranteed to a few metres. and still going strong. same for another 2 A1s that my friends have. Both WP1 and A1 are excellent cameras. gave excellent pictures. The price difference .almost 100%. basically gives you the peace of mind in terms of watertightness. One thing to take note. the flash is not strong enough so underwater pictures will turn out to be greenish or bluish. and fine particles will tend to disperse the flash and over expose the pictures. Have fun!,3,0,873
A38PNSF32UJGVO,2021,I rolor blade and jog a good ways and the no moving parts feature is perfect. Exclient continues music with no skip works for me.I down load my  favorit cds and they come out great.The only bad part is only six songs.  almost seven.You defnitly need a sondvido card.Unfortunly there  expensive.but nessary if you want longer play time.Im going wait till they  drop in price or hopefully go on sale.,4,1,398
A38Q1UX64HWEET,11,All 4 of us in our family have a nook color and we are generally happy with it. We rooted them to turn them into a great little tablet before the tablet came out.My only complaint is the charging cable. The metal connector is VERY flimsy and easily bent. Dont read with it plugged in and be careful how you have the device sitting while charging. One bump can break it and they wont replace it unless its under warranty despite everyone complaining it is badly designed.Dont expect much help in the stores. either. They have poor trained employees who are overwhelmed.,3,0,568

A38QYFER0PF4HO,0,I am currently in Bosnia. as part of a peacekeeping mission here in the Balkans.  I purchased two Talkabouts to play around with while here. and was so impressed with their performance that my unit has purchased several  more.  We currently use them in the majority of our missions. as we have  found that. with a two mile PLUS range. these radios are ten times more  practical than the militarybought bulky radios. which. in average. are not  as dependable as the Talkabout.  We have enough to carry around with us.  and know a convenient product when we see it.  A great buy.,5,1,577
A38SHOPZADNOLN,3234,For the price. you cant beat this sturdy radio.  Great sound. and durable.  Use it in the garage and around the deck and its got great volumn and clarity.  You cant beat the deal that GE is providing.  Second model owned. had their original model for 13 yrs and was so impressed I got a new one.,5,1,295

A38T55CCT4B3E6,11,Although it says that the camera is not Windows certified when it is being stalled. I have no problem whatsoever. I got the latest driver from vividcommunications.com.I have no idea why some people report lowlight problem or color problems but this camera is the best that Ive used in term of clarity and lowlight capability.  I think once you figure out how to set this camera up. youd enjoy this camera.With interchangable lenses. the camera can cover a wide range of angles.As for mounting. I went to Best Buy and got a pair of speaker wall mounts for about USDUSD. which provides all the adjustment angles youd need.  You only need one mount for each camera but have to buy them in pairs. as they are made for speakers.Good luck to those who are getting a webcam.  If you need more info on the mount. just contact me.,5,1,821

A38U1P0DD470O7,0,I keep these in my computer bag for those days .12week. that I am not in my primary office. where I have a decent pair of phones. First and foremost. they are extremely portable. The case is probably 34 inches in diameter. so theyll take up little space. The sound is decent. After 68 hours wearing them. though. and insertingremoving numerous times when moving about. the comfort level drops precipitously. Also. the cord is pretty short. so even pushing away from the desk can put you at the end of your tether.  Still. for .X. or less. they are not much of an investment. I am searching reviews now for some phones that are going to be more comfortable. I cant imagine Ill find anything more portable.So. for infrequent use. these are fine. For more regular or prolonged use while on the road. Im going to spend more and hopefully get something more comfortable.,3,0,865
A38UKFBS0Y3KZY,23,I got this JVC video tape player a long time ago and guess I paid about USD100 for it back then. Its the only VCR we have now that still works and dont eat up VHS tapes. I got it because of the SVideo and I can play are old VHS tapes with SVideo to a DVD recorder SVideo input to save are old VHS tapes to DVD. With the way are other VCRs are not working and messing up VHS tapes it is very good to get them saved to DVD and this is about the best way using SVideo.Raymond Day,5,1,476
A38UW76RNLHUOP,23,Just a quick comment as most of what you read hear correctly talks about the Palm V as a fantastic tool.  There is no reason to keep the Franklin Covey Planner Software .unless you are really attached to it.. especially  if you have the Microsoft office suite. The ability to u0026quothot  synchu0026quot the appointments. addresses. to do lists. and memo pads on the  Palm V and a PC gives you amazing flexibility. I have the cradle attached  to my PC at work and use a travel kit to synch up my work laptop and my  home desktop .yep. I do have to many computers.. So I enter the data into  my Palm V once and then hot synch each of the computers as necessary.  You  also can u0026quotbeamu0026quot any of the information from one Palm to another  Palm. Forget business cards. first see if the person has a Palm and you can  beam it to them. You can beam addresses. meetings. you name it. There are  numerous types of software that you can add to your Palm. Some is  shareware. some you purchase. I have a scientific calculator software on  mine .it comes with a basic calculator already loaded. so that I dont have  to carry a calculator in addition to the Palm V.  Basically. this tool can  do the job. I highly recommend it to the business person .small or large  business.. the student. the parent. or anyone.,5,1,1314
A38W0LAVL4Q55Z,6264,What a great idea!  No batteries.  Rechargeable. Slim design. Easy to bend to the perfect reading position. Too bad its a USD20. piece of junk.  Turned on and wouldnt go off.

A38YIGMVSCKE16,12,Ive had this pair for about 2 months now. and I really like them. The sound is actually really nice. and crips with nice bass. These headphones are comfortable for like about an hour or so. but wearing them for a long time will make your ears heart A LOT. There is also another flaw. IF you have a small head. these headphones make you look like idiot because they are exceptionally big. and look weird. kind of like some alien communication device.Overall though there is nothing extremely bad about these headphones and they will suit mostly everyone who buys them. and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking good sound.,4,1,625
A38YRFLSDE35WC,0,Great film.  I just watched with my family and theAmazon steaming version is original CinemaScope Not pan and scan as the DVD version was.  Rent it that way.,4,1,157

A391VPL5TV92XP,0,My Sony ICFS79V is still going strong after a year of showers in my home. It gets used about 3 or 4 times a day and hasnt missed a beat yet. I use the rope provided with the radio to hang it from the tap in the shower. I like the large raised buttons on the top of the radio which make them easy to see and feel in a hot steamy shower cubicle. I have already recommended this radio to my friends and family.,5,1,407
A39239F78V03U4,44,I work in Cable Modem operations. We have some  customers who buy cheap. and often problematic NICs. ony to face hours of endless troubleshooting on NIC issues. The NetGear FA310 is one of their biggest problems. Made of  flimsy greenboard and u0026quot? u0026quot type Chinese components. NetGears  crusade of inexpensive NICs has made a joke of consistentcy. The price may  be attractive. yet you would be hardpressed to find any company who would  commit to using NetGear NICs throughout their operation. Simply because  the service and quality is inconsistent. NetGears customer support is  short of laughable. as well.You get what you pay for. From my point of  view. I would avoid NetGear. Linksys. or any other u0026quotOffBrandu0026quot  NIC and consider looking for one more dependable. You may pay a little more  for a 3Com. Intel. and SMC. but they are worth the price. They offer the  consistency and stability every NIC user should demand  Not just a  discount price.,2,0,980
A392YS0W837HFU,1123,A wonderful camera for Intrnet use. For auctions. emails. web sites. Etc. this is a fine camera. The advantages are great macros .down to 1u0026quot..10X zoom lens. comes with rechagable battery and charger. simple downloading of floppies to your PC and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium.  However this is NOT a camera suitable for Photos .Because of the 640X480 resolution. Do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos. For fine photos go to a 1 or 2 megapixel cameras. I also own the Nikon Coolpix 950 camera and recommend any Nikon or Olympus camera. Only the Nikons have great Macro capability .If this is important. A great buy for the money is the Olympus 460490.,4,1,729

A3945ISJV9TI1P,0,Without question....buy the camera.  Do what I did and check the reviews.  Amazons is slightly off mark. Most rank the D340R at the top of the u0026quotUnder USD300.00u0026quot class.  1280X960 TRUE megapixel resolution is hard to beat at USD250.00 .what I paid. and the quality is just what others  have said....1st rate!Unlike Amazons review. it IS a battery miser.  second only to the HP C30 .1000 photos..  The full motion LCD screen is the  only credible drain and not using it will give you well over 700 shots on a  set of AAs.My camera came with an 8mb card.  Amazon is incorrect in  stating 8megs give you only 60 standard quality photos.  Its 122 640x480  pictures.  If you plan on doing a lot of picture posting or emailing.  640x480 size pictures dont overwhelm the servers out there.  You get 36 HQ  pictures .1280x960....4x the file size of a standard quality pic.  18 SHQ  pictures .1280x960 but with superb crispness and detail. fit on the card.  What am I saying?  You wont need to buy a spare card if you can hook up to  the computer every few days or weekly at the most.  Ill buy a couple extra  cards for any long road trip!A final comment on downloading.  Serial  cable connections are inherently slower than USB hookups.  However. the  Olympus D340Rs download time through its serial connection is remarkably  fast...a lot faster than HPs and Fujis....about 57 secs per 640x480 pic.I hope this helps.  This camera truly is fantastic and Ive become both  a website buff and amateur photographer as a result.  Happy New Year!,5,1,1545
A3946L5N554V7C,7575,I bought the 2012 Nook and had constant problems with the device going dark.  Took it back to Bu0026N many times and finally in 2013. when I was no longer able to access the web. asked for a replacement since I had purchased the extended warranty.  After three calls to customer service .each time I was told they would send a replacement. I just gave up.  The last time I spoke with a rep was November 12. 2013.  Two months later I received a replacement.  The battery charges just to 60% and loses charge within a hour.  Tricky thing about that extended warranty. when a replacement is sent the warranty is voided.Bottom line. spend the extra money and get a reliable tablet.,2,0,677
A395GOF7F14354,0,I really like the auto winder feature of the JB16 from Jensen. It is convenient to store in my carrying case. I dont understand how people are saying that theres dont last. they must be really be abusing them. The ear pieces retract a little fast. but at least it is out of the way because I like not having to worry about the cord. The sound quality is really good for the price. The case. that has a built in clip so you can attach to your belt. is small and sleek. Its a great bargain!,5,1,488
A39684IXREX30J,13,I bought the new Nook. and I LOVE IT! I had 2 people that DO NOT HAVE ONE try to talk me out of buying mine. Im so glad that I did not listen to them. I am disable and have to go to the Dr. alot and it comes in handy while Im waiting. as a matter of a fact me and my daughter fight over it. THE BEST THING I EVER BOUGHT! At night when I cant sleep I watch movies on Netflix and play games on it. I am sure I will have to buy my daughter one sooner or later. and my oldest grandson Loves it. he plays games and gets to read childrens books on it. Im sure sooner or later I will also have to get him one also. I tell everyone how happy I am with this product. Great to use and so small it fits in my purse.

At that point. the lobotimized CSR that answers the phone .8004095111. will tell you that all you can do is to restart it  they offer no assistance with helping you to figure out where to send it for repair or replacement.

A3979UU8820J7O,23,This is a neat product idea. it has AMFM and shortwave.  Unfortunately it also had a major problem.  If you move while listening to the radio you will lose reception.  This is especially true on AM and Shortwave.  I try to use this radio while mowing the lawn and walking the dog. and I have to keep my fingers on the tuner at all times. constantly adjusting it.

A398JGZWR6KC4O,5656,Ive had this weatherhazard monitor for about 6 months now and it has been so much of a pain that I am going to give it away or sell it.  We get flash flood warnings at least once every few weeks at 13 in the morning .and we are in no likelihood of being affected by a flash flood..  There is no way to set the unit to only alert you to certain threats  such as tornados. civil emergencies. etc.  So. if you have your county .or counties. selected. youre going to hear it if ANY alert is issued.  Sure. you could turn it off at night. but that defeats the purpose.  Setting the unit up requires following the manual. as does just about any operation besides turning the weather radio on or off .the thing REALLY is tough to use  and I work in research and development..  I hope to find another unit that will allow me to set what hazards I want to be alerted of.,2,0,861
A398O4IPFJNYZM,810,This was the second digital camera I picked up. to replace an early one that was fine for the time. but...The PDC640 takes decent pictures u0026quotfor the web.u0026quot as others have said. If that. and simple needs. are all you want. great. Do yourself a favor. though. and pick up a USB media card reader. The software and serial cable are not supported under WinXP. or on a Mac  but the images are stored on the card as .jpg files. readable anywhere. The USB reader will be *many* times faster than the serial cable. as well. and no special software is needed.If you print the pictures .full page. youll notice some problems  but if youre to the point of printing pictures. youll want a higher resoution camera anyway. It also takes a LONG time to charge. and several seconds between shots to recharge. Battery life really depends on what batteries you buy  cheap ones. itll eat like a kid with candy. Buy decent batteries .or rechargables. and theyll last a long. long time.When the batteries are ready to go. though .14 left in the indicator. the pictures get awfully dark  you can see them get darker and darker. The viewscreen will. of course. eat them faster.If you need high resolution. zoom. etc. this isnt the camera for you. For quick family pics. though. its fine.,4,1,1278
A398O678O39WL3,11,I have a Sony DVD player.  Sony claims a 1 year part90 day labor warranty.  First. the machine simply stopped working after 5 months.  Second. to send it in for warranty repair. Sony wants money for labor. upfront. plus I have to pay for the cost to ship the item.  They dont assess the problem and then give you an estimate. permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through  with a repair.  Third. when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine. their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is. buy a more reliable product. not a Sony.  Check out what the warranty. when you purchase.  Select a product with 1 year parts and labor.  Otherwise. find out what the manufacturer charges for warranty service.Watch out for deceptive warranty policies.,1,0,857
A398O678O39WL3,715,I have a .USD. Sony DVD player.  Sony claims a 1 year part90 day labor warranty.  First. the machine simply stopped working after 5 months.  Second. to send it in for warranty repair. Sony wants .USD. for labor. upfront. plus I have to pay for the cost to ship the item.  They dont assess the problem and then give you an estimate. permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through  with a repair.

A398S4LJIKED8T,33,Mine was shipped with no instruction manual or documentation whatsoever. When I plugged it in. it whirred as though it sensed a power source and then proceeded to do nothing.Doesnt work. Takes up two USB slots at once. No instruction manuals. Flimsy construction. USD22 paperweight.,1,0,282
A398T1SQBTK55M,0,For some reason I bought this motorized one for 40 bucks and also bought the nonmotorized one for 8 bucks to see which one worked better.  I tried this motorized one first and it ate my tape. which was obviously irreplaceable.  Then I tried the nonmotorized one with another tape and it worked perfectly.  Although this experiment comprised only two data points. I am comfortable concluding that it is better to buy the 8 dollar one that worked well than to buy this 40 dollar one that destroyed my memories forever.,1,0,516

A39ECAASSR4TXB,0,I was excited when my 3com Web Cam arrived from the US.  My wedding is being broadcast live on the web on July 1st as all of my relatives are US based and my bride is Canadian.  At 5 minutes to midnight on the eve of my  wedding  literally  my registration expired.  My first thought was that  they had sent me old stock.  Well they did but that wasnt the problem.  .It is upsetting when you buy the latest and greatest just to find that  they have changed the name. packaging etc. and you have last years model.It seems that to use this camera you have to go cap in hand to 3com and  purchase a License to use the software  this costing TWENTY FIVE US  DOLLARS.  This is dishonest to say the least.  I might have paid up front  but I HATED finding out the day before my wedding and after my purchase.  Also. there was no manual.  The CD has no online manual and the  doccumentation was very poor and little software was included.On the  bright side. I like the resolution and the 9 foot cable is a major  bonus.3Com  wake up and be upfront about your charges!  I will never  buy another of your products again!,1,0,1111
A39F3J9K76OQPY,5564,Just boughthooked up my unit.  Impressed with video and audio performance.  I think I can see a slight offset between the sound and the video on u0026quotGeorge of the Jungleu0026quot and u0026quotFace Offu0026quot not sure  if all DVDs players are like this... or maybe this RCA has this  characteristic? I need to rent u0026quotBugs Lifeu0026quot and look for the  problem others have mentioned. Overall good value for the money.,4,1,431

A39GQN6BRUGHKM,0,Great product. Good balance between u0026quotmust haveu0026quot and u0026quotnice to haveu0026quot functionality. Surprised at the memory capacity with u0026quotonlyu0026quot 2 Mb.

A39IV23M6S8YAK,0,For what it does I love the NookColor. However. I was promised I could listen to my audio books  with it. and yet I am not able to listen to the 4 12 years of Audible books I have in my library. I wish I had waited for an Android tablet. There had been speculation that there would be a firmware update to allow for more apps .now they are saying no. If you listen to audio books. dont expect to use a NookColor. This is a real disappointment to me.,3,0,449
A39IW4EUTMJP1Y,25,I loved this and everyone would compliment me on it. The problem with it though is that it does come apart easily. Today I realized that the flash drive part had fallen off and now I lost all of the files that I had saved on there. I wouldnt recommend buying it,2,0,261

A39MWGHNYQ9AHQ,1,Really like the CB.  I didnt want to install a full unit in my Jeep. so plugging into the 12V is sweet.The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that the portable antenna it comes with barely works at all.

This is great for a dorm room or other location to provide light security for any Kensington lock compatible device .most laptops and other portable devices have have this security port.. I have used them for several years in many environments. and they work very well.Why I like it.  Robust cable that is long enough to secure your item in most locations. reliable lock. Kensington warranty.Summary.  This was a very good deal for the lock itself. which is why I bought 2my customers are always looking for something like this.  I would have given it 5 stars. but the sellers shipping fees were pretty high.,4,1,687
A39QNMGPRGWOEG,0,I love the ease of use of the Nook. I wish there were more Nook apps. but love downloading books from my local library for free. The browser is very fast. the screen is responsive. and video streams beautifully. Because it is not the latest .HD. model.

A39RSYNK5K2UAU,12,I bought Motorola radios for our coaching staff for our youth football team. Although the radios are functional. they do not serve their purpose which is for the coaches to be able to communicate with each other during the game. Remember Charlie Browns teacher from the cartoons? That is what is heard...often undecipherable communication. We also bought these earpieces. They make matters worse. not better. Spend the extra money for more professional radios and headpieces.,1,0,475

A39UV2F5HKPO6I,1,...The SPIII seems to be the best available portable car navigation system.  It autoroutes. the maps seem accurate. and the talking directions are comforting.  Ive been using mine for about a month.  It will take you to the nearest McDonalds easily.  The menu system works well with the right thumb once you get used to it.Its getting a bit long in the tooth. being over a year old as of Feb 2001.  There is no good competition to drive an even better model.  The shortcomings have been cataloged.  bad battery life. user interface that is expert friendly. but not necessarily novice friendly a bit bulky.Here are a few quibbles that arent as widely known. The battery insertion is fiendish.  every cell seems to go in the opposite direction of the one before.  It doesnt obey the intuitive rule that the spring should always go at the negative .. end of the cell.  NiMH rechargables work well. but there is no NiMH setting on the battery type.  It wont charge your NiCD or NiMH cells while running on the car battery.  You need to do two resets to really clear the trip computer.  The trip computer isnt as useful as it could be .eg. multiple trips and gas milage computation..  The internally calculated routes often dont agree with routes done on the computer using the MapSource software.  Did I mention its bulky?Most of these problems could be addressed in a later model. but until someone comes out with something even close to the SPIII. expect Garmin to keep this one as the profitable topoftheline.  I would probably have paid .more. for a laterandgreater version.even though Im basically happy with the SPIII.Hacker challenge. Take a cheap GPS and attaching it to a GameBoy Advance for color map display and talking output.dB,4,1,1736

A39XWQCU6RDXD4,0,The nook color was a revolution when it was released a tablet device at a USD250 price point was unheard of. in a market where the USD500 iPad 2 ruled all. That was a few years ago. The nook has a few critical downsides. On the software side. it continues to run Android 2.2. which is extremely outdated. It has no native ability to install sideloaded apps. perhaps a stride to prevent pirated software. but an annoying omission nonetheless. The OMAP processor is very slow in comparison to other available chipsets. Today. at the price of USD200. one can buy an Asus Nexus 7. which has access the Google Play Store. and the ability to make use of third party apps. such as the Amazon Kindle app. the NOOK app. and the Google Play Books app. This provides competition in the eBook department so youre not locked in to one providers prices .high ones in Bu0026Ns case.. it also has a superior Nvidia Tegra 3 processor. to provide high performance gaming. while maintaining an ability to conserve battery power. Overall a better value. and by the nature of its Nexus branding. it will always run the newest version of android available. unlike many other devices. Users considering a larger screen should also consider the nexus 10.,1,0,1230
A39YGBBY3X4V1E,12,I have no complaints about the product itself.  It works and does exactly what it promised to do.  My purpose in writing this review is to warn parents purchasing this product for their child or teenagers cell phone that there is very adult material contained on the CD.There are three compressed files of photographs that. when extracted. create general folders then subfolders specifically labeled and containing various types of photos.  The photos range from innocuous cartoons to explicit nude shots. and the nude shots are not all contained in appropriately labeled folders. theyre all over the place.I also have questions about where all the content came from and whether or not the manufacturer of this product has the rights to all those images.  As a photographer who posts her work on the Internet. I think about such things.If youre an adult and dont mind having. even temporarily as you extract the files. a collection of adult photos on your computer. then this product does what it claims to do.  It was delivered quickly and in excellent condition. and I have no complaints about its functionality.My rating of 4 is because of having to delete most of the content from the CD after having to extract it all. rather than being able to cherrypick from a CD and only download what I wanted.  I also believe there should be some mention of the adult content since most children have cell phones.,4,1,1407
A39ZGVZRR82W7X,0,Ive used these CDs for data u0026amp audio. and ive never had a problem... Someone wrote to check for some kind of mark if you had a Phillips. i have a Phillips and my CDs doesnt have that mark. and theyve worked fine...,5,1,220
A3A15L96IYUO6V,22,For just a simple 10 Mbps hub. this is an excellent one for the price. It is compact and sturdy. especially with the metal casing. Link and status lights are handy along with the NormalUplink switch. No software installation needed  plug the power in and the CAT cables and youre all set!,5,1,288
A3A15L96IYUO6V,1617,I have only one complaint about this earbudmic unit  the cord is too short. Otherwise. the sound quality is good and the builtin mic with PTT works fine. A 2.5mm extension cord from radio shack .meant for phone headsets. 432003. alleviates the cord problem. however. The earbud cushion is comfortable. To be discreet. this is an excellent accessory for your Motorola FRS radio.,4,1,377
A3A15L96IYUO6V,513,This is very good headset. sound quality is good. The headband is adjustable and very confortable. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesnt do VOX with my FR50s .because the FR50 doesnt have VOX capability.. Price is reasonable too. What more can I say about a simple headset?,4,1,284
A3A19ZBW81L4SL,22,Ive owned a pair of these for four years now. They have taken a considerable amount of abuse .Im a working DJ. and still look great and function perfectly.I bought these headphones for two reasons. First. as a mobile DJ. I wanted to save my hearing. With the noisecancelling switch on. I can monitor my upcoming track and not blow out my eardrums while doing it. My second reason? I was about to take a tenhour flight from Calgary. Canada to Paris. France and Ive never been able to sleep on a plane because of the engine noise. These were PERFECT in that environment. What little engine noise still leaked through was completely gone with the volume on my CD player turned to even minimal levels.However. like a previous reviewer. I also own a pair of MDR7506 headphones. While the NCs sound great compared to your standard USD15 cheap headphones. they are not nearly as nice as the 7506s. especially for extended listening.Still. if you DJ or fly a lot. by all means look into these. They will save your sanity on a long flight. and your hearing in front of a noisy crowd.,4,1,1074
A3A1CPUI1YZW1A,4242,I purchased this alarm and thought it would have the zone alert when you get too close to it. It did not have that feature. This alarm can be had for a great price.Then I bought a remote car starting alarm for my car and sold it to my friend. I installed the bulldog 2002 on my friends  car. He seems to like it. and now I have a second order for one. Its a  decent cheap alarm system. It is VERY easy to install. Run a ground wire to  it or mount it securely to the vehicles metal. Then connect the aligator  clipon power wire. and youre all done! you need to remove a screw that  connects the alarm siren to the base. then drillscrew in the base. and put  the siren back on the base. very easy to install. I installed it in like 5  minutes. if that long. For the price. its not bad at all.Daniel,4,1,797
A3A2PH6QMN4KOU,78,I purchased these speakers some time ago for around 100 bucks.  They were  great and worth every penny.  But after a year the subwoofer mysteriously  stopped working all togather.  The satilite speakers work. which is odd  since they have to plug into the subwoofer.  It is a shame since I really  did like these speakers.  And without the subwoofer. you lose alot of the  impact these speakers had.  I did contact customer service and they pretty  much told me that I would have to spend 50 bucks to get a replacement  subwoofer.  If the subwoofer lasted longer than a year. then it would have  gotten 4 stars. Im not giving it 5 starts because the speakers do seem to  pickup radio and CB radio signals.  This get kinda annoying.  Anyway I just  ordered a 100 watts 5.1 sound system.  I just hope this sound system lasts  longer than 1 year.,3,0,843
A3A349XOW9F1Z,0,assume that youre aware that the software they ship with this unit is  garbage and that there are other decent options that are free. assume that  you dont care that the earphones that they ship with this unit is trash.  you can buy much better ones. assume that you dont need a decent manual.  You can figure it out because youre a gadgethead and by reading posts on  the net. assume that you dont care that the little carrying case is a joke.  assume that you know youll get no decent information on their web site  other than how to polish your darling rio or cute names to give it. But do  yourself a favor and read ALL the one star reviews in this list and COUNT  on your unit getting fried after an innocuous little download and COUNT on  having a grand time in customer service hell.... My sony minidisk player  was recently crushed by my rollerblades and it still works and sounds  better than the rio ever did. the rio is a fine unit... as long as it  works...,1,0,969
A3A47FTOCEK1HS,1419,I just want to say that this camera is the greatest buy. Ive been trying to wear these rechargeable batteries that come with it down for 12 hours. I get 122 pics on Standard mode. It does 2x photos and 3x viewing. Really  great buy. Totally satisfied. Between the software and the camera. Pictures  are a breeze. And the price is right. Does everything and more than cameras  Ive experienced at three times the cost.,5,1,416

A3A48XEYWLWH7T,1,Once upon a time I got sick of the gunk build up on all the mice and trackballs I had used. it got to the point where they would bump and jump on the mouse pads.  I was intrigued when I saw the technology used in the  Trackman line. detecting position using the tiny dots on the ball.  Now  having used the FX Trackman at home and at work for over 3 years. I find  that it is the still the best input device of its kind. including the new  MSFT optical mice. Once one gets used to the button placement and develops  the dexterity to utilise the trackball. constantly smooth and consistent  movement will reward them. With no moving parts for the tracking assembly  the user only rarely .once a year?. has to pop the ball out and clean the  sensors. This trackball does very well in digital art work with Photoshop  and is especially excellent when used to play classic trackball arcade  games through Mame32 emulation. Missile Command. Tempest. Centipede.  Arkanoid. etc. The tertiary buttons are recognized and used as scroll wheel  counterparts in Win2k its a nice fluff feature. My only wish would be  that Logitech eventually upgrade them to use USB so I can plug them into my  MSFT keyboards. Otherwise. highly recommended.,5,1,1228
A3A5TZ3IHOOYM9,2728,At first I thought it was little bit expensive price. but when I get it and use it. it is not. definately worth the money.This CD u0026 DVD wipes really cleans.

Thanks Amazon!,5,1,362
A3A6SM397PQUE1,0,This is a great system! I would reccomend it to anyone interested in purchasing a DSS system. I bought the dual LNB system .system with the satellite dish and 2 receivers. at WalMart for a great price of USD199.96.  Radio Shack charges USD149 for just the dish and 1 receiver. There is only  one thing bad about it .and all sytems. if you want to add more receivers  you have to buy another receiver and also have to purchase a special  digital satellite splitter .to run the cable to different rooms of your  home. because a regular splitter doesnt work correctly. which runs from  USD50USD200. Which I had to buy to add a 3rd receiver. It was a little tricky  finding just a receiver and not the whole sytem. but I did it. But overall.  this is a great buy. and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a DSS  system.,5,1,821
A3A751NO2PHPRJ,3943,I purchased the RCA CC4352 FullSize VHS Camcorder nearly 2 years ago and found it simple to use. For the price. its an excellent camcorder and it takes quality videos. The only problem Ive had is that the battery went dead after 6 months and it could no longer be recharged. The recharger works. but the battery is worthless. I have also been unable to locate a new battery. so Im limited to using the camcorder with the plugin adapter. I was also disappointed that no software came with the unit to enable the user to download pictures onto a computer.,3,0,553
A3A86P7EFFQAO3,1213,Im a Linux User. and I needed a better mouse then the supplied one .it was .not good... I felt a track ball would be good. but I was skeptical of the software I needed .as Linux is quite picky about drivers.Not a problem. the Kensington did the job. One reboot. and I was done. Im crusing through KDE with ease now.UPDATE.  Ive also been forced to use a new iMac at work now.  And this same Kengington Track Ball works very well.  Download the latest drivers to include a Scroll Wheel utility.  Very Handy.,4,1,506
A3A8A0LHL0LVU0,0,This thing is such an absolute piece of junk!After reading a few reviews. it seems people have bought this camera long ago and are still satisfied.  Well. thats fine.  You know what the problem is though?  This industry has come pretty far in two years.  This camera was a good buy at the time. now its just an outdated dinosaur.Youll likely get better image quality on the u0026quotBarbieu0026quot digital camera than this one.  Look elsewhere.Of course. if this is for a teenager and you can find it cheaper than 199 somewhere then it could be worth it for a playaroundjunk camera.,1,0,583
A3A9649I99UD3T,11,I purchased one of these a long time ago from Circuit City. and was not pleased.  Not only is it small and barely ergonomic. it has no scrollwheel and is an ugly color.  Beige is something that might have looked good back in the 90s when all computers were that color. but today. it clashes horribly with the blacks. silvers. and aluminums of todays PCs.,1,0,354
A3A9X6JBL6I96,1,My husband wakes up before I do. and with this great little radio in the shower he can listen to the radio without waking me up. As someone else remarked. the batteries seem to go on forever. Ive had mine for at least 10 years and have also given them as gifts to very appreciative friends. The AM sound is just fine for hearing the news. but the FM is a little scratchy for certain stations where we live. We use it to hear the weather report and news. though. so its great!  The presets are very handy.  This is definitely one of the best things Ive bought in my life in terms of using it and having it last. Id hate to be without it!,5,1,636
A3AAHKI7B5IMLT,33,...the Sharp 722 is all that i could ask for in a CD player replacement.  For size. it is the size of about six floppy disks stacked on top of each other.  Sound quality is excellent. and control layout is well done.  Even  the provided headphones are very nice.  My only gripe is that the  instruction manuals intructions are a little hard to grasp on the first  reading .but the unit is easy to use. and you can occasionally here the  head in the player moving when you switch songs .but it IS quiet..,4,1,503
A3ADBFNTPW4YS2,55,This is the WORST ITEM I have ever purchased from Amazon.  I am having trouble getting it returned because I have no printer and they did not include a paper with my order. Just the cord.  As far as the cord.  The  male  end of the cord will not go into the  female  part of my Nexus.  This is utter garbage.  Lesson learned  I guess when  a cord is needed go to the actual store and make them try it out on your electronic equipment.  I didnt think it would be that big of a deal.  This CORD IS JUNK.,1,0,501
A3AEA2TVFS4JNE,22,Believe it or not. I ordered this camera on the Web by u0026quotaccidentu0026quot. but now that Ive used it. you couldnt pry it out of my fingers with a crow bar.  I somehow  clicked on u0026quotpurchaseu0026quot on  a web sight that will go unnamed because three days later a federal express  box arrived at my house. Although I was disturbed at first that I had  somehow ordered something without intending to. I  am not sending this  camera back.  No way!  It is deceptively simple looking. but this masks a  ton of features.  The pictures are superb and very easy to upload to a PC  and send as EMail.  I havent had it long enough to run into a battery  problem.but the reviews here clearly see that as a problem.  I suspect I  will buy the battery recharger someday soon.Join the digital age.  Buy  this camera.  You will not be disappointed.,4,1,847

A3AH1GJGOS6SUM,33,This has to be one of the worst keyboards Ive ever tried to use.  Some of the keys wont press down unless you hit them dead center and press straight down  the other option is to press very hard. which is the only option if youre trying to type with any real speed.  After only a couple days. my wrists ache.  The keys that do work consistently have an awful. mushy feel. and they require too much pressure.This keyboard an ergonomics nightmare.,1,0,445
A3AHGXV71R7JZS,0,The products themselves are great! They were packaged well. and I have had no problems at all with the quality.  It took a little longer than I expected to receive the items.

A3AKB4GVGGWIVI,0,This would have been a typical 5 star review for this item. Like most people who buy this I have more than one primary area where I use my computer.  I have a Compaq Armada portable and have 2 docking stations....one at home and at work.  I needed 1 cradle for each so I bought the second cradle.  The 2nd cradle loses 2 stars simply because it was the wrong color.  Cradle was gray. while the palm IIIxe and the cradle that came with it. are black. Why?  Be advised cradle received may not match your black Palm IIIxe in color.,3,0,528
A3AKVALGT4Y02G,822,For the money you cant go wrong. Yes. it has a litlle play in the mechanism but. you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that. It works great and frees up counter space. I would do it all again. Why spend 3 times more.,4,1,221
A3AM7EYYHKD7A,56,Better because the included software allows programming u0026quotwheel buttonu0026quot to several different specialized operations .Next Window is my favorite.. 100% compatible with IntelliMouse. However. if you try use the  Kensington software with a real IntelliMouse there can be problems using  this feature because the wheel in and IM has weaker springs and you will  inadvertantly press the wheel button over and over when you scroll.  Better because it is a lot less expensive but constructed just a good.,5,1,512
A3AMG5K4VMJUAI,0,I love this tablet. Its a powerful little machine with an array of free apps and books. Its easy to hold and use and charges quickly. The only interface issues I have are. fingerprints easily seen on screen and the charge plug is at the bottom of the tablet. so its hard to rest it on something while its plugged in and you want to read. There are some apps Id like for this product that I cant get yet. but Im not overly worried about those. This does what it was paid to do! I can seamlessly go online. read books. listen to music. watch youtube. play games. and much more. Its faster than a Kindle Fire .in my experience. and is generally a great deal for the price.,4,1,669

A3ANC0I87XXWAV,12,I bought this radio.the first edition. about 6 years ago. for the looks and as a conversation piece with my Cigar Humidor and 1900s work desk.  The tuning was iffy. the lighted dial poor. shortwave?  Who Cares?  Really didnt get it for that...the piece acted as a great conversatiion piece for several years. until my wife purchased a XM radio setup for my birthday last year.....the AUX function was perfect. the dim lighting didnt matter.because of the XM....and the sound is much better than some of the nimrods on this site claim.....allinall its still a great conversation piece. and now thanks to XM. a nice useful radio...especially when playing the Old Time Channel on XM.....perfect!Rate it a 2 for the first five years of ownership. rate it a 4+ now.,3,0,760
A3ANEPKHJTIFTE,33,I really just wanted the cable to connect my smart phone to my computer. but was pleased .initially. to get a wall and car charger in the mix.

A3AQ9W6ZSOM9B2,0,Ive had the nook color for well over a year now.  It is a great ereader. and I would definitely buy it again.  My two year old can easily navigate to her books. and I love that some of the books will read to her.  There is a good selection of kids books for a decent price. too.  I use overdrive a lot .an online library. and it works really well.  My only issue is that occasionally when I try to turn the screen on. it doesnt recognize my finger sliding to unlock the screen.  Simply turning the screen off and back on fixes this. however.  For something like this. that doesnt even count as an issue!  Overall. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a good ereader.,4,1,686
A3AQRXDA6Z7MVC,11,I like this CD player a lot.  At only USD. it is a very goodbuy.  I saw it at Best Buy for USD and Amazon.com was much cheaper.Although the ESP works great. the sound does skip sometimes for no apparent reason.  I recommend the other CD player by Sony with a headphone remote.  But this is a very good buy.,4,1,306
A3AR7HB5P60IAY,1012,Eventhough this is made by the same folks that make Panisonic stuff it works great! It has lot of cool stuff. like a blue light that lights up the display. you may want to turn this off or on. On with all the lights off  and some jazz playing makes for a great night! Some lowlights are. it only  holds one CD so you have to keep getting up and changing the CD when you  are done.  It has another good feature called CD Text. this will list the  songs for you on a screen. You can have it scroll or just view a portion of  the title. .Not all CDs have this option. Check this out.

A3ARJW4QTGLTVO,0,If youve ever bought a shower radio .Ive bought u0026amp tried several.. you know that they all s*k. This is the first one that DOESNT s*k. Not the slightest bit. This one is fantastic.Its got a digital tuner  no dealing with tiny tuning knobs and guessing if youre on the right station. Its got an accurate digital clock. Its got weather band. Its got tv audio .channels 2 thru 13.. Its got an antenna wire with a suction cup at the end so you can actually better tune in your station. All the function buttons are simple u0026amp waterproofed. The sound is great  for a mono shower radio. Its got a heavy duty string to hang it on your shower head. or just set it on any flat surface  its solid and will stay still. And to top it off. 3 C batteries in this thing last forever  instead of a single 9 volt or a few AAs that other shower radios usually have. Sony did good here.Just buy it. Then buy another whenever you cant think of a good gift to get someone  people LOVE getting this as a gift. Ive given several.,5,1,1016
A3ARUP70UZNZFP,1752,In my opinion. the Brother PTouch label maker is one of the best inventions that mankind has invented. Blows ridiculous things like Ipods and cell phones out of the water in terms of real world practicality. Makes em look almost prehistoric.This is the tape replacement refill for the PTouch. a neccesity to make the machine work. much like gas for your car.I installed my refill and made more labels. What more can I say? Its label tape. it works!,5,1,448

A3AVDBLKNGXYB7,0,I needed a USB cord for my Blackberry Bold 9000 so I came onto Amazon to look for a cheap one. I found this one and I quickly ordered it.It took a VERY long time to finally get mailed to my house! I ordered this item with 3 other pieces of merchandise. and this arrived last. several weeks later than everything else. I was very upset with the time it took to get to my house!!! But in the end. it is durable and I use it all the time with my Blackberry and laptop! I would recommend this item. but only if the shipping time was reduced by 90%!!!,4,1,546
A3AWHP14DZZX,11,Its perfect. nothing to say more. Very well done. It should be made also for righthanded people inverting the positioning of kindle and paper. Kindle of the left side and paper on the right should be better to work with.,4,1,220
A3AX1J0PA2B7NW,0,This was exactly.  what I wanted.  The software is outdated and using the keyboard takes some getting used to. but if you want a handheld device to jot down thoughts and ideas. it works well.,4,1,191
A3AYWXCN9BPCV3,0,I purchased this amplifier about three days ago.  I had been looking for quite some time looking at sony. pioneer. denon. yamaha. morantz. onkyo. and some others that were so expensive I cant even remember the names of  them.  Of all the brands I looked at I chose this one because of the things  I had heard about it from friends.  With cost being no factor I wanted  something dependable. sleek. powerful. and good sounding.  This reciever is  all that and then some.  My home theater is now complete.  Compared to  the other brands I looked at .including the USD5000.00 ones.. this one seemed  more reasonablely priced and more so high quality.  It sounds great. looks  great. it is great.  Thanks to the JVC engineering.  I needed  something that was compatible with my DVD player and something that would  sound great with my music.  I have front speakers that were USD1200 for the  pair and I needed something that was powerful enough and clear enough for  them.  This amp is.  I would reccommend it to any future buyers looking for  one. not to mention it does have a very nice light set on the face of it.  That just adds to the look of the home theater.  Im glad my friends  reccommended this to me.  Thanks guys!,5,1,1222

A3B07Y3E090DM,0,This product is probably good for beginners or the occasional computer user who wish to save a few files.

A3B13LMUA48TVT,0,Very disappointed in purchasing 2 of these. one for my wife and one for myself. We learned a couple months after purchasing different books on both devices that we could only loan the book out to the other device one time only for a 14 day period. Both of us typically read over lunch breaks and it takes longer than that to finish a book. Yes I do realize that we can just trade nooks back and forth though for the price of a ebook and the actual book I would rather purchase a hard copy of the book.,2,0,501
A3B1CIYWDWTMQJ,14,Recently. I used the Motorola TalkAbout 250 radios on a New Mexico Elk Hunt.  Without doubt. I recommend these radios to any outdoor enthusiast.  On the road. in the mountains. at the mall. these devises sure come in  handy.  Battery life is great. as well as. the crystal clear sound and  range of the product.,5,1,311
A3B2UIEIP5ZXXB,3536,I bought 3 of these to go with our motorola hand held radios. the transmit audio on all 3 units is so distorted you can not make out what the person is saying. The ear bud works OK.  I am very disappointed with this expensive microphone.,1,0,237
A3B2X7BT9UCAR3,0,An excellent and rugged machine. Ive used it in teaching for two years.  The only drawback is the relatively poor resolution LCD.  However. with free software. such as WayPoint. you can easily convert to high resolution graphics.,4,1,229
A3B3DPD8GHIN0B,77,Having played with this for a couple of days I have to admit Im impressed. I previously owed the 1950s DVD box set using the Bondi software as well. and this feels more refined and faster. Ive been able to easy index various contributors and articles and save them for later.The quality of the scans arent great. In some cases there are water stains or scribbles on the pages. Its possible that was the best they had. since lets face it I doubt Hugh Hefner and company were thinking of posterity early on in the magazines run. Printing in particularly is pretty disappointing. At the very least it would have been nice to include the option to read transcribed text like Zinio and other software offers. That said. on a computer screen everything should be fairly readable.As others have mentioned. the quality of the pictures is also an issue. In fact I was really shocked to find out this 250gb harddrive has 215gb free. Youd think with all that space theyd scan these documents in a higher resolution. or at least offer some extras like separate folders with highrez shots of Playmates. It seems like a lost opportunity which Playboy may be kicking themselves for now. When I inquired via email on the 1960s DVD box set they immediately offered me a ..... off coupon for this set. which would indicate it isnt selling as well as they had hoped.Which is kind of sad. because for all its faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles. pictures. even advertisements are great to read. Sure Id like higher quality scans. but I own both the Rolling Stone and National Geographic box sets and poor quality scans are an issue for all digitized magazines. So grab it while you can. because I have a feeling this wont be on the market for that long.,4,1,1782
A3B3HBKN6PR2N7,89,These Motorola mics worked great for our GMRS radios.  Our crew prefers using these in the attics instead of pulling the walkies out of their pocket or belt clips.Speaker. When you plug in the microphone the sound you hear come out of the mic When you press the transmit button on the mic or the radio the microphone acts like a microphone. Sound quality is nice Volume is adjustable by volume control on radioCord. My main gripe is the cord The coiled cord on the new mics are tight from waist to shoulder By stretching the coil out this problem goes away. Almost wish that the cord came prestretched so the new cords werent so tight.Clip. The clip clips at the top of the mic. It would have been better if the clip swiveled on the back of the mic as everyone doesnt like to clip the mic on their shoulder lapel or collar. I prefer the mic in front of me and being able to swivel the clip would have been a major plus.Quality. The mics are high quality and work well.  Out of the 8 I ordered I only had to return 1 due to failure right out of the package.Overall. great mics at a descent price.  At first the cord will be annoying but with time it should stretch and work better on adults. May look a little funny though if all your kids had these mics on their shoulders. People may give you strange looks.,4,1,1308

You can imagine my surprise and disappointment when the radio wouldnt catch the station my husband likes to listen to. The reception is horrible!

A3BB0505JHZO6L,2122,This latest incarnation of the Palm III adds memory and the capability to expand. a little.  While lacking the sex appeal of the Palm V and the Dick  Tracy like abilities of the Palm VII. the IIIx also lacks its siblings  extravagant price tags.  With 4 megs of memory. there is plenty of room for  data with enough left over to add some favorite software.  The IR port  makes it possible to beam data to Palm owning friends and the solid. no  frills operating system and software are easy to use and crash free.  If I  had a complaint. it would be that graffiti is not as intuitive as I would  like.  It could have something to do with my sloppy writing. but the Palm  seems so smart in other ways that I expect it to do better.  Still.  Graffiti is more than adequate for entering the occasional appointment or  business card.  This Palm has performed for me as advertised.  My life is  more organized and I have more valuable information at my fingertips.  It  is reliable and easy to use.,4,1,992

A3BBS9KAVMFH5T,1,Last summer I bought a camera D340 Olympus and I am truly satisfied with it and I agree with most of the reviews. The problem was when I tried to find service due to an strange condition the smart media is OK. Batteries  are OK. but there is an error condition the led keeps flashing. the manual  is not helpful because did not give a way to solve it. I have been triying  to find an answer in order to fix the problem an in three month nobody from  Olympus service help me to fix the problem or gave an appropiate advise. I  am in south america Caracas Venezuela and there is no place to service the  Camera. So if you are out of USA and thinkink in buying Olympus be aware  that there is no service and there is no answer from Olympus Service  Department.Thanks,2,0,763
A3BBV0X70CA3T,66,My School recently purchased a Dazzle DVC parallel port package and assigned me with the task of setting it up.  Running it on a P3 450. it functioned very nicely after we got a PCI sound card .ISA really messed up  the audio when outputting to VHS..  Although the final resoulution is  limited to 352x240 when put on vhs it looks fine.  Ive experienced no sync  problems.  The only problem still unresolved is that the video is captured  as MPEG and in order to be put to VHS must be rendered as MPEG after  editting.  because of this double compression some quality is lost.,4,1,576
A3BCJVW1CF3MU4,1314,These are OK when new. but after a while they suddenly fail and then are only good for a few shots.  This often happens if you leave them in the charger too long. but it is not convenient watching the charger for 2 hours to see when it is done.  All 3 I have bought have failed in this way.It seems that there is a diode inside that fails allowing the charge to leak out throught the center contact.  When this happens. just stick a piece of duct tape over the center contact before you put it in the camera and it is as good as new.  Remove the duct tape to recharge it.,3,0,571

A3BJOJLK4FN1JC,12,I bought this for my tablet .Ainol Novo 7A. which features mini HDMI out and the ability to play really high bitrate content. and 3D bluray rips.  I liked this cable because of the small profile at the mini HDMI end and I figured the thin cable would provide less strain on the tablets port.Cutting to the chase  Id get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback.  Always the same scenes. at the exact same time  so it wasnt a fit issue.  But the scenes played perfectly when I switched back to my old adapter and cable.  Also  I found I wasnt able to play big .20 gig+. 3D rips. when the other cable could.So . . . for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine.  I suspect this cable will be fine for the Tegra 2 tablets .Original Transformer. Galaxy Tab. Acer Iconia. etc.. since playback is generally limited to 720P.  But if you play high quality video  it could be a problem  I dont know what the actual limitation is.,3,0,937

The store. starting up and loading books and everything else is pretty fast and reliable.The option to either tap the page. use the buttons located on either sides or slide the page are all nice to be able to choose and the page isnt overly touchy or anything.The only thing I had a HUGE problem with  and maybe its just mine. but  there is a problem when connecting to certain wifi connections and Ive read about other people having the same problem. I dont know how to fix it and Customer Service has been little help.

A3BP1GBV2VPHYK,0,I posted a review two weeks ago. but it hasnt appeared. so Im trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  .Note.  despite what some other reviewers seem to think. it does NOT have a motion detector  thats a different lock..  Recently. the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook. despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targuss customer support. I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently. the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  Im going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook. I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus.,1,0,736

The only thing that could have been better is that the subwoofer isnt very strong.  If youre looking for thunderous bass. this isnt what you want.  Thats why the price is so low.  But if youre looking for a nice addition to your current speakers. and for a decent price. this is great.  Its really easy to set up.,4,1,493
A3BQKL1GKB6HTM,0,This is my second GPS unit and by far the best. I do not need the in built map function. in some cases my 4WD club goes where no man has gone before.  A great tool for navigating around the sand dunes and scrub in Western  Australia.  Ideal for my hobby which is 4 Wheel driving going away for  weekend just to get lost really.  The trac back feature is fantastic.  Good  in tree cover as well.  Overall very impressed.,5,1,419
A3BRJW85SMKZF,3030,The unit works flawlessly.  Unfortunately. many software applications that still require floppy disks dont recognize USB floppy drives.  My app is one of those.  I have a partial workaround.  I run the software as administrator and despite receiving an error message that no floppy drive exists. the drive starts working.  Go figure.  The 3 stars represents a warning to the buyer to make sure that their applications recognize USB floppy drivers.,3,0,447
A3BRZVKNOE66B4,0,I am not satisfied with this product. You need the plastic cases in order for the minidiscs to fit. Do they tell you that in the description. NOPE! I bought two and wasted my money. Now they sit... and sit...,1,0,208
A3BS7VFNYH7CTE,36,I owned a Panasonic A110 for 16 months.  For that time. the unit functioned flawlessly and I was very happy with it.Then the OPU .Optical Pickup Unit. failed like everyone elses .cost to repair. USD225!..  This is a well documented problem with the A110. A115. A120 and A310  series.  Most newer players have a corrected OPU. but watch out.I have  since purchased a Sony S550D which I have been very pleased with!,1,0,413
A3BSI1VPAYF00D,88,It arrived as described with usbcable attached  The only negative point about it. the cord is too short.  Cord should be twice the length so that it can be placed in a spot convenient to reach the usb port.  It is reading my floppies just fine so far and hope it continues as I have lots of embroidery files on them which I need to access.,4,1,339
A3BSI7KS8TI0ZL,0,I bought this to listen to tapes on the subway.  I was suprised at the high quality of sound from the radio and tape playback.  There is minimal background noise.  It is also very light weight. making it easy to carry  around.  The two things I didnt like are the earphones which are large and  clumsy. it works better with earplugs. and the volume switch which is low  set and sometimes difficult to turn to adjust the volume.  Overall I am  very satisfied with this product.,4,1,476
A3BSSJ6SJ5NVWJ,2525,Two of the batteries never worked. I contacted them about replacements and they wanted me to jump through so many hoops I just figured it was not worth the effort. Lesson learned.,1,0,179
A3BU1UYA0V7C3O,0,I am willing to do start ratings and a word or two fro every purchase.

Production values are very good.,5,1,307
A3BU4RJUIRF4WP,12,As an Ergonomics Consultant with more than 20 years of experience I can say that this trackball is the BEST trackball Ive ever seen .if used in a negative slope keyboard tray.. I still have mine... and pray that it will keep working. since they dont make this model any more. The new Kensington Expert Mouse trackball .black and silver. is a  hot mess . It creates EXTREME wrist extension if used on a flat surface.and even in a keyboard tray that tilts negatively it still creates an awkward and harmful posture for the wrist unless the user  hovers  over the trackball while using it. .which NO ONE does!.I cant understand why Kensington took a perfectly good product away and replaced it with a ridiculously designed one! Must have been a marketing and  design  committee that came up with the new design. it couldnt have possibly been created or approved by an Ergonomics expert! .Unless the  expert  was hired by the design and marketing team...I sent my comments to Kensington. but as expected I didnt even get a response... .. After recommending this model to literally thousands of clients over the years .which resulted in thousands of purchases!. youd think they would listen a little better.... Well actually no. you wouldnt. Im  Polly Anna ... ..,5,1,1258

A3BW62DOHRGAI2,34,1.  They really do work well.  You must realize they dont cancel *all* noise out. but for airplanebuslawnmoweretc... noise they do a great job.2.  They fit very well. and are comfortable for long plane flights .i.e. Japan to USA. 12 hours.3.  Being a classical musician for over 12 years. I can tell you that the sound quality on these is excellent...4.  ...Plus. they have the short cord style which works so well with MiniDisk playersPu003eAnd thats all I have to say about that.,5,1,481
A3BX0UKIY07EGU,1718,My husband bought the S360 because it was supposed to be a great DVD player.  We had the player for just over one year when it stopped playing the majority of our DVDs.  The player tells us that we need to Insert Disc. even though the disc has been inserted.  We have cleaned the player. cleaned the discs. read all of the troubleshooting literature and followed each guideline.  Still this player will only play one of our many DVDs.Our redemption at this point is that we bought an extended warranty and can get it repaired.Ive always loved Sony products. but I am very disappointed with this one.,2,0,599
A3BXKBFCUJMQZT,35,Bought this Nook for my mom for her birthday.  She absolutely loves this Nook. she has already read three books. Best purchase I have made in a while.,5,0,150
A3BXW1Y28K4ULA,0,The static noise level generated from the jack is so high that it is practically not useful for a phone jack extension.,1,0,119
A3BY5KCNQZXV5U,23,This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind. You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate. The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place. On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid. It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.,5,1,974
A3BY5KCNQZXV5U,78,I have had this radio for 3 years. It has worked well and has good sound quality as well as very decent shortwave performance for the price.Pros. Great value for price and I recommend the purchase if you want a good shortwave radio with stereo FM capability.  The cons which follow would not prevent me from making this purchase again.Cons. The packaging is .injection molding plastic fitfinish and design. is poor and much like a product that costs USD20.  It has not failed but just leaves a bad taste compared with Japanese competition.  What is worse is the legend for the features that one would use in low light conditions such as alarm is medium blue against black. small letters.  They cant be read easily in normal light. much less normal household lighting.  The logic is typically German...like my 2 VWs...they seem to do things in a way that is different from anyone else and thus it is not intuitive without reading the manual...again. if it is a seldom used feature.  Also. a tone control instead of a switch would have been nice as well a ability to charge batteries while plugged in.,4,1,1099

A3C0DCOEQGMHD6,11,Great sound. for a shower radio.  NOT waterproof. water resistant.  Battery compartment does not have a watertight seal.  Awesome reception!  Price is a bit high.  You would think that Sony would have made this waterproof.  Had this been the case. I would not say that it was a bit overpriced.  Non the less. I feel that it is a great shower radio.,4,1,348
A3C0TBOVWANO6X,0,Very poor instructions.Hard to determine when disc is through cleaning.A cd played after the  cleaning  still had garbles.,1,0,122
A3C1GV89DSSCEB,0,I have not bought this product and tested it. and have no plans in doing so.  However. I justify my rating of 1 star simply because the price is too high for this technology.  Amazon in its review mentioned that you can buy a networking kit TEN TIMES FASTER for the SAME or LESS price. and I totally agree!!  It is simply not logical to purchase this item. it is a riffoff.  Youre paying more for less!Find other networking kits here which are faster and cheaper alternative like. Linksys FESWSK5 EtherFast Switched 10100. Linksys FESWSK5 EtherFast Switched 10100. DLink DFE910 10100 NetworkInABox with 5 Port Switch. etc.,1,0,622

A3C2NE7KBGKH56,0,It is surly a shame that I have to write this sad review. Why? Because I like the Nook. very much. however do not call Barnes and Noble support for anything.  I am on the phone now as I type this.  I have been on the phone with customer support for 35 minutes. Twenty minutes on hold right now.Here is the problem I bought a 3g nook at the store.  I tried to get the 3G part to work and never could figure it out. So on mothers day as a treat I went by myself.no kids. to the Barnes and Noble Store to ask what I was doing wrong. Apparently I was doing nothing wrong I got a defective nook.  So they said I should return my nook to the company .not through the store. and they are sending me a new nook in its place after I gave my credit card to insure I would return it. Great sounds good. Today on my porch is my new Nook YEah!!! No not good I open the box and it says preowned certified nook. I paid 199 for my new nook that was defective and the preowned nook costs 139 online.  With tax and all that. the  difference is 71 dollars. I should get refunded money plus something for all the time I spent with this. I spent and hour at the store trying to resolve this and now it looks like I will be on the phone for an hour too. Two freaking hours for what? I paid for a defective NOOK and they are giving me a preowned one. How does that make sense? It does not. THey are waiting for me to hang up they keep telling me they are all in a meeting. THis is not good.DO NOT BUY A NOOK NOR DO NOT CALL CUSTOMER SUPPORT THIS IS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.,1,0,1548
A3C2UDF6VF1RHU,913,I didnt research because I thought all stylus were the same. The only stylus I have found for the iPhone has a tip as big as your finger so I dont understand the point of using it.,3,0,180
A3C3YEFSJ78TLV,11,I purchased this product on the advise of a coworker.  I downloaded a few free nook books with no problem.  However. the most difficulty was purchasing books.  What an utter disappointment.  This products is extremely slow and international customers are unable to purchase books.  I followed someones advise of purchasing a gift card.  After three days my efforts were futile.  I also tried purchasing books from other sites and was unable to download.  International customers PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE this junk.  Save your money.  Im about to throw this piece of crap into the garbage.,1,0,586
A3C47SSEI4BWP4,0,It was so hard to find this product in the stores. But one sales clerk refered me to this site ans here is where I found it! Im glad to have it so I can clean my fathers tape player like it needs to be done.,4,1,207
A3C51ESBUD8QAJ,22,Another great buy from Amazon. The local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made. this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it,4,1,182
A3C53T1EYBLD0X,0,Its a nice player at a good price. Everything works perfect. The display and controls are all logical and easy to read.The box in came in looked like it had taken quite a beating during shipping and I was leery to accept it. Once opened. the unit didnt have a scratch on it and works perfect.The only thing I can say that is not good is that it does not have a place to plug in a microphone as most cassette playerrecorders have. Other than that I would highly recommend this product.,4,1,484
A3C5JFSAPHWJU3,33,Works fine for my purpose. a wireless speaker I can move wherever I want to listen to my main stereo.  I use it in the kitchen and by the pool. which are not wired for my stereo.  Sounds about as good as an inexpensive boom box and has a good range.,5,1,249
A3C62UXZWUCZNG,11,Ive had this player for over a year now and all I can say is that it is extremely durable and a joy to listen to.  .Bad. headphones outofthebox.  Be sure to get a new pair.  Also. the bundled software has bugs. so youre best bet is to download the latest version from .website..  After putting up with these initial glitches. it has not given me any problems.  It handles well during exercise as well.  Overall. its definitely worth the price.,4,1,443
A3C72GH1AETB5S,0,These Yamaha headphones are perfect for my use.  to be able to hear my horn when Im overdubbing parts in a recording session .listening to prerecorded music tracks while playing live.. These headphones allow me to really hear the natural sound of my horn .trombone. while enabling me to hear what Ive playing over..... they sound great!   also. these phones are great to use when practicing and playing along with CD tracks or iPod tracks for playing jazz. etc. They have a high impedence. so they require you to crank up the volume to get some sound in the phones. but theyre perfect for playalong use.,5,1,603
A3C7D2U4YA3FKL,22,My sons Nook HD shut down during use.  We charged it for several days u0026 it would not turn on.  We researched trouble shooting suggestions on the web. all of which did not work. I then resorted to calling Bu0026N. Unfortunately I did not have the serial  on first call to them so had to speak to two different representatives regarding the issue.  I tried troubleshooting advice the first rep. gave me to no avail.hence the need for the serial number. Bottom line. I am getting the Nook HD replaced!!!  Yaay to Bu0026N for that.  Issues. customer service.  Both reps could use more training on customer service skills.  They handled the situation.  Period. The first one sounded like she was not fully awake or maybe had been out late last night.  The second rep. sounded like he just needed the biggest cup of coffee in the world!  Yes. my Nook HD is being replaced. I am happy for that.  Do I feel like I am a valued customer according to the two reps I spoke to?  No. I feel like I was an inconvenience into their day.  Bu0026N. more Customer Service training please.,3,0,1073
A3C7K032IBKRGA,0,This product is very easy to use.

A3C8BX4NANAVHQ,0,The collapsible design of these headphones is excellent.  Unfortunately. the acoustic design is not up to the same standard.  These headphones actually exacerbate the engine noise on some airplanes which defeats the primary use I have for them.  I traded headphones with the Bose owner next to me on a flight and the difference in noise reduction was significant and decidely in favor of the Bose model.  My son now uses the Sony headphones on the ground but I use Bose headphones for my airline travel.,2,0,503
A3C8MMXGKSIF3A,1718,I bought this casette deck 1.5 years ago. looking for something that would be decent to last me through grad school.  I dub a fair amount of tapes .I buy most of my music on vinyl. for myself and friends. so I wanted  something of decent quality.  Well. after 1.5 years of moderate use. the  record head seems to have quit on me.  Im going to look into fixing it.  but I feel that it will be foolish to sink more money into this after it  broke in such a short time.  For my money I think Im going to bite the  bullet and go with a cdr component instead.,2,0,554

A3C9H4UQM2HXJL,0,I have the parallel version of this device and have not had the benefit of encountering any usb related problems. however. most of the reviews here  are misplaced. most of these other reviews sound as if these people bought  the wrong product. the Dazzle DVC is a mpeg encoder. which means it is best  suited for computer files. lowresolution for emails to highresolution  for presentation. a cdrw drive is a must once you have this item. i have  backed up several hours of family movies and made many copies on cdr. you  can put 1 hour of good quality video on a cdr that costs less than USD.75 .  perfect to pass many copies to family and friends. with the right software  you can even make a video cd .vcd. which can be played on about onethird  of dvd players.  If youre looking to make vhs tapes out of your  editing process youd be better served with a video capture card. for the  most part the Dazzle DVC is mostly about mpeg files. the video capture  cards that have to be installed into a computer do not offer the range of  features that the Dazzle does.,5,1,1065
A3C9PAY5GUMDJ1,8789,I have an old set of Kenwood radios with external speaker mics. but they are getting old. So I bought a pair of motorola GMRS radios and these external speaker mics. I must say. they feel really well built. They are solid. with a good clip. There is just one problem.  They suck.  Talking and listening through these things is like talking and listening through a pillow. It was such a disappointment. I had to ask my friends to keep repeating themselves. Now I have to shop all over again. Dont get these.Oh. and I should add that its not the radios. They sound good until you plug these mics in.,1,0,597

A3CC3I9M28ONDO,13,The Agfa 780c is great for posting pictures on the internet and sending in emails.  It does not have as high a resolution as some of the newer cameras but if you are printing small photos or not printing at all just sending them across the internet it works great.  As far as batteries go all digital cameras with an LCD screen are hard on batteries. rechargables help.  I added an 8mg card to mine and was able to get 50+ photos in high res!!  I have been very happy with my camera and have had it for over 1 year.,4,1,515
A3CCVSXICCKQ89,11,it does not work go for the machine. I bought this and I do regret it because it ruined my game,1,0,95
A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,11,In brief. the Voodoo3 is a 2D3D Voodoo2. but faster. It doesnt do anything particularly novel .theres a tv output. but no texture compression or bumpmapping. for example.. but its extremely quick for the  money. and sure to become cheaper as the Voodoo5 gains a foothold. Its a  better bet than the 2000  its faster. has a TVout .which you will  probably never use. but its nice to know that you can.. and isnt much  more expensive. Comparing it with the 3500 is tricky. however  whilst the  3500 is fractionally quicker. its sold more on its multimedia  capabilities. The lack of 32bit colour is a shame  in the games that  support it. the visual gains are noticeable. but it hits performance. and  is only essential if youre playing the 32bit only Delta Force 2. As  others have noted. it gets quite warm in operation. but you dont really  need a fan  just ensure that your PCI cards are distanced from the AGP  socket.,4,1,921
A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,79,These are currently available on eBay for pennies. They are not old enough to be antiques. and not new enough to be valuable. and they do not have a culty reputation. In fact there is very little about them on the internet. They are however capable cameras. I have run a couple of rolls through mine. and the lens was sharp and clear. It is basically an Olympus Stylus Zoom 105 with a leathery covering. neither of which are bad things.As far as I can tell there was an original Olympus LT1 model. which had a more expansive leather case and a fixed lens. which was followed by the LT Zoom 105. which is this. Olympus has not repeated the experiment. The LT 105 is an autofocus. autoexposure pointandshoot 35mm compact camera with a builtin flash. It has no manual features. It fits into a pocket. and it is weatherproof. It is comfy to hold and has a lens that zooms from 38105mm. It takes a single CR123 battery. The case feels warm and leathery. although it is synthetic. The camera can sense DX encoding. The lens goes from f4.5 to f8.9. which is decent for this kind of camera although not spectacular. The speed feels retrogressive  the previous generation of fixedlens pointandshoots were f2.8. and the popular rangefinders of the 1970s were f1.7 or thereabouts. I suppose the flash compensates for this. You can turn the flash off. There are several flash modes. although I have not used them. It is light. but feels tough. as if it would survive a drop onto grass. and probably a short drop onto concrete. It does not have an accessory shoe. The lens does not have a filter thread. There is an electronic selftimer. The film transport mechanism and shutter are both electrically powered. According to the manual. the shutter goes from 1500 to four seconds. The tripod socket is under the right edge of the camera. below the battery compartment.There is nothing wrong with the pictures. The exposure is fine and the lens is sharp and clear. although I did not take anything with the camera zoomed in. and I did not test the camera. I took some shots of traffic at night. and they came out. The autofocus seems to work. although I worry that there isnt a manual focus mode .in fact the camera refuses to take a picture at all if the subject is closer than 0.6m.. The camera has some usability quirks. and overall I prefer my older Olympus XA2. The XA2 does not have autofocus. DX encoding. zoom. auto wind. or a builtin flash. but it is smaller. handier. has a brighter and larger viewfinder. and a faster and slightly wider lens.The LTs first problem is the viewfinder. which is small and dim. It is very poor. In low light I can barely see anything through the finder. In fact. when the light is dim I can barely find the viewfinder at all. let alone see through it. Part of the problem is that it is directly in the centre of the cameras back. If it had been an inch to the left. it would have been easier to look through. If your head is not aligned straight down the middle of the finder. it is opaque.The camera is noisy. When you turn it on. the motor moves the lens into place. When you take a picture. the motor winds to the next frame of film. and when you finish a roll the motor winds the film back. When you zoom. the motor whirrs. It is a loud motor. Even in a restaurant. people around you will know that you are taking pictures. In contrast. the Olympus XA2 is basically silent. Furthermore you can easily take the XA2 out of your pocket. open it up. and put it back in for later use. The L105 is pocketsized when it is turned off. but the lens protrudes when you turn it on. The lens caps protrudes even more. The lens cap deploys downwards. and acts as a makeshift stabiliser. or a titchy lens hood if you hold the camera upsidedown. The lens cap doesnt retract when you turn the camera off. and its easy to forget this. Several times I tried to put the camera back into my pocket. and the lens cap got caught up in my clothes. Its my own fault. I suppose. Like all the brightwork on the front of the camera. the lens cap is plastic. There is no place for an alternative lens cap. and I imagine that spare lens caps are as rare as hens teeth. Hens dont have teeth. you see. That is where that saying comes from. A hen is a type of chicken. They have beaks.The zoom lens protrudes almost three inches from the camera. It is undeniably phallic. although less than half the size and girth of a real phallus. If you erect the lens to its fullest engorgement. people around you will grin. It zooms quickly. although noisily. The camera looks silly with the lens zoomed out. although it is unfair to dock points for this. and I will not. The zoom range is handy. but f8.9 at 105mm is very slow. At that level its basically a portrait lens for good light outdoors  and you wont be taking sharp longrange shots at air shows. or candid portraits of your sunbathing neighbours. it doesnt zoom that far.And in all likelihood you wont be taking any shots with this camera at all. It is a film camera. and falls into a nether region. as I explained at the top of the review. Its not old or curious or definitive or posh enough to be valuable. and for the kind of shots you are likely to take. a digital camera would be a superior choice. Mountaineers and sentimental photographers who need a backup will probably go for a stylish and slightly culty Olympus XA. or one of the regular Stylus models. and nostalgic photographers will want something made of metal with manual focus. For itself. its a decent point u0026 shoot. but the tide of history has ebbed away from it.The other reviewers mention a problem with winding. I have not experienced this. but then again I have only run two rolls of film through the camera. so I cant comment except to say that I cant comment.,4,1,5784
A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,55,Essentially. this is the entrylevel. 16bit audio Creative Labs sound  card. It has a builtin mock 3D stereo effect. a 128voice MIDI  wavetable. and it can sample at up to 48khz in 16bit stereo. and thats  about all there is to it. Whilst it doesnt do anything wrong in itself  .its plugandplay. so if youre using Windows it should work out of the  box.. the Soundblaster Live isnt much more expensive. and offers  environmental audio.If you only dabble with music and dont play many  new games its a perfectly adequate solution. however.,3,0,537

A3CDFFWIDN60NU,0,I ordered one of these in a moment of madness and then spent the next couple of days thinking how could I have just spent 800 quid on a glorified CDplayer.Now Im really glad I have it  it was purchased mainly for my  girlfriend who travels alot. She really likes being able to watch a  favourite film in a hotel thousands of miles from home or while waiting in  the departure lounge when your plane has been delayed  again !The  display is better than my laptop and you dont have to wait 3 minutes for  it to boot. Sound isnt bad. build quality is excellent.Definitely 5  stars for me.,5,1,585
A3CE53O71ATBMM,33,I didnt expect high quality. but I never expected what I received ethier. the pictures were terrible. Im suprised Amazon even sells this product and that Agfa would allow this product on the market. This camera wouldnt be a  good deal if they gave it away! Im a loyal Amazon shopper. and will  continue to shop with them. this is the frist time I have purchase anything  bad from them and hopefuly the last.,1,0,407

Its  quality is GREAT. can also get mp3s off any computer with a sound card.  and it has unlimited space.each cd cost 1 to 2 dollars.

A3CFH7IL0GL187,1112,They are simple and easy to use.  The eight inch length will wrap around a fairly large bundle.  I bought  them to use on earbud cables and charger cables for which I trim them to about 3 inches in length.,4,1,205
A3CFOKNN7DHY1V,0,When I first purchased this I didnt think I would use it but now that I am out in areas with no power. I just plug this in and it powers my scope using a remote power supply. Definitely a needed item.,5,1,200
A3CG1MWBNDUTWY,11,I have two Mac Pro desktops that need to be secured per company security policy.  I got a very good price for the item.  It took all but 2 minutes to install.  Both the monitor and the computer are looped together.  The cable also prevents unauthorized access to the inside of the Mac Pro.,4,1,289
A3CG4T0PDY5A2A,11,This keyboard cover fits on my Levovo Thinkpad x220 tablet great  Im typing on it now.However. the system for choosing a color is difficult. I asked a question above for them to send a black cover to match the rest of my laptop. but received a white one that clashes with the rest of my laptop without them asking me if this substitution was okay. So. dont be set on getting a particular color!Update. After 2 days of use. my keyboard cover become too loose and no longer stuck to my keys. and I have thrown it away.,1,0,516
A3CGQUBQ7PPEKL,0,I purchased this unit and went to install it on my roof.  I started to get fairly good reception. but then as I was tacking the unit to the roof the connector came apart.  I notice someone else here said the same thing.  There is really no way to fix it. and I cannot believe how poorly built it is.  Im going to look at a different brand next time around.  What a waste of money...,1,0,382
A3CHOX3TSHFW1E,11,Why do I have to wait so long to get my package no one does not write me to tell me the statist on the deliver I would not even rate it one star of they had poor that is what I would report,1,0,189
A3CHS8XWR0V9VQ,13,I just bought a very lightly used Nook. and so far Im liking it! I dont have many complaints at all except for maybe the slight lag it has. but other than that it was definitely worth the buy!,4,1,192
A3CJ36HJ2B3D1E,11,I dont have much to say. So far it worked perfectly. Its important to have more memory due the size of the applications we found for the smartphone today.  It works perfectly with Samsung S4.,5,0,191
A3CJAU7JVSPAYU,12,Ive had no trouble with this machine so far.  Many people have noted the amount of tape that is wasted. but there are ways to minimize that if you are making more than one label at a time.  You can set the margins to narrow or none and then turn off the automatic cutting feature.  Just make a label. print. then make another. print. etc.  You do need to be careful if you take a break because if the machine automatically shuts down it will reset the automatic cutting feature even though it will retain your last label information.  Just be sure to check the auto cut option before you print and rest it to manual and you should be fine.  Once you have a long string of labels. you can cut them apart with no difficulty there are even dots to help you get the cut straight.,4,1,775
A3CJFSCTJZX567,1515,The technical data states that this camera is compatible with mac os 7.1 or later. My I mac uses the os 8.1 so. being the idiot that I am. I assumed that this camera would be compatible with my I mac. GUESS  AGAIN!  The only place in the entire world where you will  find the phrase u0026quotthis camera will not work with I macu0026quot is inside  of the installation manual that comes with the camera that you just shelled  out 300 bucks for .,1,0,445

A3CJVHTGVVPH09,2032,I purchased the VTech phone partly because of the ability to use a headset with it. which is very convenient since I do a lot of working from hom. However. I used this headset once before the microphone broke away from the earpiece where it swivels. The sound quality in the earpiece is poor. with noisy amradioquality sound. The phone itself is great. but I plan to replace this headset with one from another manufacturer.,2,0,423

A3CLJ4SU3MDJH1,0,The country of origin originally turned me off from this product.  I purchased 4 of them for use in a  surefire  type LED flashlight.  My set was purchased with a 110 volt recharging station that holds 2 batteries at a time. It works well.  These batteries will work at almost 100% capacity .flashlight brightness. up until they are done. but then die out quickly.  I have also used them in a EO Tech gun sight.  The fit was a little snug. but there was no other problems and I found the battery life to be comparable to a nonrechargable 123a battery.  The product that was delivered was just as described.  Easy Transaction through Paypal. I would purchase from this seller again.,5,1,681
A3CMBXCF28QXEL,12,I purchased this item for my cousin for Christmas.  I stuck with Nook cause he already had the BN account with books in it.  I should have went with a Kindle Fire.  Wanted him to be able to watch movies on it during plane rides and such.  Doesnt seem to be an option without a platform like Netflix.  Netflix has the worst selection of streaming movies.  They should make it free to watch that crap.  Bought myself the Kindle Fire HD.  We certainly learn from our mistakes!,2,0,473
A3CNDRH51Y9HE2,11,did the same things to my garmin as has happened to many others.does not charge unit.actually discharges unit. in my opinion it actually messed up my garmin enough that i needed to contact the garmin help site.they said.amongst other things. there is no real need to charge it if you use your other supplied power cables. purchased this charger for my daughters garmin also and she had almost the exact problems i had.,1,0,418

A3COBPHKWSX1L5,22,VERY VERY CHEAP.BOTH WERE BROKE COULD FIX ONE.I never receive any correspondence from a bad reviewed item.That is why I hate to review,1,0,134
A3CPH0KFMFEIFF,0,Its a great cover. even better than I expected. It comes with two magnets. one on the front. other on the back side.It gives the chance to  lock  the cover on the front when not in use or in the back. when reading.The plastic clips holding the reader fit strongly and the nooks fits steadly. I hope these latches wont break easily because that would render the cover totally useless. since there are only two. Maybe a third or fourth latch would be a great idea. just in case.The back powerunlock button on the nook. can be pushed by pushing the logo on the back of the cover and the reader itself. On the inside of the cover. that button has a round naillike head. I hop it doesnt mark or scratches the nook button on the long term.Too bad I bought it for USD7 more than now. since the price dropped to USD10 recently.,4,1,819
A3CPRW6WRDRN56,0,As described. However. I should have paid attention to the length of the cords. 3 cords have limmeted reach. Works good though and seems to be of good quality.,4,1,159
A3CQ0MLOP8Q3DO,1,I had a problem with mine under a year after purchase. It was a problem with the power unit. Luckily I was still under warranty and got it fixed.

A3CUK87U0LV5RM,11,This is a well made product for the price. The installation was simple but mounting the actual TV wasnt. You have to lift and hold the TV up so as to align the holes for the screws. An extra person was needed. Once up. the Tv leans to the left. The mount was installed level and the first arm is level but second arm is not. However. it fits my needs and for the price I am satisfied.,4,1,384
A3CVDLDZEYKYZ1,0,but it will serve the purpose of replacing paperbacks for my son who is in the military. Convenient sized. easy to use after the software issue was resolved.

A3CVU3DCLTCR78,0,This TV is great in every aspect except video games.Playstation looks horrendous on it.  every single jagged edge shows upand makes u want to .....

A3CXOL9MBOOHMU,44,I have just had my second complete Zip 100 drive failure in 3 years.  Both Zip drives failed to work and would no longer read my disks.  As a result I now have several disks with documents and family photos which I cannot view.  My Zip days are over.  Further. I had many problems getting promised rebates from the company.  I would steer away from the Zip and look for a more reliable product.,1,0,394
A3CY5WUNVMOZCL,1115,My story is just as others have mentioned. I have always had good luck with Sony products but this one is junk. I was a little bit luckier as mine has lasted almost 2 years. The player just stopped working with the C13.00 error and now wont read a single disc. I am not going to even bother contacting Sony as others say it wont do any good. Do not buy this product!,1,0,366
A3CYWTPEC9I7X,66,This surge protector did exactly what it was suppose to do. save my laptop from getting fried. There was a power surge in my apartment building and a few unfortunate people had their laptops damaged but not mine! The APC absorbed the surge and got fried instead of my USD3.000 laptop becoming a paper weight. I immediately bought another APC surge and I never plug in my laptop without it. The green indicator light lets you know the APC is up and running. 5 stars all the way. Its that simple. I dont know what some of the other reviews are talking about. they must be confused.,5,1,579
A3CZ59Z2OOETP,44,First. the service was amazing. I order the Moleskine Kindle cover and 3 or 4 days later it arrived in my home... in Spain! While the shipping was expensive .very.. it was well worth the experience. About the product. if you like Moleskine this cover will not let you down. perfect craftmanship and the quality and allure you would expect. The downside. for my taste. it is too large and bulky. they included a notepad that I think is not necessary which adds in weight and volume. Summary. if youre looking for a cover that is stylish. intellectuallooking and practical. the Moleskine will serve the first 2 purposes. Im still in the market for one that fits the bill entirely .but I kept this one..,4,1,700

A3D1YKQZN1YZXM,0,I bought 4 of these for my test equipment  they got the job done. Though the screw on one of these did snap under medium torque... the other 3 adaptors were fine under the same torque. However. on a different one of these adaptors. I had to u00268220open upu00268221 one of the pin holes slightly before it would accept my male cable. I would probably buy again.,4,1,362

A3D296RVX0JVKB,0,this little gizmo works fine for most phones but it DOES NOT work with phones with caller ID.  Keep that in mind when youre considering a purchase.  Works great with the others.  Overall a nifty little device.,3,0,209
A3D2K4VTDZVBRZ,2122,Im new to using computer networks. and I have to say that this card DOES  it all. for less than the cost of a USBtoETHERNET adapter. and can run at  100mbps.I was not sure which brand to buy but the Fact that the Netgear  was in stock and the Linksys was not made me choose Netgear. and I am so  glad I have!  This works good on my cable modem and my uncles!  The card  works in My Sony PCGXS and other laptops I have tried it in!This is a  great find!,5,1,452
A3D37SX2JYWQAD,55,I got this wall mount for my 39   LED HDTV. The mount  fits well and is sturdy. Good price too.,4,1,95
A3D3R2HDNK6K9K,11,Opened the box and got a bum card. The seller refunded it right away. so I wont knock them too hard. I think that they were a bit confused when they created this ad. as the ETrex Vista HCX is not made by LG. nor is it a phone .still as of 10612.. You dont need custom formatting. either. Kind of makes you wonder what exactly they were trying to sell.All you need is a standard MicroSDHC card .Default is FAT32 formatting.that you can pick up anywhere for less than or equal to the cost of this purchase with shipping. There is some debate on the Garmin forums as to what is the maximum expandable memory for a Garmin GPS. with some agreement as to the max file size .4GB. and maximum number of map segments .2025.. I went with the 8GB just in case the card had some space unavailable .which most often do.. and it held all of Topo 24k West on it without any problems .about 12hr upload to GPS..I would imagine. if I didnt receive a bum card. this would have worked just fine for my purposes.I wouldnt go to a larger card until Garmin has it in writing that handheld GPSs can handle it.,3,0,1086
A3D3SH7R24HKXX,0,The only reason to buy this over priced junk is if you want fix the main design defect of the Palm V. it turns itself on if you push any of the 4 buttons on the bottom of the Palm.If you buy this case. cut off the  back. and drill 4 holes thru the front then you can a. hot sync b. keep  your V in a pocket without it turning on and draining the battery.Id  say you should save your money,1,0,388
A3D3YEL76OFXER,712,Took camera to Vegas and to the grand canyon. This camera has the most amazing zoom Ive ever seen  for the price. Rivels those network cameras that are used for the NFL games. Another great feature is I can .with the  optional IR light. take pictures in total darkness for up to 100 feet. Sony  has outdone itself on this product.,5,1,330
A3D40SYIUEMN75,44,Would have been great if the product worked. unfortunately it does not work with my iPod Touch 3G.,1,0,98
A3D43KVQ5BIVXT,44,I am a first time owner of the Palm IIIx and I am currently searching for an alternative.  I received my Palm IIIx as a gift about 7 months ago. and I have lost all of the data in my organizer 8 times.  I am an active  professional in the television industry and I travel to remote parts of the  world for weeks at a time.  I have been away from my computer .to HotSync  and restore the data. all but one time and have been left without vital  professional and personal contacts as well as lost all new contacts and  production memos and notes.  I have determined the cause of the failure.  If you own a Palm IIIx and have it with you. follow along with me.  Locate  the battery compartment on the back of the unit.  Open it up and look at  the way the compartment is designed to have the batteries installed.  The  top AAA battery slot is designed such that the positive end of the battery  .the one with the bump. must maintain contact with a wire coil.  What  happens is this.  Lets say you have your Palm IIIx in your purse.  briefcase. backpack. fannypack or WHEREVER.  If you drop your bag. set it  down a little too hard. or even RUN with it. chances are that the contact  coil will slip off of the positive terminal on the battery and youll lose  all of the memory in your organizer.  First and foremost. I CANNOT BELIEVE  that 3Com allowed this product to be released with such an incredibly inept  design flaw.  Second. I cant believe that they didnt install a backup  battery to which the organizer defaults in cases of lost power for ANY  reason .let alone because the inherent design of the product leaves it  prone to losing power and therefore data..  Finally. 3Com Customer Service  has done NOTHING to respond to my repeated attempts to bring this to their  attention and ameliorate the situation.  The Palm IIIx is SUPPOSED to be a  powerful tool for powerful people.  Id be surprised if the execs at 3Com  would utilize their own product.,1,0,1957
A3D59YITKI2Y2E,4450,These work fine and they are a lot cheaper than you would pay retail. plus it may be hard to find short cables like these in a retail store.,4,1,140
A3D5B2CBFNJB0K,0,Im a strong supporter of rechargeable batteries. but at 7.2 Volts. this just doesnt meet my needs.  Devices that use batteries are designed to work across a range of voltages because as the battery is used. the voltage slowly drops until the battery just runs out of juice.  When the dying battery crosses a certain voltage threshold. some devices warn you of a low battery.  This is a good thing. because you dont want. say. your smoke alarm to need to go onto backup battery power and not have the juice it needs.  The problem here is that the devices I use seem to cross the low battery voltage threshold somewhere around 7.0 volts.  That is to say. I put a fully charged battery in there and before I know it .about 1 week or 2.. the low battery light comes on in my answering machine or the smoke alarm starts doing its low battery beeping thing.  Nope. this is no good.  I suggest you steer clear of Energizer and go for another brand that has an 8.4 nominal voltage .or better yet 9.6 if that extra .6V isnt going to harm your deviceNiMH cells go in increments of 1.2 V so as far as I know there is no way to get a 9.0 V battery..Sure this will work in many devices. but I really dont see why Energizer opted to go for a 7.2V battery instead of 8.4V other than to save a small amount of money.  That seems like a very offbrand sort of thing to do.  1 star only from me.,1,0,1376
A3D5PT3KFH6WA6,1821,I ordered this sd card about a month ago. and it worked fine until recently. Now I get an error message stating that the sd card was  unexpectedly removed  when it clearly has not been removed. and my phone does a sd card scan every 15 minutes or so.. pretty annoying. This usually happens first thing in the morning after my phone has been sitting idle for hours while Ive slept. Im attempting to get a replacement as I speak.,2,0,427
A3D6KFKN4J5ULE,0,What you gain in u0026quotcoolu0026quot features like LCD touchscreen and computer interfacing. you lose in basic usability and functionality.  Think about the features you most commonly use on your remote control they  should be instantly accessible.  With this remote. you need to navigate  through screens before you can control the right device.If youre really  considering a decent programmable. universal remote for the money. I  recommend the Sony AV2000.  This remote has 12 dedicated buttons to quickly  jump from one device to another.  It also has dedicated Channel + and  Volume + control buttons the Channel conveniently changes to the  trackchapter skip + function when you choose DVD or CD.The most  serious shortcoming of the Sony remote. however. is that the display is  hardly viewable without first activating the backlight.  Nevertheless. give  the Sony a try before you spend twice as much money on this remote.,1,0,932
A3D6KFKN4J5ULE,4043,I have put away my old wallet and converted to this Palm leather case.  My old wallet size is about the same as my Palm Vx in this leather case .but without a lot of junk I used to keep in my old wallet..  The rubber spine that holds the Palm Vx in place seems like it could tear if you frequently  remove the unit from the case.  I just leave it in the case and fold the  flaps back for hotsyncing.TIP.  I find that its best to slide the Palm  Vx in the case so that the screen faces the flap without the card holders.  If you put it in the way shown in the picture. your screen may get  scratched from any credit cards you might have in the holders.I wish  they put a transparent ID card holder in this case.  Thats one thing I  miss.  It would also be nice if they had sewn in a springloaded mechanism  that snaps the covers shut or open so that you wouldnt need the leather  strip and loop to keep it closed.Overall. its a nice slim design that  keeps the bulge if your pocket to a minimum.,4,1,994
A3D763KPX99MHB,1361,Update as of 12112013. tried to work with Sabrent re. this drive not working for me  they werent really wanting to investigate the issue. Ive only been able to test this drive with Win7 on my two Lenovo laptops.  Since those configure some sort of internal USB hub. it may simply be that theres not enough power going to the diskette drive.  Regardless. I decided to return the drive and use the drive thats installed in my very old desktop PC. *** End of update ***Contrary to posts on this site from other users. this drive will NOT work on Win7 Pro 64bit .I get locked up until I unplug the USB cable.. it does NOT support the low density 720KB diskettes. and it caches the contents of a diskette .unless this is a tricky internal Windows feature. so that. when you pop in a different diskette. the drive will continue to show the contents of the previous diskette when you request a directory listing .every once in a while this does NOT happen  cant tell why..  I have to disconnect the drive and plug it back in to see the true contents of the new diskette.  I readwrote about 40 diskettes on Win XP with only a few problemsdelaysfailures once I was clear on the above issues.  I will return this unit and try one more time with another brand that claims to support my Win7 platform.,2,0,1289
A3D8NXND1ALT91,0,I needed a wall mount that would allow my 46  screen to be my computers display and my TV. The screen is a couple inches from the wall right now. and when Im ready to watch TV. I pull it out about two feet. move back to my recliner. and watch TV. The mounts movement isnt real fluid. but it works. It doesnt tilt up or down. but I dont really need it to. At USD30. it was a much cheaper option than I could find elsewhere.,4,1,422
A3D8VXLAZGTIH,0,Not one single review here is about the actual item for sale. When I clicked on the product reviews for this item.  The item is the Targus PA460U DEFCON Authenticator  Black .Electronics. Which in fact has nothing to do with combination locks. cable locks. Or for that matter any kind of locking device other than a programed security device which locks down your computer so no one can enter your files without you being present. Unless of course they have the same finger print as you. It can also work for more than on computer at a time if for save you have two linked together in your network and prefer you children .example. or whomever to have acess to your computer when you are not present. All I can say is that mine works great and I very happy I have one.,5,1,768

A3DB20QDGHTH00,56,DO NOT buy this product!!! I have purchased a nook simple touch and it is awful!!! The reason is there is not a brightness setting. On a scale of brightness 1 meaning pitch black and 10 meaning very bright it would be a 3 meaning dull. This means people that has bad eye sight or has seeing trouble will have a hard time seeing the screen. With light the screen is dull and without light the screen is pitch black! They make attachable lights for them but what is the point!!! You should just buy the newer ones. Now I am stuck with this nook that is useless.,1,0,559

A3DDWOPNS26TPI,17,Ive been using this trackball for well over a year now and I have to say. next to my Microsoft contoured keyboard. its the best u0026quotupgradeu0026quot Ive made to my computer.  It does take some getting used to and it does lack some features like the middle scrolling wheel and the like but Im willing to give those up for the confort and ease of use of this mouse.Once you get used to it. this trackball just u0026quotfeelsu0026quot right under your hand and you have maximum control from just twitching your index and middle finger.  I wouldnt suggest playing any video games with this but for common everyday use. youll never go back to a standard mouse again.The only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars is that. unfortunately. its kind of a pain to clean.  Because its not an optical mouse. you need to. on occasion. pop the ball out and clean the rollers and the teeny little red beads that hold the ball in place....  If you have extremely dry hands. I guess its not that big of a deal but cleaning the gunk out CAN be an excersize in a bit of frustration.  Essentially. youll get to the point where youll never get it completely clean.  Just clean enough....But that complaint aside. this really is a great trackball. and though theres a holy war between the users of this type of trackball vs. the logitech type with the little ball on the thumb. in my opinion. after using both. this give you the maximum in control and confort for a really good price.  If youre looking to get rid of that clunky mouse. at least give this one a chance.  You just might like it.,4,1,1573
A3DFYO2BQKH67T,88,I love gadgets.  My Palm Vx became a constant companion and vital part of my wardrobe. and the modem follows close behind.  On business trips or any other time Im on the road. it has served me very well.  The ability to keep up to date on email. news. and HotSync stuff while on the road. combined with a prepaid phone card. means that Ill never need to lug around a giant laptop!  Woohoo! .....,5,1,395
A3DFYO2BQKH67T,44,This product has turned my Palm Vx from a PDA into a laptop replacement.  I use it to type notes. write email. and pretty much everything else that requires data entry.  The stylus is still necessary for many applications. but Ive gotten used to it.As other reviewers have noted. there are a few quirks to work around. but they havent seemed that serious to me.  You get used to them. and the added convenience of the keyboard definitely outweighs the oddities that come from using it.,5,1,485
A3DGRKB7MHRC2E,33,I bought Defcon CL about a year ago. The lock suddenly changed the combination code that I reset once on its own.I think it is because of the failure of its mechanical design. which means that the failure will certainly happen to every user at some point. Just imagine if your precious laptop were locked out when you desperately need it in some other places. I think the company should recall this product right now.,1,0,417
A3DGRV0O633EUY,22,This product is extremely disappointing precisely because one would expect so much better from a brand like Moleskine. I absolutely love the idea and the design. but the product _just didnt work_. Right out of the packaging. it would only light when connected via USB. Doesnt seem to be anything I can do to fix it. so nows its just a ridiculously expensive bookmark.Honestly. I like the idea so much that Im really. really tempted to buy another one and hope it works. but the large number of negative reviews here has convinced me that they just really messed this one up buying another one is very likely to just double my disappointment and waster more money. Again. very disappointing. I hope someone at Moleskine reads this review page.,1,0,742
A3DH74L21G9QFJ,23,Having spent 2 hours with the Magellan 315 on a camping weekend in Arizonas mountains. I can say that the unit is all thats advertised. The manual is cryptic. but once you get used to the customizing menus and 9 available navigation screens. the rest is pretty intuitive. I was able to create a waypoint. walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet. It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest. It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint .with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website.! As long as you keep moving. the compass feature is quite good. It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.Nice screen. plenty of options and quite accurate. When used in your car. it tracks your speed to .1 mph. with updates given each second.  If you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover. this is a nice addition. I suspect on an open lake. this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots.,4,1,1099
A3DHY56NRIV0P6,33,This adapter only accept type I compactflash card. i.e. those flash memory card It cant fit type II card. such as microdrive. and some CFII modems. The reason is the CompactFlash Type II card .or so called CompatctFlash+. CFII. is slightly thicker than the CompactFlash Type I card.So if you are looking for a CompactFlash type II adapter. keep looking.,2,0,353
A3DI3G26LDF9JE,2535,Ive had this keyboard for about a year and use it for at least 8 hours a day while at work.  Im going to buy another one for home use too.  I was having trouble with carpal tunnel. which was my primary reason for buying the keyboard.  After about 6 weeks of using this keyboard I had fewer problems with my wrists.  I havent escaped it completely. but as a programmer that is something that will probably hang around for life.Getting to know the repositioning of the keys was less agrivating than I thought it would be and I can still use both a straight keyboard and the ergonomic ones with very little difficulty when switching from on PC to the other.Hooking it up was literally just unplugging the old keyboard and plugging this one in.  After a year Ive had no trouble with it.If you type a lot. I would pick one of these up.,4,1,830
A3DIPLAN7A2WXG,33,Did not work too well with my other television that could not play VHS tapes,3,0,76
A3DIXHIECTEKV2,4,TV plate that attaches to TV mount will not fit my TV. I was buying this as a replacement mount since I was moving the TV into the bedroom and needed a tilting mount. Possibly shame on me for having a generic made tv and not knowing the exact VESA mounting pattern but I have used the same TV with another universal mount with no issues. Problem was that where my mounting holes in the TV were. I would have almost had to drill a home made hole in the metal to accomodate the tv.  I needed a hole exactly in the middle of where the mount curves inward.If this mount would have worked. I would have given it 4 stars.  Seems to be reasonably well made for the price with a heavy metal. Definitely much better quality from the speaker mounts I bought from the same manufacturer.  The only negative I saw what the tilt motion.  Instructions make it seem like the tilt is accomplished where the tv meets the mount.  This is in fact not true.  You have to loosen a bolt near where the mount holds to the wall and position the mount up and down on a curved insert.  So if installing. be aware that if you need the tilt to arrange it before you mount.If I were actually able to make it as far as mounting to the wall. then that would have been easy.  Just make sure you have a high powered drill to make it through the stud.,2,0,1316
A3DJ8DG0WPNXQA,11,This is the worst headset I have ever owned. I bought so many of them over the years I dont remember anymore how many went bad. At least 10. The reason I keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets dont work well with a Uniden cordless phone. Uniden requires a specific impedance. otherwise voice quality is not good.Calling Uniden is worthless. They are of no help.I actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the 2.5mm plug.Im not buying anymore Uniden phones or headsets.,1,0,581
A3DJ8WBDMKT3H0,0,Terrible! Came in at a decent time. and seller gave me a quick and easy refund. But the product itself sucked. Was damaged. did not work. read all my files. then didnt. when I put the card in a few times it said SD damaged. Terrible terrible!!!!,1,0,245
A3DJAYQMXLZUA4,55,Im writing this with a little sadness because i really do love my Rio player and it has given me many hours of happiness when i otherwise would have been bored on the treadmill. Still. if I had it to do over again I would buy a different player because I have had no end of problems. Both Mac and PC versions of the software are buggy and there are no fewer than three different customer support departments .one for the player and two for the software.. each of which are very sorry. but another department has to handle my problem. Ive given up on them u0026amp will never buy another Diamond product again.,2,0,609
A3DKDEN5QG9CBL,1011,I bought OfficeConnect for my small business and was truely amazed at this  hubs awesome performance. Its capable of a fast connectivity solution of  10100. The installation was so simple. With this piece of hardware I now  have a office with 6 computers fully networked .file shareing and all. and  Im thinking about purchasing another. I would highly recommend this unit  to anyone who is serious about networking a small office.,5,1,431
A3DKP8M0GSP8UK,22,First of all. this product charges my Garmin 1450 very slowly. I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge it also takes this long to charge the device. The car charger will charge the 1450 fully in about 1 hour. Waste of my money.,1,0,328

A3DLZ57U7AT6EJ,0,I wrote a review about this system a while back. and I explained that I didnt like it. Now. I have even MORE complaints.I have had my speakers for 1 12 years. I have returned them four times. until last week. I have now thrown my system away. I am through with Lansing. The four times that I brought them back. I had the same problem every time. My amplifier on my rear speakers blew out every single time. My last set. my fourth set. died on me last week. I have had quite enough of this horrible service. If you want GOOD speakers. I suggest looking elsewhere. These speakers are for toddlers that like their products breaking on them every 4 months. I am goin for the klipsch bad boys. Those things pack 500w sound and have a dedicated center channel. Goodbye u0026quotMr. Unreliableu0026quot of Altec Lansing. I am goin for the big boy speakers over at klipsch. =.,1,0,868
A3DM8NDY4EIUP1,19,It seems to be a limited device. but it has potential  I think a good price it new should be about USD55.00. I have one as a backup to my kindle P.W there are two pros .the SD card slot and it can be rooted. but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted. Very very limited web browser no Facebook or anything useful. the browser on the the paperwhite is much better. It is a pretty well made device.It is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite.,3,0,460
A3DMB52EFM59Q0,11,My Nook arrived faster than I expected. in perfect condition.  No issues to report. but I definitely get the feeling that communication would be good if I had to contact the seller.  Would definitely buy from this seller again.  Thanks!!,5,1,237
A3DNG54DMW2G88,12,Nice charger... Needed a second charger to keep on desk and one that I carry with me.  I have several cameras and each has its own... This way I never need to worry if I have it available.  Its always in my camera bag... just grap and go. Perfect... does the job well.,5,1,268
A3DOFGA6OC9GN3,44,Ive had it for almost a year now and it works. it does make some noise but because its small. Overall it works with my mac and also my pc.,4,1,138
A3DOZLP11R7RRT,0,This DVD Player is a descent Player for the money. However it does have several drawbacks. 1u0026gt Any DVD that has any sort of multitrack contiguous playback will not play either at all or it will skip all over the place.  .Some movies with this problem are The Matrix. The Abyss. Alien. and  several others that have multiple editions coinciding together..  There is  no statement on the DVD movie itself to warn you of this problem.  Be  warned that most retail sales store will NOT take back any movies for this  problem. if they are open. 2u0026gt DVD Player has no optical output .Minor  problem. if you are looking for the top of the line.,3,0,647
A3DPEJXP7AUYGG,55,Most of the reviews are at least ten years old on this.... Bought this used and abused receiver from GoodWill for just over five bucks! Normally I would leave something like this alone but I have been always intrigued by this little receiver. First and foremost it is a cheap Chinese radio of questionable quality control. second that it has few features and mediocre sound on AM and more so on FM. thirdly I can make it better and as a hobbyist I can do this as the price is right! Im going to add SSB reception. preamp and external antenna jack.... That should give it a few more stars!,3,0,588
A3DPP7Y1JULOVW,22,Microsoft stepped into the hardware market quite some time ago. and now has a lineup of input devices  one of which is the Intellimouse. I purchased my Intellimouse when it was a brand new item from Microsoft. and since then it has performed wonderfully for me.The software included allows customization of the wheel usage. pointer speed. and the three buttons. plus an array of other miscellaneous functions. A cute feature in the Intellimouse software is an odometer. which measures how many feet the wheel of the mouse is turnedThe mouse is set up like any other twobutton mouse. except with a wheel in between the left and right buttons. The wheel serves as an interface for scrolling a document or any other open window without moving the mouse to the scrollbar. The software also allows for the wheel to be setup to zoom in on documents.The three buttons. two of which are obvious. function just like any other three button mouse. The third button which is actuated by pushing down on the wheel can do many different things. such as close an application  this too is customizable in the software.My Intellimouse continues to perform. although the wheel has become a bit slippery and the mouse has become less responsive. I clean the mouse every few months. and this remedies the problems for the most part. but they are to be expected with age.Overall. the mouse is a great product. although now there is an optical version that uses a laser instead of a trackball. This laser makes the mouse extremely responsive in comparison to a mouse wit the classic ball in it.,4,1,1572
A3DPUYA1O34ZLY,22,I was so happy with this.  Just plug it in to your computer and phone. choose pc on your phone and you are charging your phone and transferring files at the same time.  Just what I wanted!,5,0,188
A3DQFSMF4BSB0J,13,I was not impressed the grey skills to light you cannot see the screen in low light. I feel that Ive wasted my money,1,0,116
A3DR2VZACXHRIZ,0,If youre an audiophile. you know from the price tag that you should look elsewhere. But if youre a slightlymorethancasual user. this a great set. The sound is immensely better than those cheap little speakers that came with your PC. The tweeters perform quite nicely. and the subwoofer does its job well. At this price. its a steal.A few niggling issues. It would be nice to have the volume control on the regular speakers as opposed to the subwoofer. or at least the headphone jack. I find myself adjusting the volume with my toe and never plugging in headphones.But other than that. this is a highly serviceable system that should serve your gamingmusic listening needs quite well. unless you are an audiophile or need substantially improved performance. Im not and I dont. and I think that most home users are in the same boat.,4,1,830
A3DRGKHGONYQ5E,1313,The cord is somewhat thick and heavy. This makes it hard to loop it through some smaller spaces. However. it also definitely means it requires more time for someone to cut the cord and steal your laptop. This works well with MacBook Pro computers Ive used .multiple 20072012 models.. Overall. a great product I rely on regularly.,4,1,329
A3DRLSIF65O622,0,Bought a Nook Simple Touch to use while traveling. After about 60 days. it locked up in sleep mode. and wouldnt respond to the Quick Nav Button nor the On  Off Button. Customer Service says its because I left it on the charger for more than 4 hours.So now Im out about USD100 .+ the cost of the books I downloaded. for an Ereader that doesnt work. Not happy with the product or the support.Do not recommend.,1,0,407
A3DS2C8N1FBESO,0,bought because of Moleskine reputation ...big mistake... the ipad frame is too thick and  prvents gitting the homebutton quickly... thin straps for ipad and a place to store pen or stylus... paper pad replacement info?booo!,1,0,223
A3DS8DYCEK5RC7,11,The SC 340 works as advertised.  It is very easy to set up and use.  However. it did not control the onscreen menus on a RCA Satellite box. although it can turn the device on and off. change volume. channels . etc.  The bulletin board at the Jensen web site does acknowledge this. but the information is buried in the customer bulletin board.,4,1,342
A3DS8GDA0T296Q,11,This product is listed under the wrong title. It should be listed as  honestech VHS to DVD 3.0 SE.  This product does not work. The product website doesnt even list this version of the product amongst its legacy products. Why is Amazon listing a product that has no support and doesnt work?,1,0,290
A3DUH4DFZR3YEW,33,They work only marginally sound quality combined with a Motorola Radio is poor an unusable in my application .Motorcycle. above 45 MPH.,2,0,135
A3DV5NFLZXOPJX,0,The Kodak DC240 is great.  The menu and features on the camera itself are very easy to use. and there are some added features that i really like.  The lcd screen can be turned on and off to show the picture about to be taken wspecial effects that were set .e.g. black u0026amp white. and has a digital zoom of 2X. which is very neat to be able to zoom in on things. getting two times closer than with the naked eye.  The camera has video output. which i havnt gotten working yet. dc output. which i havnt gotten working yet either. i think it takes a special dc cord...  and aside from those two the other main flaw is the cord to connect wthe computer that it comes with.  When connected the software takes almost a full minute to display 1 picture for editing etc. which is just simply too long.  I have the serial cable which came with it. but i suspect the usb will be much faster. i recommend buying it as an accesory.  Otherwise. the software works great. lets u auto enhance the picture. making it brighter etc. or you can edit it in microsoft paint. cut and paste and do whatever.  very cool.  I would really recommend buying it because if you go all out and spend a thousand dollars on a great 6.we megapixle camera. you will be very disappointed because in 4 months you can get the same camera at USD400... when i buy electronics i go halfway. that is to say i buy a good product that isnt TOP quality. but very affordible.  this camera is great for that reason... the picture quality is just FINE.  i find it better than a non digital camera. and in the pcmac software you can zoom in even more. showing off its digitalness by holding a steady sharpness that is great.  the only difference between this camera and a top quality camera is really. just the amnt of megapixles.  i find this camera to be everything i need and more. even if it has under 1.5 mp!,5,1,1868
A3DV645KQY9AN1,22,this came very fast. Have not had the chance to test it let alone anything else to compare it to. Thus 4 stars,4,1,110
A3DVHV53WXFZGP,1,I am really cheesed off with buying these headphones. the sound quality is terrible and depending on which way you turn your head.  the reception changes and it sounds like a radio which not tuned in properly.  Normally I would not be bothered in writing a review. but this has been such a waste of money.  Take my advice give these a miss.,1,0,340
A3DVMKY2AV9NKF,25,Easy to use and the kids books are enjoyable.  They are adding more apps and books on a regular basis.  I prefer to use this during the day because the lit screen makes it hard to go to bed after reading.  For nighttime reading. I use my Nook touch.,4,1,249
A3DWFK8HTQFYLD,11,At first I was rather skeptical about the kind of bag I would get for only USD32. But I was pleased to find out that it matches well with my laptop and has plenty of pockets for my other stuff like external mouse. cables. CDs. and documents. I would say this is possibly the ultimate carrier bag that you would want to go for. considering its competitive price of USD32.,4,1,370
A3DWXVGOE2XZIQ,22,The great advantage of this bag is that the entire top unzips .its actually a double run zipper which gives you a wide storage space while everything stays in place..  It was great for my movie camera so I got another one for my digital still camera.  I can keep 20 mini CDs plus marking pens. extra battery and charger. and my bulky but essential viewing hood.  When the bag opens you can see everything. place everything. and when it closes everything stays in place.  After a year Ive decided the design is probably the most convienent Ive used in 30 yrs.,5,1,558
A3DX0XTXZTCD6R,23,No more sticky notes. no more paper reminders in my pockets. I use it to keep track of everything. from check book balance to grocery list.  Great product and the memory is more than enough for day to day use. The hard  casing makes it more durable and the size allows it to fit in your shirt  pocket. I recommend it for anyone who wants to really get organized and  never miss an appointment.,5,1,393
A3DX16W5GTC0TL,1216,MGM issued this on laserdisc a few years back in letterbox format. and an audio commentary track with Johnny Whitaker.  It takes them THIS long to get the movie out on DVD. and when they finally do they use a PAN u0026 SCAN transfer. and dont include the commentary track!  Thanks for nothing MGM. time to hunt down that laserdisc.,1,0,331
A3DXCQE2DXWU6S,1518,Yes. 3Com dose not provide XP driver for it. But you can go to ...... to download ViCAM6858.EXE. Actually. This product was manufactured by 3Com under license by Vista Imaging. Vista Imaging provides the driver usable on XP. I tried it. it works well on XP. This is a very good PC camera. you may use it on XP. Because 3Com discontinued it. I rate it 4 starts.,4,1,360
A3DXD7G69BI6CR,1616,The first set of chargers I received. the wall AC charger took forever to charge my phone battery. I plugged my phone in at night at about 30% remaining and in the morning it was only charged to about 70%. The seller send me a new wall adaptor only. The second one did not work at all. No power at all. So I gave up and bought another locally from a store.,2,0,356
A3DXOM79WU8WDQ,0,iTouch Mini Microphone. Eforcity advertises this works it does not. I respect the fact that they sent a replacement.  Also. did not work. I asked for specs and if I needed software to make it work. Downloaded Apple app iRecorder as researched.  Still did ot work.  Some of their reviews posted give glowing success. the great majority of reviews are negative.  I suggested they take this item off their site.It is frustrating to get a product that does not work. Their solution was to reimburse me.OK. but I do not have the product I need. I asked for a replacement of their earbuds with microphone attached. that does work. No response. That would have compensated for the problems I encountered with them.,1,0,707
A3DXUHFK4GTBO3,11,Came without a charge and would not accept a charge. I charged it for 24 hours.I returned the first order and had them replaced. Had the same problems with the second. I dont know if they were out dated or what.,1,0,211

A3E0PHPWXYCAWR,22,We ordered this item because it was cute and because it was inexpensive. We got what we paid for. It was cheaply made and it definitely did not last long. My daughter is careful with her belongings. so I was surprised to see how quickly the plastic cracked. We chose to get her next case a more expensive and sturdy version. Customer service was fine. the item arrived promptly and in good condition.,3,0,400
A3E109FQHJIKDN,0,I bought this speaker system to stream music from my computer to another room.  It took me about 10 minutes to set up and was pretty easy to do.  Instructions arent 100% clear. but read them a couple of times and they start to make sense.  Adjusting the frequency .tuning. on both the transmitter and speaker was pretty easy too.  Speaker works perfectly and Im really happy with the sound quality and range.,4,1,408

A3E3B6V4KLLK3V,0,Received the speakers and set them up.  One speaker worked great. however. the second speaker would not work at all.  Took great pains to ensure I wasnt doing anything wrong.  Contacted Beach Audio. from whom the speakers shipped. and they told me to return them for credit of the speakers price. but not shipping which I can understand.  BUT. I had to pay for the return shipping which was very upsetting.  Beach Audio told me to reorder since they would not REPLACE them and of course the price was higher for the reordered set.  NICE!  Will not do business with Beach Audio again.,1,0,583
A3E3FMR8T3JEWQ,99,it is a good product and indeed it does use good write acceleration rates but the negative about it. is the fact that it just give you 29GB available and not 32 as claimed. still plenty space though.,3,0,199

A3E4B9GZTNAWRG,0,I am very pleased with this radar detector. it very rarely gives false detections.  The only real negative aspect of it is the fact that when the digital voice is inacted. it has poor sound quality.  The microphone sounds  very muffled and can be hard to understand the road hazard or other  direction.  This being my first radar detector .received as a gift. I  didnt get a chance to comparison shop. so Im not sure how this model  compares with others in its class. Overall I am happy with the performance  my Bel Radar Detector.,4,1,531
A3E4UOLTSXVJXR,2329,Overall Im pleased with this case.  I was going back and forth between this one and a real leather red one and when I read a review on the red one about their iPad slipping out of the top and falling thats what made me go with this one. It slides in from the inside so its secure all the way around. The magnetic clasp makes it easy to open.  Good to have the screen protector. Its very slim and not bulky. It props up. And its got a faux fur imprint on it too.  Very chic! If I had one complaint it would be that it had a very strong plastic smell when I unwrapped it. but its fading and Im assuming it will go away after its aired out for a few days.Edited. the cover started coming apart about 6 months after purchase. The vinyl covering over the clasp is cracked and has peeled off in several places. The lining around the edges of the inside that holds the iPad has also almost completely come loose and had to be removed. Also had to buy a silicone sleeve to keep the iPad from sliding out of the cover.  The cover itself that is visible on the outside still looks the same except that it is worn off on the edges. I would expect some of this wear and tear after a few years of strenuous use but not after a few months of very light use.,2,0,1243
A3E4VQ06C4L6DX,0,Does what its supposed to without problems. Canon cable is very expensive  this works fine without the high price tag.,4,1,118
A3E79WZG7GIDAS,0,I bought 2 of these for my van. and they surprisingly hold quite a bit. and do their job. We have them hanging around the head rests. so they arent too appealing to the eye. but its better than having trash everywhere. And. they are easy to empty. We are satisfied and consider it a good purchase.,4,1,297
A3E7PG9CHDBICA,0,After reading other reviews and becoming worried about the cap popping off. Im pleased to say that this has not been an issue with mine.  Its surprisingly handing to have a penstylus combo on hand at all times and the stylus part is very responsive.  I havent had any problems yet with the stylus portion but I am a bit worried that it could pop off as Ive had this problem with other styli.  The tip is a bit softer than other styli Ive had so Ill be watching.  Otherwise though. I love this thing.,5,1,499
A3EA3ML2P9MR7S,0,It is always risky buying a semiexpensive product online. because if you have to return it. it is a lot of workhassle for the amount of money you get back.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!  SPARE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION!  FIrst of all. I didnt even get what I ordered.  I ordered .and payed for. the more expensive CallerID compatible RC930 wireless jack. but they sent me the cheaper. noncaller ID compatible one.  I decided to go ahead and use it and after carefully following the directions and the troublshooting guide IT DIDNT WORK.  Then after calling tech support and CAREFULLY following the automated trouble shooting directions it still didnt work.  So then I called back again and waded thru the automated directions again so I could finally be connected to a live technician. ONLY TO GET A BUSY SIGNAL.  So now I have to go thru the hassle of returning this product to get my USD53.79 back. and I still dont have a phone jack where I wanted one.  Looks like hardwiring a new phone line will be easier.,1,0,1003
A3EA5L86I5P6BS,11,I was buying the microcassettes and Amazon shoved in regular cassettes after I purchased the microcassettes and I bought the regular cassettes by mistake.  I did not want them but they are still in my office.  I will be more careful the next time.  Yes. I would buy some more microcassettes.  I use them but not the regular cassettes.,1,0,334
A3EAS6MRV6YHNZ,3,The tripod is pretty decent for its price. It has everything I expected. It is light. easy to fold and unfold. Ive been using it for a while and found that although it seem fragile. it has not been damaged as yet. The only issue I have with it is that its a bit bulky to carry. But I guess that is expected from a 5 tripod. It comes with a nylon carrying bag that you can sling over your back. The strap is not adjustable though.It does what I want it to do.so Im satisfied.,4,1,474
A3EBJ0F741V6DJ,11,The Nook color is an okay item. It has easy access. but here are the notsogreat facts about it.1. Always has a weird feeling of the screen2. Locks up all the time.,4,1,163
A3EBMFP6R9IM2O,0,and i unfortunately bought them as a final sale.  the sound quality is horrible  everything sounds like its in a tunnel.  im really very disappointed. and even more so that i cant return them and now have to spend additional money on a new pair.  argh.,1,0,252
A3EBY51OFMY9CM,44,I definitely didnt *need* these extra charges. but I do appreciate having them. I now have an extra one at home and one in the car.,4,1,131
A3EC3FDPC7FNL3,11,When I first bought my Palm IIIxe. I didnt think that the styli mattered much. but that was before I had to perform a soft reset. I was lookinf around for a paper clip for hours .. . . maybe not. and when I finally found one. I had a hard time getting it in the hole so that it would touch the reset button.  That is when I deciden to buy a new stylus. When I bought these. I was amazed at how comfortable and easy to use they were. I still cant belief I didnt get a new stylus from the start. Buy it. and you wont choose wrong!IT IS THE BEST!!!,5,1,545
A3EDF1ZHF4OJS6,22,I hooked up my Sony DVPS330 to a JVCRX778V digital receiver .with builtin decoder.. and let me tell you the performance is outstanding.  When hooked up with the Svideo and digital optical audio cables. the sound and picture are stunning.  I blast a movie through the stereo and wonder  what I am going to do with all those VHS movies I have lying around.  The  DVPS330 has great features and the remote is very easy to use.  Access  times on discs are very fast. including bringing up specific chapters.  The  construction of the DVPS330 is very solid.  You will notice that the first  time you open and close the disc tray.  It makes a vaultlike sound when it  closes.  I love that.  All in all. the DVPS330 is a great buy if you have  a receiver with a builtin decoder.  Setup is a cinch.  Just hook up the  video and audio cables and plug it in.  Thats it!  The only drawback I can  see with the DVPS330 is that it lacks a shuttle ring on the unit and  remote.  Other than that. the performance of this unit is amazing.  I  recommend it highly.,5,1,1047
A3EDK4FZWXGRXE,2323,I bought one of these in 1999. through Amazon. and it has been a true performer! When I got assigned to Romania we debated buying a smaller screen multisysten TV .at great cost. or taking our nice. new. 31u0026quot GE .NTSC. set and converting it. I just bought this converter and purchased a Philips VCR locally to act as my cable tuner .PAL.. If you have a TV with audiocomposite video in jacks. this will enable you to convert and view literally any video format with no problem. The image is sharp and clear. and it comes with plug in transformers for both 110V and 220V operation. It can be used with bigscreen TVs of all types. and can output a NTSC or PAL signal for your television. A wonderful alternative to expensive multisystem sets. and as a side benefit you can use it to tranfer tapes from PAL to NTSC and vice versa!,5,1,832
A3EDWQF4B1X5MN,4848,I know this is a good deal at a good price. Now I have the task of figuring out the utilize on the phone ...  hmmmmmmm.wheres a 5yr old when you need one !!! .,4,1,159
A3EE1IHHQ1LGGW,0,I got this charger. but I have a question now. Usually the AA size alkali battery is 1.5V but the NiMh rechargable battery is 1.2V.Can this battery be used on sonething needs AA alkali battery?,4,1,193
A3EE74RQJK5K3W,2,I purchased my camera .display model. when a large chain was relocating to a new store for a very good price.  I had been looking for quite some time and a friend had the FD71 and was very happy with it.  So easy to use a  4th grader could immediately use.  I was not looking for the features that  the FD83 had as I already had a digital video camera.  I really like the  idea of being able to click in a floppy and start shooting and not having  to hook up anything once I get home to start printing out my shots.  The  only disappointment to me is the low resolution.  If you want to print  anything larger than a 4 x 6. you loose the clarity.  On a scale of 1  10.  I would rate the SOny Mavica FD73 a 9,4,1,707
A3EERF1UEPCOEF,2242,I got a pair of these radios for 125 bucks. which is hands down the best deal anywhere. local stores and internet included.  These radios have the standard. 14 channels. 38 subcodes. but they also have a scrambling option  which isnt foolproof. but keeps most people away.  This radio has many  options. you can turn all the beeps on. .talk confirmation tone. button  press beeps. or all of them off or any combination. the lcd display is well  lit. despite what is said at Cobras website from the dirt and road review.  The retractable antennea makes this unit extremely portable. when its  down. the radio is little bigger than a pager.  All in all. the best  radio out there save two or three VERY HIGH PRICED MODELS. .microtalk3.  kenwood. cherokee. each at least 100 a peice..  So. go with these radios  if you want a compact. clear radio with more than the basic features.,4,1,878
A3EF292J9X7DLC,4343,The case is cute and fun. but bulky and after putting the ipad in it its much heavier than other ipad cases.  The ipad slips out if you are not careful.  Have to put a rubber band on the edge of the ipad to help secure it in the case.  Would not purchase again.,2,0,261
A3EFHC536R7MC,0,Floppy Disk Drives are old tech at this point. but if your working with old systems they can be real important. I had to install a old version of windows on a RAID array and a floppy was the only way thatd work properly .slipstreaming the drivers didnt work..So I figured Id get this one via Amazon Prime. easy right?Nope! I got the drive and had a old floppy thatd kept around just for this kind of situation. Plug the drive in. put the disk in and tried to get it to work. Said it was unable to read and needed to format it... ok. sure no problem! Went through the steps to format the drive and got the error  Windows is unable to format the drive . So I tried multiple other format settings. googled. etc. Nothing worked. So I figured the old disk was bad. went and bought a new stack of 10 off amazon again. Get those. try and few of them and no improvement. I stumbled across the manufactures user manual that explains a bunch of real tedious instructions to get it to work. So followed those to a  T  and STILL no luck. I put in a support ticket. but from reading the reviews on heres thats a waste of time.Totally ridiculous... _,1,0,1136
A3EGHJZYR3LDLR,89,Ive had this lock for 6 years. and the combination has been the same since day one.  I received this lock from a previous employer.  And. for the past 2 years. this lock has lived in my backpack. traveling in and out of various airports and hospitals.  Even with extensive use. the rigidity of this lock has not changed.  I have no complaints!  I just hopped on Amazon to buy a second one. and was shocked to see all the negative reviews.  Frankly. if the combination changing by one number .up or down. is the worst complaint. then I see no problems.  Ive had luggage locks change combination after repeated beatings from checking my luggage.  Its par for the course.  ..,5,1,672
A3EGPXPNH0DU76,22,I recently purchased a 140DLX. and I just got my first set of pictures back. I have NO formal photographic training. but I was simply blown away by the quality of the photos I got back. To me. they looked similar to  photos Ive seen from really expensive. complicated cameras with all those  removable lenses.I wanted to buy an APS camera. because of the  simplicity of loading film. If this is a concern of yours. buy this camera.  Its ridiculously easy. APS film shots tend to look grainy. because the  negative is smaller than 35mm. so theres another plus.To me. the  coolest feature was spot metering. You can get some really incredible color  and life in your photos. and you can also simulate u0026quotfocusingu0026quot on  one object. while having other objects in the scene out of focus.I  suggest reading the entire manual. then blow a test roll .find a willing  sibling. like I did. on the camera with different camera settings and  lighting conditions so you can see what it will do when you really need it.  And make SURE to try spot metering on things in the foreground and  background so you get the concept. Youll be really impressed with this  camera! Adam,5,1,1172

A3EI92V6M47N55,23,I had to print inserts for about 100 CDs that would be used for wedding favors. and I did not think it would be a simple task at all. I purchased these labels and found it to be quite easy actually. Another reviewer mentioned the poor software that comes with it. However. I did not have a problem with the software at all and actually found it helpful. All our guests actually complimented how professional the CDs looked. My only complaint with the inserts themselves is I think Memorex could have added a few more perforations to make separating them from the rest of the paper easier. It seemed weird that a few logical ones were missing while in other areas the perforations seemed entirely extraneous. Overall though I would recommend these to anyone who needs to make relatively simple CD inserts.,5,1,804
A3EI9TX2A4MUSZ,22,The case looks as described. .Although for better photos. I would go directly to Barnes and Nobles site.. The main visual disparity is the color. In real life. the case is definitely a classic highlighter yellow. but on the screen. the yellow seems a bit more pale and muted. The sleepwake function when you open and close the case works as described.The main thing that made this 4 stars instead of 5 for me is how the case doesnt stay shut. Unlike other smart covers .like for iPads.. this one doesnt have a magnet to keep the case closed. Otherwise. its great. It adds a teeny bit of bulk. but its not offputting. It was also very easy to snap the tablet into the case.,4,1,672
A3EIH3FETBO3Z3,0,Mounted a 42  Vizio.Pros. Mount is sturdy. fit TV. and is a great valueCons. Articulating the mount could be easier. but it really isnt that bad,4,1,144
A3EIMCD47HDQI4,0,First of all. the price for these headphones is pretty hard to complain about. But from a company like Maxell. I was expecting at least a little bit better. even from a USD6 set of headphones. The speakers in the HP200 dont adjust their angle at all to accommodate the listeners ears. so you always feel as if they could just sat a wee bit better when wearing them. They arent uncomfortable to wear. mind you. but they dont appear to give you the optimum angle for listening. As for the sound quality. you can turn up the volume on whatever your listening to without any significant distortion. But you may need to do that to hear most of the full range of your music. These sounded more midrangy to me than balanced theres some bass but not a lot. and likewise with the treble. Vocals and the middle notes of guitars and keyboards are almost too up front through the HP200 as a result. I have a hard time recommending them for music as a result you can certainly use them for that. as long as youre not finicky about what you listen to.,3,0,1037
A3EKEOKDKLZI4M,44,ive been listening to MP3s on my computer since its inception my main purpose of buying a portable player was for my workouts. this is better than a tape and much better than a cd in regards to skipping and overall  freedom.  this little hardware is a big awakening that the future is here.  the sound quality is sufficient. unless you want to be a real tightwad  about it .its better than tape. a smidge less than CD.. my next step is  memory! memory! memory! this is a wonderful product.,4,1,489
A3EKHGKMESXZJM,23,Its just the right size.  It fits in either my left or right hand well .the left a little better..  It is convient to use.  I like skipping past messages easily u0026amp quickly something you couldnt do with a microcassette recorder.  And. it is alot easier to record thoughts during  the commute tofrom work than the memo pads Ive seen that people have  attached to their dashboards.Will it replace a cassette recorder or  microcassette recorder for recording lectures or meetings?  No.  Based on  the design of the product. that was and is not its purpose.A great  product!  I carry it with me everywhere.,5,1,607
A3ELOUOP047KO5,5658,I bought my Rio PMP300 last fall. and its been my primarysource of personal music ever since.  I think MP3s are a great alternative to CDs when used ethically. and the Rio 300 is a fairly inexpensive option.  I must say that the Rio is efficient on batteries. has very good sound with very little distortion .if its distorted. its probably the ripperencoder that made the MP3.. and since its completely electronic with no mechanical parts. it obviously never skips.  I run with mine and use it in the car with a cassette adapter. and I love how light it is.  Despite all these pluses. there are a few things the wary consumer should know...As for mechanics. the Rio 300 has limited onboard memory  I get along fine with the 32 MB. but at times. especially on long trips. I wish I could play more than about 34 of a CD at 128bps .about u0026quotCD qualityu0026quot..  Be ready to shell out more for that flash memory addon.  The case on the Rio 300 is relatively fragile.  Dont count on putting it through a lot of abuse. and be careful with the belt clip. as it may strain the thin plastic   mine cracked. but a little superglue fixed it and its fine now.  The bottom line. if you dont have a lot of money but you want that MP3 player. its a good buy.  As for me. Im about to convert to a minidisc playerrecorder with a USB MP3 adapter.,3,0,1336
A3ELOUOP047KO5,55,My nice dad gave me this card for Christmas. and as soon as I installed it  in my old Pentium 200. I never looked at games quite the same way.  They  look positively astounding!  This card will bring life you didnt even know  existed from old clunkers like mine.  Though varied. the refresh rate is  beautiful on most stuff Ive seen. and I can run games now that I never  thought I would be able to.  Judging by the price. if youre a college kid  like me. its probably a very smart investment if youre looking for an  inexpensive upgrade.  So why do I only give it four stars?  Well. I must be  honest.  The first card I installed was defective.  It accellerated fine  and functioned properly. but it displayed a constant blinking    u0026quotgridu0026quot of pixels on the screen. evenly spaced.  .and I did  install it carefully while properly grounded.  3dfx customer service was  rude to me once out of three times. but otherwise was nice about it. and  the retailer my father bought it from replaced the product without much  trouble.  Drivers were slightly buggy for a while. but they seem to be  fixed now. and its probably safe to say that my mishap doesnt happen to  most people.  All in all. go for it!,4,1,1212

A3EMRBL6P6BOZ,1,I tested the Advent AW770. Advent AW720 and the RCA WHP160 headphones.  The audio quality was comparable on all 3not bad for a .money.set of headphones. but the Advent phones each had drawbacks.  The Advent phones had to be manually tuned to the right frequency.  That was just too big a pain in the xxx for me.  These. the AW720. were so tight on my head that they hurt!  I couldnt find a way to adjust the tension.  Unless you have a really tiny head. dont buy these phones!  I recommend the RCA WHP160 phones in this price range.,1,0,532
A3EMZ433QPZU0O,24,Fine little Velcro ties. The ties lack a tie to the cable .I use them for extension cords.. If they had a small slot to double them back through it in order to fasten them to the cable then I would rate 5 stars.,4,1,211
A3ENUWO1Y2OE7W,0,Pros. Excellent quality. notepad for taking notes. price .vs Amazon covers.Cons. No pen holder. no Kindle sideclips. costly notepad refills. lefthandedAnyone who has ever used a Moleskine product will testify to their impeccable quality and this Kindle DX cover is no exception  great quality material and stitching. plush suede lining. signature notepad paper.Where this case lacks. however. is functionality  it does not utilize the Kindle patentpending sideclips. opting instead for sturdy yet bulky rubberband corners. one of which almost completely conceals the volume control buttons on the top right of the device. Another. in my opinion. tremendous shortcoming is the fact that this cover seems to be designed exclusively for the lefthanded use. The notepad holder is nonreversible. forcing it to be on the left side of your Kindle. so you end up hitting it with your elbow while writing. For some reason Moleskine decided that your Kindle in this case will be a sideaccessory to their tiny notepad.This case comes with two notepads. however they are only a few dozen pages thick. so you run out pretty fast and eachrefill notepadwill set you back about USD10 with shipping. It would be hard to find a generic replacement pad. due to specific size and thickness needed to use with this case.,3,0,1299

A3EPT8ENSU0TU,0,Bought this since it said it was specifically formatted for the Galaxy S4. and for the first 2 months it was working fine.  Bought it to replace a SanDisk 64gb MicroSDHC card that was prone to have problems.After approx 2 months. the card stopped reading in the phone.  I tried other cards and they worked in the phone.  The Kingston MicroSDHC card was dead and will not even read in my laptop or desktop computer. using different SD card readers.  I cant format it. cant even read it in the Disk Management viewer. and cant do anything with the card now.  Thousands of pictures and videos are now lost and that doesnt make me happy at all.  JUNK card.FYI. I put the 64gb SanDisk card back in and thats been working great ever since.,1,0,733
A3EPT9RBIBPL2I,23,I had my cover for over 1 year with zero issues. but recently I forced hinged light in wrong direction and broke the plastic hinge.  I recommend this cover. but just be aware of the need to bend the hinged light in the correct direction.,3,0,237
A3EQ3YQKTNAG3F,1,We ordered this particular AC adapter on the recommendation of two other users.  However. even though it was ordered two weeks prior to our departure for Europe. it did not arrive before we left so we have no experience using it yet.  We got by ok by using older. more cumbersome adapters weve had for years .no USB charger. but were looking forward to traveling to England. Scotland and Paris with this more compact unit.  Amazons writeup did say to allow up to 14 days but were spoiled....products ordered through Amazon have always arrived within days. typically shipping from somewhere in the US.  This charger shipped from Asia....allow plenty of time!,3,0,657
A3EQOEUE1QSGJK,0,I wont actually use them until next August but I like them alot more  than the ones that go over the head.  My only problem is they occasionally fall out of my ear. but when you are wearing them all day. they are less annoying than the other kind.,4,1,247

A3ES51FL3H0QCR,11,This lock is very easy to use. the only two things you need to carry around are the key and the cable itself. Tie your laptop up wherever you go. especially the library! I live on the ground floor. and my desk is right next to the window. So I keep my laptop locked up even when its at home. so that any wouldbe burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook. Although. if he really wanted to. he could probably get a pair of wirecutters powerful enough to cut the cable.All in all. this cable makes me feel secure against casual thieves and I recommend it for all laptop users.,4,1,615

A3EUSH8DPW75LR,11,I purchased this from Amazon 4 years ago and here it is 4 years later and it still works perfectly.  I had to write a review on such a great product.  It is a definite inconvenience when any of your electronic pieces hit the road.  Your television. cd player. receiver. computer. etc.  These are all necessities and if any of them break down they must be replaced immediately regardless of budget.I live in a highrise apartment right in downtown Boston and there is much dust.  When a cd player starts acting up you dont know whats going on at first.  If its dead. its dead.  But if cds are skipping or playing errartically what do you do?  Is it the player itself?  First you clean the cds.  Maybe its a simple problem.  Well. my cd player was having a field day at the time  cds jumping and skipping all over.  I purchased this product. used it correctly and voila  the cd player worked perfectly.  All the problems cleared up.  Now. whenever it starts to skip I know it is from dust or something in the player and it just needs a simple clean.Bottom line. this product is inexpensive and it works to perfection.  I have had it 4 years and it is still going strong.  I highly recommend this product.  Finally. something that actually does what it says it does.,5,1,1262

A3EV430I5VYLDV,4047,I bought these to use them with a desktop PC for watching a video or hearing some music while working. The main reason I got these is the long cable .although most others seem to complain about it.. My PC is placed on the floor .you know  old school huge desktop tower. and all the standard cords are too short if I dont want to bend down.The sound quality is alright to good. but I rate it only three stars for two reasons.a. The volume is on the low side. which doesnt matter at all when used with a stereo. but my PCs onboard sound plug just isnt powerful enough.b. Amazon says that its the open type .which is good. because you can hear what happens in your environment.. However. for these particular phones. your environment can also hear what you are listening to. even. as I pointed out in a.. the volume is relatively low .Lets say it this way. The volume ratio outsideinside is higher than usual for open ear phones.. If I would want my environment to hear what Im hearing. I would use speakers.,3,0,1005
A3EVCDBAN7EUSW,55,I just tried this today. because a few of my tapes display minor tracking issues. and I figure this would knock them out.I couldnt have been more wrong.  I have a Sanyo VHS player.  Nothing particularly out of the ordinary.  I popped this thing in. pushed play .per the instructions.. my machine started grunting. the tv screen turned fuzzier than I had EVER seen it before. then the VHS player shut off altogether.When I turned it back on. the machine spit out the tape.  I tried this 3 times. all with the same result.Now. I cant see anything through the fuzz when I play any of my VHS tapes.  This has rendered my collection completely useless until I get a new VCR.Really pissed.My young daughter watches movies on VHS.  I was trying to improve her experience. not completely eliminate it!!!Stay away from this product. whatever you do!!,1,0,841
A3EWWBEYLPORZ1,0,The HewlettPackard C4438A CDRW discs are the best CDRW discs I have ever spent my money on.  They are very high quality and are made by a good company. HP.  They are also wonderful to make your own custom CDs with.  I  make my own custom CDs with these discs and they sound wonderful on my CD  player.  Another great thing about these HPRW CDs is that they can be  rewritten on many times.  They even come with their own CD Jewel case.The only disadvantage I found with them is that they do not have a high  memory capacity like most other discs.  If you were just looking for  economical discs and feasible alternatives of data storage. I would say  that these are fine. but if you want to put large documents or large  numbers of documents on the discs. you may want to get a larger capacity  disc.  I have also found this product superior compared to other brands of  CDRW discs in almost every aspect except for the smaller memory capacity.,4,1,944

A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,0,CD Changers are getting very hard to find at a good price. I really like this JVC changer. It replaces a three or four year old fairly high end Sony changer that started skipping the first 10 seconds of every disc. The changer is connected to a Yamaha RXV2600 receiver via a fiber optic connector .the same path as the Sony changer.. I was very surprised at how much better CDs sound on this player. Im totaly sold. My guess. you can spend a lot more money. and not be any happier.One downside to this changer. it is tall. But Ill take tall with good sounding solid mechanicals to short and cheap sounding.,5,1,606

A3F2ND7O28ZIX0,7786,These prove that you dont need an inconvenient threepiece computer speaker system to really enjoy the low frequency range.  Labtec achieved such great lowend response without sacrificing very much of the highend.  too.  Thus the sound from these amazing speakers is rich and full.  Their  reproduction of classical music is always balanced and pleasing .although  audiophiles might find the articulation to be slightly imprecise..  These  speakers are most impressive when you turn up the volume on somthing  bassheavy like triphop.  If you live for clear shimmering highs. these  may not be the speakers for you. but if youre looking for a twopiece  system that can be felt through the floor. as well as being capable of  surprising volume without noticable distortion. look no further.,5,1,787

A3F3VH3NTD3H2Y,0,bought the nook in late january 2011. it went bad in mid february. couldnt return it for a refund so only option was to have bu0026n send a used.refurbushed nook.  now i have someone elses junk.  before it went bad. downloading books from bu0026n or other sources was a nightmare.  spent hours on the phone with a very poor tech support at bu0026n.  had to rename files. delete folders in the nook etc.  just a piece of junk.,1,0,425
A3F3Y0TPOTLZ8S,49,I use this camera at work and post the pictures on the companys intranet site. The floppy disks are very convienent for interoffice exchanges. and  it is not difficult to carry around a few extra floppies when youre on the  move and want to take a lot of pictures. I had no trouble at all learning  how to use the camera and had taken a picture. imported it onto my  computer. and posted it on the internet in about 5  10 minutes. It is  pretty durable too  I dropped it off the back of a speeding golf cart and  it was fine afterwards .phew..  However. as time went on. I found the  picture quality average at best. The camera does not take reliable shots.  and the quality can vary from excellent to extremely poor. I know how to  use a camera and how to take what should be a good shot. but too often the  pictures end up fuzzy or overunder exposed. I can get better quality  taking nondigital pictures and scanning them in .although this takes  considerably longer.. Also  the zoom feature is useful. but like many  zooms. does not quite provide a focused shot.My advice. if youre  just starting out and looking for a quick and very easy way to take digital  pictures. this camera is a good choice. If you have any experience with  digital cameras or even a regular 35mm. look to spend a little bit more.  and get a lot more quality for your money. You may lose that 10x zoom and  some of the easytouse features. but I think it is worth the sacrifice.,4,1,1455
A3F435I2FW13VB,4142,I bought this adapter because of concerns over how long it took to download directly fromt the camera.  So far. I have been able to successfully download through the adapter once out of 5+ tries.  Rereading  the instructions. hasnt helped. and Olympus has been less than helpful in  getting it to work as advertised.  You are probably better off with a  direct card reader.,1,0,373
A3F4ZRJDB8Q0R3,1520,I bought this little radio hoping to use it on a cross country trip. and after it arrived i was so disappointed that it had no reception!!!  It went back to Texas...,1,0,165
A3F51860NP4S26,23,Its a nice eReader. and it wont hurt your wallet. It doesnt have much space for anything else but books. so if you plan to not use all the fancy features and apps it has. this ones for you.I got this as a gift for my mom... She doesnt really use it .in fact. she gave it to me!.. but its a really good investment. It is much more convenient than lugging around two to five books of your favorite series. Also. its very convenient to have pretty much your entire library at your fingertips! Its not heavy at all. and it is nicely customizable.The huge downside for me is. this reader cant read any files for comic books. As an avid comic book lover with more than 300 digital comic books. I dont like that one bit. Another downside is. the PDFs arent with the other book files. I happen to have many PDFs I enjoy reading. so thats a bit of an inconvenience for me.I will say this. if you own or are thinking about owning an iPad. do NOT buy this item! iBooks can read ePub and PDF formats. and there are apps you can download for free to read CBR .comic book. files. Or. if you have an iPhone and dont mind reading on that tiny screen. youre good to go!Anyway. overall. this product is sweet. However. if youre more into space and variety. I would get a newer model or even a Kindle.,4,1,1282

A3F6AY4V6548CL,0,Most people have long ago gotten rid of their VCRs.  If youre like me. you didnt throw yours out simply because there was new technology to be had.  Unfortunately. if you keep your VCR youll probably have difficulty doing anything else but taping shows off of your television because there are no new movies being released on this type of medium.  Having said all that. youll most certainly need to clean the heads on the VCR once youve decided to keep it for the long haul and this is the product youll want to use.  The Maxwell VP200 VHS Wet Cleaner cleaned my VCR heads so well. I thought I was viewing a nontaped TV program.  Its certainly worth the money .especially since I have 2 VCRs. and if you run out of the liquid. you can replace it with alcohol.,5,1,759
A3F6DNMUK4IXXZ,2021,This offer from Barnes and Noble was a great deal and an inexpensive entry to the world of eBooks. We later bought a second Nook for my wife as we both love to read.,4,1,165
A3F7FDDLQJGL8G,0,As I have said before. I hate making up words for inanimate inexpensive items like this. .You need to allow customers to skip reviews on these types of items.  To name a few. Toothpaste. batteries.  a cover for a Nook. etc.,3,0,223

A3F8XKWB9AUU3E,11,At first I couldnt decide between a CD burner or an mp3 player.  I chose the latter for its cheaper overall price. skipfree design. and just plain  coolness factor.  However. being new to the mp3 player market. I was unsure  which one to buy.  After days of careful consideration. I narrowed it down  to the Nomad II and the Rio 500.  I finally settled on the Rio 500. and I  feel that I made the best choice.  The factors I weighed heavily were  onboard base memory. features. sound quality. and price.  The Rio. with 64  MB base memory. is one of the highest out there. at least for now.  And  with SmartMedia or Flash cards. you can boost it up to 128 MB.  The Rio  features easy to find and push buttons. bright LCD screen with backlight.  bookmarking. and a handy scroll button that lets you tweak the volume.  equalizer. and choose a song while another is playing.  Theres no radio or  phonebook. but hey. I want my mp3 player to play mp3s. not be a palm  pilot.  Oh. and buy new headphones like all the ones that come bundled  with mp3 players. they stink.  Anyway. this little beauty has everything  youre looking for in a mp3 player. and at the awesome Amazon.com price.  its worth every penny.,5,1,1203

A3FAXGA5GY1I9L,0,I originally purchased the GoPro Hero3 camera at the Apple Store in New Orleans. The shelf beside the camera had PNY class 10 Micro SHDC cards on display. which would push the users to believe they were made for GoPRO.This is what I believed too and the reason I purchased a 32 GB card.In practical use this card caused significant frame drop to the point of making me questioning if the camera was at fault or not.In Houston at the Apple Store in the Galleria  I recognized the same setup. I paid attention to the card specifications on the package . 10 MBs. This explained very clearly the reason of the dropped frames.I hope that the SamDisk card with 30 MBs transfer rate will prevent dropped frames .at HD resolution  48 framess .,5,1,735
A3FB56NOSBIDNG,24,Im really impressed with this product.First. its about half the price of the Palm product .which Ive used. and I like this one better.  I prefer the one piece .non folding. construction  cant put it in your pocket. but easily fits in a briefcase or backpack.  Just feels solid. whereas the folding ones feel flimsy.  Excellent docking base for the Palm. supports it really well.It came with some nice extras I wasnt expecting.  It came with a full functioned Word Processer .complete with Spell check. a thesaurus. capable of saving in .doc format. then loading directly into Word upon HotSync.  If bought by itself. this software is about the same price of the keyboard  here. its a great free bonus.  I also appreciate the fact that you can HotSync directly from the keyboard. something many other models dont do.This is a great keyboard. and truly does make the Palm function more like a minilaptop.  Well worth it.,5,1,918

A3FE2GUBM8JZ3G,11,This is a good little radio for the price. I bought three of em from Amazon and put them in various locations in my office.I bought it because the alarm clock radio I was using couldnt lock into the station I listen to all day. and I was looking for a radio that could. A couple of the reviews here said this one could. so I bought three.This radio. while it does tune in well to a station when youre tuning it. does what pretty much any radio without PLL tuning will doitll tune in well. but when you move it. or move yourself. it drifts. Furthermore. I kept one on my desk. and my various office equipment .printer. monitor. etc.. interfere with the signal....,3,0,662
A3FFVMQJYFKJ1W,44,Ive used one of these mice for years. and except for the occasional cleaning. have never had many issues with it.  Ive been disappointed to find how rare theyve become. Great for both macs and pcs. I would reccomend this for anyone with hand or wrist problems.,4,1,260
A3FFW39219ZAKC,0,Theres a reason the VCR is now dead as a media player. The tape I got wouldnt work. I tried it on 2 different vcrs. Both times. the tape caught in the vcr and unwound. Not worth buying.,1,0,185
A3FGCY2YHN69QT,0,I do like the fact that I can replace whatever jewel cases I have with these.  I would have given it four stars. and happily so. if it werent for the fact that one of them I got in got busted.  I am not sure if it was shipped that way. or if it got damaged during the shipping process. so it left me a bit disappointed.  But other wise. I got exactly what I wanted. and for a really good price .at the time.  It was below USD1 per pack. not counting shipping. but USD9.99 still isnt bad.. and I would recommend it if it werent for that risk of at least one of them cracking during delivery.,3,0,590
A3FHDRV5NQAIX6,0,I was given this device and absolutely hated the fact that i have to create a BN account in order to use it. Why do i have to do that? Whoever designed this need to be fired.

A3FJSMZ9MXHR2O,33,This is the first time that I myself have been involved in an on line product ordering. I was sure it was a hassle not worth the time and or savings. However. my experience with Amazon was a pleasent experience. If I ever do choose to order products on line . I doubt I will. I would not hesitate to use Amazon if possible and would recommend Amazon to friends. There were pictures of various types of the cassetteradio player I was interested in with good written description and that gave me the opportunity toselect the proper product for my use and I am very pleased with the product. the ordering experience and the overall service.Thanks.James Neal,5,1,654
A3FJY0KUZHLOP5,34,Well I always wanted to try HDCD and this unit was a very inexpensive way for me to do so.  I have a pretty high end system and this player really lets through the warmth and low end extension of my HDCD discs. King Crimson In the Wake of Poseidon sounds better than almost anything Ive heard recorded today.  Tools last album Lateralus is phenomenal!!!  I just wish I could get ACDC re=mastered with HDCD.  Hey. is may be simple but is still deserves good quality.  They are the best hard rock band in the world you know.  I also noted that my regular discs sound .  I guess that could be attributed to the superior AD converter.  Not sure and really dont care.  This player is able to make my discs sound almost as smooth as my LPs.  The remote is too big and isnt very easy to use but the player is worth the money.,4,1,818

A great value...Motorola could learn a lesson from Cobra.,5,1,505
A3FM91FRXZ5MQ3,5353,Ive had this bag for over a year. and it has held up tremedously  with one exception.  The clasps on the shoulder strap bent open. but was able to bend them back using a pliers.  The bag is a bit heavy due to the leather.  but it looks so much better than any nylon one.,4,1,270

I purchased the ASC22s with a rebate so it was an excellent price but they are not nearly as good as the Yahamas were. No tone control so these sound very bassy .but not a good bass. and I cant increase the treble. The yamahas at least had a tone control. Im going to look for the yahama YSTM40s which have 24 watts power. seperate bass and treble controls. comes in black. and doesnt have a subwoofer which I dont need. The Altecs go back. .....,2,0,540

A3FROGHYP055GK,0,The drive would read my floppy with existing data and notify that the disk does not appear formatted. which is incorrect as floppy drives on other computers would read it fine.

A3FU04EM6SPWK1,11,I purchased the Palm IIIX because I thought that it had an open expansion slot for addition of memory upgrade cards.

A3FV80G5TGF2YN,0,Very good product overall.  Manipulation is somewhat clumbersome. but after use for a few hours. it is ok.  I understand that the new version .color. fixes these issues.

A3FVUL251SK3OK,0,I paid a USD150 penalty to get out of a scam u0026quotfree trip to Bahamasu0026quot.  In terms of value. this camera ranks slightly above that.Batteries last about 40 pictures with flash.  The image quality is so pathetic. I cant recognize anyone in the photos.  Bright sunlight is too bright. in doors is too dark and no amount of u0026quotphotoshopu0026quot will sharpen the images.Save your money for purchases like USD5 coffees or a USD40 towing fees that will give you more satisfaction than this camera.,1,0,509
A3FW3NYXBJWEW8,22,These days 10 preset stations for a radio is not much. and it also is a little oversized. What I like about it is the clock and especially the timer that lets you listen for a certain number of minutes .between 1 and 120. before it stops the radio and starts beeping. Of course. if you turn it offon before the set time. the radio will not stop. and the beep will not sound. Tuning is very good but sound is not the best .a personal opinion. certainly..,4,1,453

A3FZ9BSETDQZ7W,12,Didnt realize you need a credit card on file to be able to load books onto the Nook. This was a gift for a 17 yo along with a gift card to order books.

A3FZI1RHDOZEJO,22,Ordered Sept. 2012 from another company on Amazon for USD5.24 which included shipping. I sent it with a gift to someone in the UK.Item is finished well. the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly. Came with instructions and carrying pouch.Only trouble I had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computers power cord plug into the AC receptacle. Very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it.  Much easier after that.The USB slot and its light worked. but the second light for the AC receptacle did not. However. the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through it.The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged. Also. another switch was shown in the instruction diagram .I dont remember what it was supposed to be for. that wasnt on the adapter.Recipient uses the USB slot to charge a camera and MP3 player and reports it is working fine for those devices. Thrilled to have the EU plug too.If it lasts. great product and VERY cost effective.,4,1,1096

A3G330NOEJ8BXT,11,This is perhaps the worst product Ive ever purchased in my life.  First. it cannot find the beginning of tracks on your CD.  For example. if you scan ahead to track 12. it usually cannot find the track. and the times that it does. it often takes as many as FIVE minutes.  The rest of the time it just spins endlessly.  Second. the batteries died on me after using it for only about two hours.  Apparently. it does not shut itself off correctly.  And when the batteries died. the battery indicator was still showing that the batteries were fully charged.  Third. if you open the CD player while it is turned on and switch the CD. it will not let you play the CD.  You must wait a full minute for it to turn itself off before you can begin using it again.  At over 50% off the list price. I thought it was a good deal.  But when youre talking about a total piece of junk that must be either returned or thrown in the garbage. even 99 cents would be too high a price to pay.  Dont take the risk with this low quality product  its just not worth the time. money. or headache!,1,0,1071

A3G54NDKWADXH4,812,This 30  Yamakasi monitor has a great picture. clean attractive lines. and no frills.  It arrived from South Korea to North America in a short number of days .without needing to pay any additional expedited shipping fee.. and it came very wellpackaged.The monitors design has reflective black finishes on the base and front of the bezel. with a tasteful. mattebrushed aluminumsilver band around the outer edges. and matte black finish on the back. which all combine to give it a very attractive look.  I found the list of advertised features. at the top of the right edge of the front bezel is a sticker. which can be easily peeled off to give the monitor an even slightly cleaner look.Where the included stand connects to. and supports the monitor housing. the housing is not very rigid so it bends when the load changes through there more than Id ideally prefer.  However. its not a big deal if not frequently moved around or readjustedrepositioned. and is sitting on a stable. firm desk.  The monitor housing does also include two different VESA mounting options on the back of the housing .a smaller square configuration and a larger rectangle..  Although the stand does seem to allow some pivoting motion leftright. this isnt very useful as the base can simply be rotated on the desk surface.  Some updown pivoting would be useful .and is lacking in the builtin stand.. as Id prefer to adjust it facing upwards a bit more.  .This can still be accomplished. however. by propping something under the front two feet of the stand. although perhaps the steel structure in the stand. if first removed. could be bent. to accomplish similar..Regarding picture quality. as far as I can tell its as good of a panel as can be expected. for its specifications. and likely just as good as any premium name brand monitor with same panel specifications.  It has not a single dead pixel. and seems to have very even backlighting .and havent noticed any  backlight bleed  whatsoever..  It does have a matte surface. which is good for using it in a bright environment .e.g.. a room with the lights on.. although some who are very picky about image quality may conclude that white areas may appear somewhat grainier than they could be. as a result of the matteantiglare surface.   IPS glow  is not noticeable or problematic in a lit room. but is noticeable .and may be objectionable. for those using monitors in a completely dark room .especially when viewing dark imagery from angles somewhat off from the center..Despite this monitor using florescent backlighting. its only about 3  thick in the middle .and only about 1.5  thick at the sides.. and it doesnt seem particularly heavy.  The colors are noticeably nicer .and specifically. a bit more vivid  saturated. than what you see in a typical  white LED  backlit LCD monitor.  I found that the monitor works very well as configured out of the box .after decreasing the brightness a bit..Using the guide at http.www.lagom.nllcdtest I considered making a few color adjustments using the Intel HD 4000 video card driver adjustments. but the only adjustment I thought was somewhat beneficial was to adjust the  gamma  from 1.0 to 0.9 .which seemed to make it closer to the sRBG color space standard..I was glad to find that the brightness +   buttons appear to increase and decrease the backlight intensity level .and dont seem to adversely affect the contrast. like some other imported monitors Ive seen reviewed do..  The brightness adjustment range is also useful.  Ive experienced no problems with the monitor reliably waking up from sleep. or going into power savings mode. as one would hope. whenever requested by the computer.  The monitor operates no warmer than a severalyearold .and proven reliable. Sharp LCD HDTV does.  Basically. there is a bit of warmth you can feel at the top. so there is no cause for alarm there.  When the monitor is  asleep . neither it .nor the  power brick . generate any noticeable heat.  Although this monitor when waking up from  cold sleep  seems to take 12 minutes to reach a full. steadystate brightness level. the initial brightness level is pretty close initially to the steady state level.  When being turned onoff or waking upsleeping. it doesnt produce any sort of light flashing or clickingpopping sound .like my Sharp LCD HDTV does..When the monitor is turned on and not asleep. the 24volt7amp rated  power brick  also operates about as warm as a typical .e.g.. Dell. laptop power brick does. so it doesnt seem excessively warm.  The cable carrying 24VDC from the  power brick  to the monitor. at only about 3.5 feet long. was definitely shorter than Id prefer.  This has necessitated placing the power brick up on the desk next to the monitor .Id otherwise have preferred to tuck the power brick out of sight off the desk. on the floor..  The Amazon seller did include a North American power cable that plugs into the power brick .a very common style computer cable. with the expected NEMA 515 style plug. which had a perfectly ample length .likely six feet long..The included Duallink DVID cable works fine to drive the monitor at its native resolution of 2560x1600 without problems. but at only about about 4 feet long. it will probably be shorter than some will hope or expect.The computer Im using the monitor with is a Dell Latitude E6430s laptop with an integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics card. docked to a Dell  PRO2X  docking station of the newer  USB 3.0  variety.  As I thought might be the case for getting this monitor working on this setup. I did find that I needed an active DisplayPort to Duallink DVID adapter to get the full 2560x1600 resolution working.  .Although plugging directly into the PRO2Xs  Duallink DVID looking  receptacle only yielded a 1280x800 pixel resolution. I believe this is an issue with the PRO2X docking stations design. and not with the Yamakasi monitor.  Luckily. the USBpowered DisplayPort to DVI adapter .Dell Bizlink XT625. only cost about USD30 used from an online auction site.,5,1,6012
A3G607TMMM0HVV,33,I had some trouble getting this to work. After some experimentation. I found out that the mouse had no power supply therefore the computer would not recognize the mouse. This is normal...A serial port has no designated power supply pin. I thought I saw something on the label that said that only mice equipped to handle this type of device should be used. In other words. consult your mouse documentation .if you have any. first to make sure it is compatible.,1,0,459
A3G636N0YXQA7A,0,OK. I got this thing and plugged it in as instructed. to which it responded by doing Nothing.  After some further research. I found that it likes to be updated.

A3GBTXO71DJ6GO,0,I dont read a ton so I didnt want to pay a huge premium for an ereader.  I have an iPad but when I do read. sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this. the basic Kindle. and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it. the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didnt have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasnt quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought itd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and youre ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook. not a huge deal. but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time. it wasnt the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer.I think the Kindle is the same way as well though..The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings. but they dont outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint Id give it 5 stars. just some other things that popped up that arent big deals. but noticable.  Id recommend this to anyone like myself who doesnt do a ton of reading. but still wants a simple ereader.  If you are a more serious reader. Id probably spring for the Paperwhite.,3,0,2055

A3GIM0XAIJTHM2,0,First used this camera at the Las Vegas CES show last month. all pictures came out perfect. including all the night scenes.  I used the 400 speed film indoors and 200 speed film outdoors had no problem with the flash by observing the maximum distances outlined by the guide.  Its light to carry  and simple to use.  The only shortcomings are the tiny buttons to switch  flash modes  I have to use my keys or toothpick to depress them.  I got  this camera from another retailer .Wxxxxxx. at a lesser price.,4,1,505
A3GM64N13BILUP,1010,When it first hit the market. this was one of the best DVD players out there. It had all the options. a great remote. and incredible picture quality. Now. however. it is out of date  u0026quothigh techu0026quot DVDs like _Planet of the Apes_ will make this player go nuts. and sometimes just jam completely.

A3GUSJAQREH2SP,1422,Needed this for the tape deck in my car to play my iPod. Item came fast and worked just fine. Only thing was the product looked as though it has been sitting in a warehouse for years....which whatever cause it IS something that isnt made anymore. It seemed as though since it was old some of the cleaner fluid may have dried up a bit. it was sealed when I got it. but there were only a few drops in it. I used it once. it served its purpose. and I just figured Id buy more when I needed it. but thats a bummer at the price for one or two uses. I still rated it at 4 stars cause I wouldve had no tape deck if it wasnt for them. I did keep the tape cause you could always try a few drops of water...that was a trick we used as kids.,4,1,730
A3GVAOPE23ATI3,0,I purchased this cable for my Canon EOS Rebel T2i DSLR from Amazon. This cable is working well as is expected.

A3GW639VY3QR2M,0,I have had my Rio500 for a couple months now and I love it.  The sound is excellent and it does not skip a beat.  It is great for running since it is small .about the size of a deck of playing cards.. lightweight .2.7 ounces. and has a case to clip to your pants.  I have an AIWA CD player with 40  second electronic anti shock system but when I run the only way it does not  skip is when I hold the player in my hand.  If you like to run and listen  to good tunes the Rio500 works great.The software that is included  with the Rio500 is ok but I believe that Music Match Jukebox .MMJ.is much  better.  I have been using MMJ for creating various play lists. striping  songs off CDs and downloading MP3 files to the Rio500.The headphones  that are included with the Rio500 are not very good.  They have very poor  sensitivity. bandwidth and a real pain to fit in your ears. literally.  I  would recommend getting the Sony MDRA30 or the Sennheiser MX5 headphones  for excellent bass and overall quality sound.  It is extra for  the headphones but well worth it.The unit is really easy to setup for  use with your computer.  What you do is have your computer up and running  and power off on the Rio500.  Then connect the USB cable to both the Rio500  and the computer.  Turn the power on for the Rio500 and Windows 98 takes  care of the rest and adds the device to your USB controllers.  After  Windows recognizes the device then open up Music Match Jukebox and start  fooling around.Downloading music to the Rio500 is quick and easy.  It  doesnt take very much time .a couple of minutes. to fill up the 64 MB of  the internal memory.  This will give you about an hour of quality music.  I  havent really had much use for the external memory since I save various  play lists on my computer and download to the Rio500 when I feel like  listening to something new.  Everything is saved on the Rio500 until you  delete it.One caveat I noticed is make sure you have a fresh battery  installed when you want to delete some songs.  I had a problem playing some  tracks after I tried to delete a couple of songs with the battery  indicating one segment left.  It was like the songs were not being deleted  completely.  I could see some junk on the display when that particular  track appeared.  To solve this problem I put a fresh battery in and erased  all the songs from the players memory and then reprogrammed it.  That  took care of the problem.All in all I am quite satisfied with the Rio500  it and des it has to offer.  The main reason I purchased the device was to  get quality skip free music and have the ability to quickly add songs and  remove songs.  It certainly performs those tasks rather well.  It is a 5  star product with the addition of MMJ and the Sony headphones.,4,1,2777
A3GW639VY3QR2M,4445,I have been very pleased with the performance and from what I have seen of the other Internet cameras out there this one has to be the best.It has some really nice features that separate it from the rest.  Automatic aperture adjustment so you always have the correct lighting  regardless of how much light is in the room.  When you have just the right  mix of light the color is impressive. Small size about the size of  a cassette tape. Light in front indicates camera is active.  Manual focus knob on the front to get a clear image and is really good on  closeups up to an inch away. No external power is required as the  unit gets its power from the USB bus. Button on front to take an  instant picture. The software allows for six different image size  formats and six different image color formats.I didnt have any  problems setting up the camera as I followed the instructions that came  with the unit.All around it is a very good camera for the Internet but  it certainly is not near the picture quality level of the mega pixel  digital cameras.,5,1,1052
A3GX5A7W60G4VK,1010,Received first charger and it would not work. It only discharged my garmin 1450 GPS. Sent me a second one and it did the same thing.

A3GY1MYWYR2WX5,22,The hand crank on the tripod broke the first time I used it.  Called Tiffen to get a replacement since they have a ten year warranty on their product.  They said they would send out the replacement part. but after longer then a month I havent received anything. which Im sure will be the case until I throw the piece of c... out!!!  Also. the camera moves on the tripod when the shutter is pushed.  This seems odd since the use of a tripod is supposed to prevent this from happening.  Dissatisfied customer.  Dont buy if you expect to have the item repaired if it breaks within the warranty period. a laugh out loud ten years. or if your serious about quality.  Better make that warranty ten minutes gentlemen!!,1,0,711
A3GYTCCZ3OI7S2,34,I am really disappointed in both Amazon and the company that actually sold me my Garmin 3490LT.  The Garmin I bought is wonderful.  The recommendations made by Amazon and the company that actually filled the order for the accessories that go with it are not they are for an entirely different model!  I returned the accessories that were recommended that I buy I did not want a refund.  I just wanted the correct accessories for the unit I bought.  Because my friend who advised me to get a Garmin was on vacation and came back after the time limit. I did not get full credit for my accessory purchase  even though I was told by Amazon that these were recommended for my unit!  I was finally told they did not have the correct accessories for my unit to sell.  Please.  I think this was a company mistake and I should receive a full refund on the original accessory order.  The accessories were not used  they would not fit the unit.  If I had asked for money back. I could understand the deduction. but I just wanted the correct accessories for the unit.  Those who sold me the Garmin who tried to rectify the situation tried to help however. they didnt know what the correct accessories were either.My recommendation to you is watch what is recommended for accessories the people who will try to help you correct the problem are nice people who are genuinely trying to straighten out the problem.  But they are not always knowledgeable about the product.  That means youre stuck!  Either with incorrect equipmentaccessories or if youre over the time limit like I was. you only get part of your money back.,1,0,1607

A3H150XFJ7S4KE,0,Amamax sent me the wrong ram to start with. I mean the numbers werent even close to being the same as the one in the picture or the listing. I tried it anyway to see if it might be another brands substitute and my machine wouldnt even try to boot with this ram in it. The packaging was a joke. they dropped it in a ziplock bag and put  that in a bubble envelope none of which offered much protection but by some miracle it did make it without getting broken. When I emailed them about the issue they took several days to get back to me and when they did they didnt even offer to replace it. they just told me to return it. I ask you what the hell kind of service is that? Emails take forever out of this place and when you are lucky enough to get one its far from being friendly. I will NEVER buy another item from AMAMAX again EVER!,1,0,833

A3H1SOM7O7NH91,0,As an unobtrusive weather radio that works. this one is it. It has full featured S.A.M.E. capabilties. It will store up to 15 county identifiers .FIPS codes. The receiver is excellent and audio is clear u0026amp quiet. I have owned this radio for almost a year and still keep the manual close by. It is sort of a pain to program. But when it comes to function it is great. Mine came with an AC adapter. It has 9V battery backup. external antenna. and alert jacks. Speaker and warning signal volumes are adjusted individually. The alerts can be set for tone or voice. The manual shows over 35 types of alerts it will display on the LCD screen as well as different tone patterns. And as the NWS adds new alert capabilities it will receive them automatically. Three different colored leds show u0026quotwarningu0026quot. u0026quotwatchu0026quot or u0026quotstatementu0026quot. Up to three different overlapping alerts with overlapping effective time periods can be stored and reviewed by scrolling the display. The display is rather rudimentary. but the performance of the radio makes up for it. When it is connected to external power .it can be used in the car with the proper cig plug. the display is constantly illuminated. It is also set to respond to NWS test broadcasts. The alarm clock fuctions as an alarm clock with snooze. A large bar on the front turns the radio u0026amp alert on u0026amp off very conveniently. Once the radio is programmed. it works quite well. I have had numerous Weather radios .and returned many also. and this is the best overall performer yet. WX capability is being added to all sorts of radio products with iffy results. This one works and doesnt cost an arm and a leg. Just keep your manual.,4,1,1726
A3H2UQ9KKYLEC7,5657,The case is excellent  beautifully made. and sits well in the hand. For reading on the train. I fold the cahier pad side back underneath. and when I need to take notes.

A3HGTTFIDLCWDJ,0,The cover is snazzy looking if a bit stiff. probably due to the leather. I wish it had the extra little pockets that the original vinyl one had .from April 2012.. made of the same material and color as the cover. with the lining as contrast. but. at least it has one pocket. good for the hand to slip into and hold the tablet with the cover bent backwards. I prefer the leather look one I had to the real leather. because it wasnt as stiff and was slightly less heavy.Bu0026N has the best covers for devices by far. This may come from their long experience with book publishers. They should make them for all devices. The 3 point holders are perfect. as is the construction of the cover.

A3HHFX4JF0ODXB,33,There are many similar purchasers of the Sony S7700 that are extremely disappointed in the sound quality of this unit and have had another piece of equipment previously whos audio was far superior and cost less money.  For example. my previous player was a Sony S530D which had within 6 months  lipsync problems. an audio that would periodically cutout. and a picture  that froze and brokeup into pixels .similar to satellite broadcast  problems.. however. its audio was excellent when it worked.  Now that I  have moved to the topoftheline in Sony DVD players. I am again  disappointed and am of the opinion that they can not make a quality product  that is complete. Thus far. I have contacted Sony to see if they are  willing to do anything about the situation and to determine if the reported  downsampling of the digital output from 97 MHz to 48 MHz is the cause for  the poor sound quality or. if not. whether they will do something about  this issue.  At this point I am not very optimistic about Sony  satisfactorily addressing this issue and offering a fix via a service  center.  Unfortunately. out of all the buyers who have this same issue and  want good sound quality. none have posted results of pursuing the  downsampling fix by MSB to address this issuedoes it work or is it  something else.  This unit was supposedly designed to be a top quality  audio player since it has dual discrete pickups with separate lasers for CD  and DVD at the optimal frequencies. however. the audio output is dismal at  best for both.  If I were the manufacturer of this product. I would be so  embarrassed about my topoftheline product. I would move heaven and earth  to rectify this issue. we can only assume that they are either incapable or  dont care.,2,0,1753
A3HICVLF4PFFMN,1111,bought for a spare for my 9  Nook HD and it fit perfectly.  Very satisfied with the price much less than on the BN site,5,0,119

A3HJ888Q5EOO66,13,Heavy duty construction. easy to install. could have easer adjustment knobs as I use this on an RV and constantly make mount adjustments. Other than that this is a great product for the price and I would recommend it to anyone.,4,1,227
A3HJGWV3E5U502,0,Beauty is deceiving. The worst thing about this radio is that the plastic onoff button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach. Get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick. Keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best. and confusing to use. The plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion. Thousands of these must be sitting in drawers. silenced by the elements! Junk...thats why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers.,1,0,522
A3HJODLTA7H1FY,0,This P.O.S was dead on arrival. Cheap Chinese junk with chinglish manual. No power supply included. Purchased for my Surface Pro tablet and wont recognize device. Junk !,1,0,169
A3HJTFYCGN5YBA,0,Id been looking for a Moleskine iPad folio since I originally heard about them. The fact that I have a 1st gen iPad complicates things further because of the number of covers that arent made for it. Moleskine is the only name brand that Ive found that still is actively making them. Id been looking for a iPad cove that had a paper pad included with it for a while. but all of them that Id looked at seemed cheap or overly bulky. Bulky however is the nature of Folio cases that hold paper. and this one is bulkier than my Apple designed tablet cover. but at 1.2  x 8  x 10  its smaller than my textbooks for school as well as the other paper folio cases that Ive looked at. Im a big fan of the Moleskine brand and am not in the least bit disappointed with the Folio I received. Point in fact. there are only 2 things that kept this from being a 5 star rating for me. 1.. The design doesnt allow for the tablet to be propped at a low angle .for typing.. nor does it secure when propping it at a high angle .for watching movies.. 2.. The strap in design isnt strong enough to keep the iPad snug in the center of the case. it wont fall out. but it does shift as much as 14 . There is a 3rd complaint. but its only that the reporters pad thats included isnt a standard paper size. that means that when the time comes to replace it Ill either have to go for smaller paper or order replacements from Moleskine for about USD20 for 2.,4,1,1426
A3HL6HIW3N3H18,0,If your intention is just to take quick shots and send your friends and relatives pictures through email. or even to post u0026quotnotsosophisticatedu0026quot images on your web page. then this camera  is for you.  These were the steps I took to begin taking great pictures.  .1. Take the stuff out of the box. .2. Put the batteries in the camera and  set the date. .3. Install the PhotoMAX software in the PC. .4. Take  pictures. .5. Load pictures into PC using software and save images as .jpg  files. .6. Send friends and family pictures through email.  Its that  simple!The only downside I see with this product is the annoying green  indicator light in the viewfinder.  And this camera doesnt really do well  with closeup shots.  You have to be at least three feet away.  Also only  use the video screen when you are using the AC adapter.  If you dont. then  your batteries will drain fast.Bottomline is I am happy with this  product and I got my moneys worth.,4,1,965
A3HMTSNKKZ82GH,6868,I have owned this version of Denon CD player for 5 years and it has proven to be an excellent component for its price range.  My only regret is that I will have to sell it before I go back to the US.  It is simple to use. the random function is truly random in selecting across 5 disks and the programmi ng feature has worked well for parties.  The playback is crisp and clean and I have not had trouble with it recognizing even my most well traveled CDs.  Great value for the price and I will purchase Denon products again.,4,1,524

A3HPCRD9RX351S,22,Itll be gone soon. and I cant say Ill miss it. Our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so I got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the Kindle Color Nook. It doesnt overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as Our Kindle Fires. Text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy. ONE advantage the Nook has over the Fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the Fires percent of book read. Mrs. Spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents.My wife and I are both comfortable navigating the Fire and barely had to refer to the owners e manual. I dont like moving around on the Nook. and that may be solely because Id become used to the ease of the Fire. Trying to surf the web on the Nook was very frustrating. and watching movies or video clips on the Nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion. slow responses. and freezes. We watch free TV shows on the Kindle Fire with smooth enjoyment.The Fire was a gift to my wife from me. She loves it. If I were to buy a small device for reading. Id prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads. That method may preclude the ability to get free books .it does on the Kindle.. but its a circumstance Id accept.In summary. the Color Nook is pretty good as a reader. Those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the Nook on some childrens books and the option to have the book read aloud by the Nook voice. As a web browser. the Nook . in my experience. doesnt work as well as the Fire does.In choosing between the two devices. I chose the Fire because I prefer the Amazon site to Bu0026Ns. like the vast number of Kindle books on Amazon. and was totally persuaded by the vast array of  free books. movies. and TV shows that come with Amazon prime.,3,0,1870

A3HQRZNBF4JU86,0,When it says formatted for GoPro. that makes me assume that indeed. once I receive this card it will work properly.Nope. This card might work for some GoPros but if you have a Hero 3 + and are looking to shoot in highest  protune quality. this card will not work!!!!It only writes 30 mbs where as the new GoPro requires a minimum of 45 mbs if you want the best of the best.Wanted to film... Not happy.,1,0,401
A3HR8CH2Q18VQU,33,Ive heard that some Smile cameras apparently come with defective serial cables. I thought I had the same until I found that you have to push the connectors all the way into the sockets for the camera to work properly. or you get error messages. The camera is extremely small and light. I has a flash and a selftimer. And there is a bug when you connect to the computer which indicates that the cameras batteries are dead. but reconnecting the cable fixes this and shows the correct amount of battery power left. The pictures are basically awful but you can still make out stuff in the pictures. Great for fooling around with. Exactly what I use it for. Comes with batteries. software and a cool soft case. No AC adapter. Always runs on batteries. Needs special video capture card for video  conferencing. if your video card is built into the motherboard. Your decision to buy it.,3,0,879
A3HR8CYA0YAZUM,11,Im very happy with this headset. Ive had it for about a month and have been using it daily .MonFri.. The sound quality is GREATboth on my end and on the other end. for those that I am talking to.The only thing that would make this headset a 5rating. is if it had a mute button on it.But. its a great value and I would purchase it again.,4,1,336
A3HRZP650QIP32,11,Bought this for my 92 year old mother. u0026 I wasnt sure if she could manage a  electronic  reader. but she loves it! It is easy for her to operate u0026 lightweight for her to hold for a long time. since she reads all day.,5,1,224
A3HSOVPO4E48JD,22,Having tried almost ever shower radio on the market  I was close to giving up until I saw this one.  Granted it costs more than the u0026quotaverageu0026quot shower radios  but there is reason. It works!  You also save tons of money on batteries as it just doesnt eat them like the others.  My husband and I both use this in the a.m. and we each have different radio stations we like.  We have not had trouble presetting the channels or switching back and forth between them.  Seems like the more negative reviews of this product are due to placement of the radio.  Keep it out of direct waterfalls maybe get a small shower shelf to place it where you can easily see and use the controls?  Lastly. the timeroff button is my favorite.  I set it for 20 mins giving me time to shower and finish up in the bathroom in the a.m. before heading to work.  You dont have to worry about getting back in the wet shower area to turn it off.  Give this a try  treat it well and youll be happy !,5,1,981
A3HTP73P5FZIQ1,2020,I bought this product for listening to the Today show while I walk in the morning. The reception has been disappointing. Ive also found it difficult to set the presets.

A3HUNJWU8EM5C1,0,As soon as this player arrived I unwrapped and installed in. The installation was easy you have the option of using two different cords. As soon as you connect to your computer however. your computer has to restart every single time you use it . annoying. however. i proceeded to try it out and would have kept it even though it shut my computer down and restarted it each time. I  popped a disk in and it worked so i thought good does what i need to to do. A week later. I get it out and proceed to use it . plug it in computer restarts and nothing. does not load my cd. So i try the 2nd cord and still nothing. So. i figured i just better send it back I guess it was only good for one use and what do you know my cd wont come out the door will not eject. I had to manually remove the front of the case and work with it about a hour to get my disk out returning this mess ASAP and ordering something else. i have a netbook so i have to purchase a external drive.,2,0,963
A3HUVOVDGV095O,14,I bought this item mainly as a way to keep track of my work schedule. appointments and contacts. and it has done all that and more! I bought this unit as a refurbished item. but I cant even tell that it was ever used. I have not had any problems with it at all! Still figuring out how everything works on it. but I gotta say. right now Im loving having it!,4,1,356
A3HW3YH05I74VO,0,Bought it primarily for trips. My first experience with CBs. Will probably buy another one for other car. Definitely works much better with roof mounted antenna. Use it with Lil Willie magnetic mount antenna.,4,1,208
A3HW4KT09ZSSD0,0,Last month. my Nook became completely pixilated and unreadable... got a replacement. same thing happened within 3 weeks. Bu0026N is replacing it. but will not let me pay the difference to get a Nook color. I do NOT recommend the standard Nook. as Ive had two defective devices in less than a month.I appreciate their willingness to replace the device. but am very frustrated by the defects. and the fact that they will not allow me to exchange it .and pay the difference!. for a Nook Color. when clearly the standard Nook is a subpar product.,2,0,542
A3HWA8EELIDVS9,34,I bought these accidentally  thought I was getting jewel cases. not inserts.Anyway. decided to keep them. Went to use them. and each page only prints two inserts. when they could easily print four. I hate killing trees and polluting with the discard.,3,0,250
A3HWSNKLM4CHCD,1,Had a 50% failure rate. Ordered two to use on our Motorolas. One unit failed to transmit after three days use. Would key radio. but no transmit audio. Opened up the case and reseated the plug inside and now works. These work well and are well made. Includes a rubber gasket between the front and back of the case and the PTT switch. As everyone else has said. the cable need to be at least a foot longer. I rated them a four as they do work well.,4,1,446
A3HXH9TNTO86BC,0,I bought this to use on my Garmin Rhino 530 and I had nothing but issues out in the field.  Bought 2 of these and wish I didnt.  Bad connection and static.  Cut out almost every time.  Even if we were no farther than 50 yards away.  If you have a Garmin Rhino. stay clear of this one.  Stick with the Garmin one even if its more money.,1,0,335
A3HYF6WCIP4XXR,0,I have owned two great Sony VCRs that both eventually began to eat my VHS tapes.  I recently bought a very reasonably priced identical replacement VCR. but this time I knew I had better keep those heads clean if the VCR was going to last longer than a couple of years.  So I purchased this Allsop 600000 3in1 Video Cleaner.  So far Ive used it only once. but I am hoping regular usage will prolong the life of this latest VCR replacement purchase.  I realize that standalone VCRs are a thing of the past. but since I dont own TIVO or any other type of DVR. I am trying to preserve my VCR as long as possible.  This Allsop product seems to be very high quality for doing the job.,4,1,678
A3HYF6WCIP4XXR,35,I dont know where these tapes were manufactured. but they are very poor quality and eventually ruined one of my VCRs.  They dirty the heads in no time flat. and no amount of cleaning helps.  I definitely would not recommend buying these Maxell tapes.,1,0,250
A3HYYO8PBJZ0J0,0,Im pleased with the VCR. but it took about an hour to get it set up properly.  Plug u0026amp play didnt work.  I finally ended up setting the channels and clock manually. and the initial configuration is relatively  complicated.  I am a little bit disappointed with the remote.  One reason  that I selected a JVC VCR is because I hoped it would interoperate well  with my other JVC components. but the remote is awkward to use with my TV  and DBS.  Overall though. it has a lot of nice features for the money. and  the picture quality is good.,3,0,543

A3I0P9OHLO63XG,0,This recorder is an excellent piece of electronics.  It is easy to use. and has some handy features such as pause .while recording in the same message.. fast playback. hold .to prevent inadvertant button operation..  and forward or back skip.  Holding in the stop key allows one to see how  much recording time is left.  The erase button is indented to avoid  accidents. and the user is prompted to confirm any erasures with a second  press.Voice quality is great in 33 minute mode. I frequently use mine  in the car with the radio on and get excellent results.  In 90 min mode.  however. a deep voice is hard to make out clearly .I agree with the  reviewer below.  a 60 min. mode would have been a good compromise..Ive used mine daily for 3 months to make brief notes.  I had to change  the AAA battery for the first time only recently.  It gave a low battery  signal and saved all my messages while I replaced the battery.It is  small enough .4.5u0026quot. that I keep mine in my front pocket at all times.  with the strap hanging out so I can whip it out quickly.  It is very well  designed and easy to operate.  I have not used other digital recorders. but  compared to the many microcassette recorders Ive put up with. this thing  is fantastic!,5,1,1249

A3I6CFMBRH0QWV,11,These headphones are a great value.  They cover the full ear ear. which is a plus. and the volume control on the cord has come in very useful when you cant reach the volume control on the device youre using.  The mute button  is also a great feature .something you wouldnt expect on headphones at  this price. but not being able to make it u0026quotstick downu0026quot can be a  bit bothersome. still a great bargain!,5,1,417
A3I6EURDC734SU,1515,I purchased the kindle because I thought that it would be easier to get service at Bu0026N. as well as the basic version because it might have less issues.  I was wrong.  While some people might have gotten a good nook. I got the worst one imaginable.  I am unable to get the books that I purchased on to my nook. unless I am plugged into my computer and put them on manually.  It constantly freezes. sometimes 5 plus times a night.  Whenever I call they have me go to the store. and when I go to the store they have me call.  It is the worst service I have ever received. the nook rarely works the way it should. and every night when I am trying to read in bed. and think towards the money that I am saving up to buy a Kindle.Do yourselves a favor. and DO NOT BUY A NOOK!  If you get the one that doesnt work. it is impossible to remedy. and you are out a bunch of money.,1,0,872
A3I8065KZNGX5D,29,These binoculars looks like a very old design.  The distance betwen the two objectives is closer than my other binoculars.  even of the same brand.

A3I8PROROCN7BX,0,The colors are clear as well as the images.  I would give the card 5 stars but....the installation was a little tricky.

A3I9WLNF7HB4JW,11,I bought the biggest one in the neutral tone and used it for a photoshoot and the pictures looked a lot better than they usually do.

A3IBOQ8R44YG9L,11,If this is your first headset or you dont plan to have heavyuse. this is as good as it gets. ...the sound quality is goodand it is relatively comfortable. However. if you are going to spend time with this. the Plantronics M175 by far worth the additional expense. Much more invisible from the stand point of the user .you completely forget its on your head. and the listener on the other end. I have them both and switch to the Plantronics unit when I know it is going to be a long call or I going to be moving about.,4,1,517
A3IBOQ8R44YG9L,3940,Other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the benefits of this tool so Ill be brief. First. you will use it in new ways as long as youre not embarassed by the note to self jokes. Phone numbers.  addresses. to dos. random musings. and more. For months when I was very  busy Id keep it near my bed to clear my head before falling asleep.  Eventually enough would be in the recorder .and I didnt have to turn on  the light. that I could stop worrying about forgetting.I bought the  Sony version of this product and in the end its probably a wash. They have  the same functionality. linking capability. length. etc. The Sony is much  more elegant and that is what won the day. Later. I regreted not buying  this one because of the Via Voice software .if only just to play with it.  but I have heard not one supportive comment about it. Either nobody is  using it or it doesnt work.RE. Linking or downloading. This is useful  if you need to store things .remember. there is no tape to remove if you  want to keep something. such as lectures. interviews. The problem is that  the compression software is not yet standardized and files end up being  huge.If youre using this as a memo device and have no storage needs.  Id consider the model below this .I think its about half the  price..Last note. If you already carry a cell phone and a PDA. you will  find youre pockets too full with this addition. Like me. you will hope for  some convergence soon. If this were in my Nokia. Id be sending voice  emails all the time.,4,1,1529
A3IBOQ8R44YG9L,2626,If you are considering the Sony .I cant remember the . there is not much difference other than the price .the Sony is almost double.. Ive also never used the extra 30 minutes.Beyond that. the Sony does have the  ability to download files via a cable. Unfortunately. this was developed  before any good compression had standardized and transfered files end up  being enormous. Id wait unitl this linking is either infrared or the  recording ability is on your Palm.,4,1,464
A3IBPB7YVEWQ7G,1517,Am on my third one of this model...each one with the same problem.  After a few viewings. it began to get choosy about which DVDs it would read.  Sometimes it would not even acknowledge that a DVD had been inserted!  I finally figured out how to fix it. since RCA could not.  When it does this. you have to unplug the machine from the outlet for about a half hour.  Apparently this resets something and allows it to read again. Now. until I can replace it with a better machine. I unplug it each time I turn it off.  So far. this works.  Its a shame...I have always liked RCA until this machine.  It performs GREAT when it works. but I will think twice before I buy an RCA product again.,1,0,687
A3IBYTY0PMVL40,0,I bought this product because. frankly. it was the only case taht brought out the style of the palm V. When i first bought it. i noticed it was made of plastic and 2 thin sheets of metal. Everything works fine untill about  the 3rd month or so into heavy use. The springs that controls the front  panel no longer works. the exterior is tarnished. and the cheap metal  plates are starting to become unglued. If you want classy case for less  money. go with a slim leather case. otherwise there are sturdier cases out  there. BTW it does do a good job at keeping the palm V from turing on by  accident.,2,0,600

A3ICHEO78NFE4Y,0,This movie was playing at Radio City Music Hall back in the days of the moviestage show formt.  It was also presented in 70mm on that huge Radio City screen. I remember how impressed i was with that opening scene with the steam boat going down the river and you see Tom running thru the field and the music builds more and more.  Wow....what a great movie!Ive seen many versions of u0026quotTom Sawyeru0026quot but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen.  Maybe because its a musical. Whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by its gradure and scope. A must for ever American kid and adult too. This is as red. white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made. .hehe.  Buy it before some group puts a ban on it. Which should want you to buy this for the kids even more. They dont make them like this anymore.,5,1,898
A3IDLIHPSQ7FDF,3640,I bought this as a Christmas present for my fatherinlaw. He is a retired cop but still spends a lot of time driving to see family. This unit is compact and very easy to set up and use. The weather stations come in very clear just about everywhere he goes. The only drawback is the limited range. He is thinking about getting an antenna for his car to boost the signal strength. Overall. its still a great product and a good value.,4,1,430
A3IE39HUG07GH9,12,My primary motivation for purchasing wireless headphones was to permit me to listen to music or television programming while on my exercise bike at home.  Because acoustic isolation was desirable. I preferred a closed cup headphone design that would block much ambient sound.  I have been quite pleased with the Advent AW770 headphones.  They do. indeed. isolate me from most ambient noise. which is ideal for listening to music or television while exercisingwithout having to turn the volume up to earsplitting levels.  .Of course. this is highly undesirable if you need to be able to easily hear a baby crying from a distant room in your home..My stereo and exercise bike are in my finished basement. and I get acceptable audio quality throughout my house. in spite of having the transmitter below ground level.  While the range and audio quality are good. the headphones do crackle from varying signal strength and interference as I walk across the house.  There is also a very noticeablebut not unbearableamount of background hiss from the builtin amplifier.  If you listen to pop music. most country. blues. or classic rock. the hiss will not be noticeable most of the time however. you may find it distracting if you are a classical music fan. as the hiss becomes more conspicuous during quiet passages.I have been perfectly satisfied with the overall sound quality of the headphones.  I ended up choosing to use a monitor output on my stereo receiver. since I found no need to alter the signal .e.g.. add bass or otherwise tweak the frequency response..  Using a fixedlevel audio output is desirable. since you must calibrate the transmitter for the audio sources output level for maximum performace and to avoid distorted sound.  This becomes much more difficult if the phones are connected to a TV or stereo headphone jack. which puts out varying amounts of signal.  Lest you worry. the product includes nearly every conceivable connector and adaptor cable one could possibly need for virtually any hookup scenario.Finally. I have been impressed with battery life.  The included rechargeables last 56 hours.  I know this not from exercising in my basement for 6 hours at a time rather. I have enjoyed having the headphones and their good sound quality so much that I have been wearing them when I study.  Since my exams are this week and the next. Ive spent many hours with them clamped over my head!,4,1,2409

A3IFE8L14OEWSN,11,Would have been 5 stars if not for the installation problems.  3 stars as a warning to those who are not very PC savy.I bought this card mostly for the software .no problems with the card. after receiving a digital camcorder for Christmas.  I had heard that the software was designed to be easy to use and included titling.  It is designed very nicely. very intuitive. without a lot of extras.  I will start by saying I was eventually successful in editing a 10 minute video. and putting it back on digital tape.  Im currently working on others...Getting there.I started with Windows 98 installed on a dell machine.  The installation was only partially successful off the CD.  Titling didnt work. and a few other things were broken which I discovered later.All my problems seem to center around two issues. first. dos file names get created by the installer.  I had to manually rename some files which I figured out by using the version checker that comes with the software.  This is by far the worst installation of any comercial software I have ever seen.  Second. the updates from Pinnacle are as bad as the original installer.  I had trouble with rescon800.dll getting deleted and the installer would stop because it couldnt find it.  I had to manually restore the file with Norton Utilities.Creating Mpegs was also broken due to DOS file names.Tips.1. Ive heard of problems using the preview and then recapturing at full quality.  I skipped that and bought a 40 Gig HD for editing fully captured video.2. I upgraded to 256MB RAM.  I was consistently running low with 128MB. and you dont want your system swapping to disk when you are processing a video stream.3. I always manually close almost everything by using the task menu .ctrlaltdelete. before any capturing or rendering.  If you can play back a full screen video without any frames jerking. you can skip this step.4.  Dont expect your final output to be longer than 18 minutes.  I dont know if more expensive software can break that barrier. but Ive decided that Im more likely to go back and watch a video if its around 10 minutes or less anyway.  So Im living with it.5.  Resign yourself ahead of time to not be frustrated by the fact that this could be one of the greatest products ever if Pinnacle would use a decent installation package.6.  Realize that editing video takes a lot of time. the more you shoot. the more you will have to watch and rewatch to get the highlights I find that the first edit needs to be performed by the camera operator.Despite the frustrations. Ive had a lot of fun with this product.,3,0,2580

A3IH7TF1TSF8PL,0,I bought the callaway golf gps for my husband.it came with 2 other extras things. It was shipped sooner than the date they said. My husband uses it all the time. He plays a minimum of two times a week. He says the GPS has helped his game. He can get an aerial view of the course before he plays on it. Has courses for all around the US and loads about 77 at one time. Very easy to use. He loves it! Buy it for any golfer they will love it too.,5,1,443

A3IL06W2AR2S6G,13,I noticed that there was an unhappy customer for this card. comparing it to the GeForce cards. As I agree with most of what is said. I also would like to point out that Glide is not... thats u0026quotnotu0026quot... on its way out. Please. the fact that it is only supported by one chipset? And how  many video cards run this chipset? Yah. thas what I thought ..Anyways.  yes. the GeForce does outperform a Voodoo 3 card. It also costs USD100 or  more over a voodoo 3 card. But. the Voodoo 3 card outperforms the GeForce  cards in OpenGl. Period. Check all the reviews .. This card is for me. and  will be a happy addition to my puters case.Please take note on the  users review commenting on the likeness of Voodoo3 to SoundBlaster. Only  one company runs that chipset as well and has been THE leader ever since  they showed up. I could only wish the Voodoo 4 was out already!,5,1,877

A3IPIL8WC0E24B,22,There are enough flaws and shortcomings in this device to make it very difficult to use and very disappointing at many points. To begin with. the navigation is not very responsive. The select text feature works most of the time. but fails often enough to be really annoying. Many of the books are not easily moved around in. For example. in a copy of the KJB I bought. the book headings in the TC do not take you to the book  you have to use the slide feature and guess roughly where. say. Ruth begins. Very frustrating and timeconsuming. Indexes are not navigable in the books Ive bought.Some books just seems to be defective. I bought a poetry anthology that I cant get to work  it just stalled out on a certain page and is frozen.The ferature that allows you select type size is great. But be aware that some books are just pdflike texts and if its small type youre out of luck. Some of the free and cheapy stuff reads up poorly. such as a copy of A Boys Will where the lines seem to ahve been sprayed around the page at random. Same with Leaves of Grass.There are supopsedly millions of titles available. but unless your taste runs pretty much to contemporary mass market fiction. pornography aimed at the female market and the like youre going to be disappointed in what isnt available. Example. There are some 19th century translations of Montaignes Essays but you cant buy the Donald Frame or M.A. Screech translations. Titles by major authors are unavailable. Examples. Gore Vidal. Anthony Burgess. T. S. Eliot. Mary McCarthy.,3,0,1534
A3IPKBO0ZU4HIP,1,I bought this model over the higherresolution Sony versions. and Im very satisfied. If you want 1024x768 pictures. go ahead and spend the extra money. But this one does just great. The ability to pop in a fresh diskette  and keep shooting is addictive. Preview and delete shots easily. Remarkably  good battery life. The 10x zoom is amazing. will blow you away. Ive used  it to document everything from the wiring and hoses on my sailboat to  furniture we might want to add to our home. Incredibly convenient. simple  to use. One thing to watch for. bright sunlight behind you can wash out the  LCD display so its hard to see what youre shooting. So just find some  shade or reposition your shot. Only if youre stuck in the Sahara is it  that a big deal.  Highly recommended. youll love it.,5,1,790
A3IQGFB959IR4P,4545,Thought the unit was going to be a good unit. but was I wrong very wrong. The unit has a bad probleum with the 12 volty pulg in. They replaced the unit once in 6 months and the second unit last about 8 months before it started giving me trouble. but would they stand behind it NO NO NO. They said it had been over a year since I had bought the first unit so it was not covered.  The person I talked with at the Tec centered knew very well what I was talking about. If I made something that cost as much and made claims of how great a unit it was I would stand behind it and if I knew of probleums with the 12 plug in I would come up with a fix.  So take your chances if you buy one from Rand McNally hope it last for you but I have my doughts. Have a friend this last week his started have the same probleum so I told him he had better send it in.,1,0,847

A3IR93YY0LEIWR,0,I wish Logitech would produce a USB version of this trackball.  This trackball is the best pointing device Ive ever found.  I have to clean it maybe once a year and it only takes about ten seconds.  It is extremely ergonomic.  The ball moves very smoothly with your index and pointing finger.  I prefer a lesssensitive motion so the ability to use two fingers vice one thumb allows for fast controlled movement when desired.  You dont have to u0026quotclimbu0026quot the case to get at the ball and you dont have to break your wrist angle either.After seeing the new trackballs out there I wonder if the new trackball designers have ever used one.,5,1,647

A3IRT6LX40LFBV,0,This pack of chargers make my life so much easier. I dont have to worry about remembering to grab my charger when I leave the house because I have one in my travel bag. one in my car. and one in my desk at work. in addition to the one that came with my phone which is permanently plugged in at home. So. if my battery gets low I can charge it regardless of where I am. It fits my Droid Incredible very well.,5,1,407
A3IS1SJA5IQZHK,44,This is our second Sony shower radio.  The first succumbed to steam in the bathroom after only a few months of use.  It sat on the sink several feet from the shower.Honestly. I would not have purchased a second one but my wife really wanted another for Christmas it seems to be the best shower radio in this price range.This time. however. Ive used a large ZipLock style bag to cover it. sealed about 95 percent. with only a slight opening for the suctioncup antennae to poke through.  It sits in a shower organizer mounted behind the shower head and gets splashed on frequently.  Thankfully. the controls are still quite easy to view and use through the bag.  With this much protection. Im expecting it to last much longer. If it doesnt I will definitely update this post.,4,1,773

A3IV6OOQH6LZ54,0,I had used a paper planner for years before switching to the Palm V.  I swore that I did not need one and that the paper planner was all I ever needed.  Then one of my friends got one and I saw how useful it was for  him.  I made the switch and I cannot say that I regret it.  The Palm V is  great!!  It tracks everything I need addresses. appointements. emails.  todos. and it fits in my pocket!!!!But what really sold me on the Palm  V was the rechargeable battery  I debated between the Palm IIIs and the  V.  But when it came down to it I figured that if I was going to be using  it a lot that the rechargeable battery was a good idea.I would recommend  this product to anyone that uses a paper organizer to organize their life.  If you dont use any organizer right now then chances are that you will not  get the use out of the product that the rest of us do.  Definitely a must  have for those of us that like to organize our life.,5,1,937
A3IVIS1OPYUU0X,22,When the Microsoft mouse on my old computer decided to occasionally register just vertical movement. I wanted a replacement that was cheap and convenient.  Amazons online shopping took care of the convenience. and their low price didnt cut into my budget for a whole new computer system.Micro Innovations specializes in lowcost peripherals.  You get what you pay for. of course.  As with my MI speakers .plenty loud enough. but no bass to speak of.. this mouse has limitations.  The plastic body isnt as smoothly sculpted as the Microsoft model it replaced.  And its symmetric instead of shaped for righthand use.  As others have pointed out. its smaller than average if youve got small hands. this could be a plus for you.The good news. its been working fine since I bought it.  Doing the job. and at a budget price. rates this item 4 stars.,4,1,842
A3IWSCI3KCL041,33,First off. for those of you buying this product expecting the eink experience. you are wrong.  This isnt an eink screen. if that is what you are looking for. go with .a. the original nook. .b. the kindle. or .c. any of the other eink dedicated ereaders on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers.The Magazine readerStudents with text books that have graphicsChildrens books with lots of picturesComic book readersIf you notice. these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics. which is something eink cant yet do!PRICEFor the price. you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality. though. with some technical knowledge. it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market .though it may void your warranty. so do it at your own risk..  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color. but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point. you are definitely getting a decent deal. though. you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note. you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market unlike the original nook. that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service. users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With todays cell phone technology. many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go when they are away from their home network.  Overall. this isnt a big deal to me. but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market. so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly. this device does run a little on the heavy side. however. I do believe that it is slightly lighter than its predecessor.  Still. for the ereader market. it is heavy.  For the tablet market. it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice. but as long as you arent trying to read while laying on your back. you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great. and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard .which is always annoying..This device also integrates with your facebook. twitter. and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market. but I guess you cant have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price. you are getting an underpowered tablet. but it still has access to the full internet which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader. which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as eink. but for the market it is being geared towards. you cant really complain about that!,4,1,4013
A3IX3M3SMKORSJ,1818,Bought this for work and have tried since to use it for personal use.  Unable to download audible.com or read any of the kindle books.

A3IY5Q5170K7L3,22,I cannot recommend a Nook tablet.  I have had difficulties loading sample books and  also books I have purchased.  One book I purchased would not load past page 22.

Beware.,1,0,357
A3IYYLA05O1TDY,0,I already had one of these camcorder when I purchased the one from Amazon and I have been very pleased with the one I already had. The problem with the one that I bought from Amazon was in excellent condition and a bargin for the price but I used it on a surveillance that was important but not critical and discovered that it would skip portions of the video as if it had a dead spot on the recorders heads. I tried running a cleaning head tape through it and it didnt clear up so this Camcorder may end up as a parts supply for my old worn out Sony.

A3J034YH7UG4KT,0,I got one of these before and they are really good.  I was going to get one at Staples but it was USD32.  I paid USD10 less for the same product. that is a good deal to me.,4,1,172
A3J054HK8N6KCU,11,First off let me say. this is pretty amazing for the price. especially now that the 8GB .expandable. is only USD129 at Bu0026N. Target. etc. I have it in the Snow color. Before this I had a Nook Color and it was just okay. I hardly ever used it. I would have given this 4.5 stars if possible. Whats keeping it from a full out 5 star for me is the lack of camera and video capabilities. I understand its main purpose is for reading but it does so much more than that .it has the Google Play store. and I use it for so much more that it just seems like a full on tablet to me and would be even better with a camera.At the time I was looking into buying one I found out that it has the highest resolution screen of any tablet this size. And. it is awesome. Streaming videos is great and playing games is a good experience. My son .3. loves to play games on this and it comes in handy when were out and about and he wants something to do. This is the perfect size for portability. Its also not too heavy when holding it to read or browse the web for longer periods of time. I havent set up a different profile for my son yet. which I should do. so I cant say for sure how well that function works. I have not had any issues with it so far and Im really enjoying it quite a bit. It still has all the nice features for reading books too .highlighting. dictionary. etc.. I just love it.,4,1,1379
A3J06KYNVP9I00,57,This product is awesome. I like the MP3 feature and the screen is easy on the eyes. so you dont need to purchase a light attachment when reading books in a area that doesnt have much light.  It does have some minor issues for instance no flash. websites like Youtube generates errors after viewing a video for a short period of time. Other than that. the nook color is a product I would recommend to my friends and family.  Its a more affordable way to get iPad features. on a budget price.,4,1,490
A3J1TK3HSL7YUD,23,I love this shower radio. I bought one 6 months ago and decided to buy a second one. The first is located in our shower area and the second one is in the bathroom dressing area.

A3J9GX2PN39W2U,11,My wife and I bought our L50 as a gift to ourselves around Christmas time. We had never owned a DVD player. but decided that it was time for a treat. Wow!I agree with all the positive comments here. My experience. with the heat issue. is that while you dont want the player in contact with your lap. a pillow or tableteop will do nicely.One complaint about the heat. though. is that as my unit heats up it starts skipping tracks and I can no longer follow a scene. Two things help remedy this. if you rent disks. always thoroughly clean your disks before inserting them. Get all the fingerprints and dust off. Occassionally youll find scratches. Ive found that using something like Pledge furniture polish helps a little .make sure you wipe the disk thoroughly. wiping straight out from the hole to the edgedont go in circular motions.. Be sure to look at the disks before you leave the rental store. Youll be surprised what scratches youll find. Second. instead of putting your unit flat on the table. find some way to keep it raised off the table by an inch or two so that air can circulate under the it. This will keep it much cooler and you can continue with your weekend movie marathon!The LCD screen *does* present a pretty small picture. and enlarging the move usually results in obvious pixelization at the highest setting. I usually just have the player stretch the movie borders to the left and right edges of the screen. Sure. it makes everybody look fatter. but the enlargement aids viewing without resulting in obvious pixelization. The picture is small enough that after 2 or three hours. youll be feeling eyestrain. But its large enough that you can make out most small details easily. On most movies it still passes my u0026quotcreditsu0026quot test .if you can read the end credits. the clarity is good enough to enjoy..Youll be impressed with the video output of this little guyeven if you dont have an svideo hookup on your TV. If your TV doesnt support SVideo. you might want to run out and get a better set!Ive found that the audio output is best enjoyed with headphonesbut thats mainly because my entertainment system is 7 years old and doesnt support Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. This little player will pump that outso if youre prepared for Dolby 5.1. youll be very pleased. Otherwise. invest in a good set of headphones that will either block out external sounds .by fully covering the ears. or by using noise cancelling technology. Youll appreciate the investment. In fact. you might invest in two of those headphones and a splitter while youre at it because you and your significant other will still want to enjoy this together!As for the audio splitter. get the splitter that is made of nothing but cables. The Y splitters that are all onepiece tend to cause the jacks in the unit to work loose after a while. .If you dont want to unwittingly trip over your audio cables in the dark. forget splitters and get a 900 MHz cordless headphones!.You might also find a car stereo adapter useful for road trips. Ill admit. it can be distracting hearing a movie all around you without being able to watch .if youre the driver.. butoh glorywhat a sound experience!One upgrade I was actually thinking about was the Sharper Image LCD goggles... but I actually wasnt impressed with the quality. .. sigh ..In the end. I wouldnt trade this puppy in at all. and I dont necessarily think Panasonics latest DVD miniature is an improvement.Regards.Rich.,5,1,3459
A3JA76B8NFTKIN,1819,Now. I have no problems with any discs or how it plays.. when it works. We bought our player in February from Circuit City since it was the only one that works with coax cable. and it worked fine for a month. We had a storm.  and it was unplugged before the storm since it was on the same surge  protector as my computer. When we plugged the player back in. the cable  went out. We tracked it down to the RF adapter. and replaced it. It worked  fine for 9 days. when the exact same thing happened. We did the same.  waited a week. and it went out again. This time when we replaced the RF  adapter. it didnt work. We sent the player in this time. and they  exchanged the unit. Another week goes by. and then the unit wouldnt even  turn on. We plugged it into other outlets. and it would click when we  plugged it in. but wouldnt turn on. We took it back in. went back the next  week. and they tried to give us a messed up unit .faceplate lose. unit  wobbles. drawer part way out.. We told them to try again. but we wouldnt  be back for 3 weeks .marriage. honeymoon.. Came back a few days ago. they  gave us the same unit with the drawer back in. and said to go down to the  service center to get the faceplate repaired. Circuit City said theyd  shore up the faceplate. but they arent authorized to do repairs. they have  to ship it to RCAs factory in Mexico to repair it .which is fishy. since  we get the units back in 1 week.. We call RCA to complain. they said that  Circuit City does the repairs. My advice is. do not buy any RCA players  from Circuit City.  My faith in both companies is gone.,1,0,1597
A3JCP5WCEURJE9,1414,A great bag for a smallmid sized digital camera.  I have the Olympus D490 Zoom and it fits perfectly.  The additional pouch holds my extra batteries and memory cards safely.

A3JCUU5D3TP1RX,33,Before I start. allow me to point out one thing. This cleaner is an ABRASIVE. That means that it repairs the scratches by rubbing them off. If you use it incorrectly. then it will create new scratches instead of repairing the old ones. Its not a problem with the product. its a problem with how youre using it.On to the review. The directions were straightforward. and it repaired minor scratches in one application. My CD had a few deep scratches on it. though. and the repair kit has been unable to completely erase those after 3 applications. Overall. a good repair kit. but not a miracle worker. It does what its advertised to do. no more. no less.,4,1,652
A3JCVWOZKNIPTR,33,I have used the internet extensively to research my  mini disc purchased and finally decided on the Sharp MDMS722.  The reviews I found at Amazon.com were very helpful to me and I LOVE this playerrecorder.  It is small. convenient. and the sound is excellent. .except for the headphones.  I use a pair of Sony headphones MDRA17.  The jog dial is very easy to use  and the instructions are easy to understand.  I have a Sony home mini disc  recorder at home and the controls of the Sharp are pretty close to these.  I have never had any trouble with using and editing the discs between these  two players.  The 50USD rebate really helped.  I read that the Sharp 702?  had had some trouble and sure enough. I found several refurbished models at  egghead auction.  They were selling for as much as I paid for the MDMS722  NEW!  Boy. it sure pays to shop around. Im glad that Amazon has a  forum for the consumer to share their real life reviews of products.,5,1,954
A3JD55EKK0KJKV,3636,I bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the TV based on our viewing angle.  In order to move it I had to loosed the screws each and every time.  I had it connected to a 27in vizio LCD which is pretty light.  Could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it.  Had to return,1,0,301

A3JETSX4R9X5CQ,0,This could be a good product because other HDMI cables Ive tried did not work with the Canon 7D and HD monitor. Its either the shielding on individual cables were not good or what on other cables. This one works just fine. The cable has good flexibility. Connectors fit well.One downside is the minihdmi connector is too delicate and was barely yanked out and broke.So if you have good hands and be careful. this one is cheap and it works.,4,1,439
A3JFK68JQD6QM6,0,I got this piece of crap. and its horrible. I immediatly returned it for the real palm keyboard. hey more expensive things. are usually better!,1,0,143
A3JFRYI1P4GY61,930,I use these batteries in my flashlight for completing preflight inspections of my aircraft in a combat zone. The flashlight draws a lot of power from the batteries to allow for the amount of light needed thus draining them rather quickly. This pack of 4 batteries and charger is a great deal based on the amount of money I was spending before I bought these rechargable ones. They provide a great lifespan and charge quickly.,5,1,425
A3JHBKWQWS36YL,12,theres not much choice for vhs tapes now. Im happy I can still find them on Amazon. I would give this a better rating if one of the tapes hadnt had a broken piece internally. I could hear it rattling and when I took the tape apart there was a piece snapped off. but they were cheap enough that I didnt bother to return the package.,3,0,331
A3JHFIG2ICLQVI,0,I love my nook reader.  I added a memory card.as I have a lot of ebooks.  What I like about that.is that all the covers come up without any problems.Its lighter than a lot of readers and fairly simple tofigure out.I wish it were a bit thinner. like my Sony pocket reader. as I have small hands.Also. I wish they had the plugin on top. instead of the bottomas sometimes I find it wears on my finger when I am holding it a lot.I actually dont use the touch part a lot. as the buttons are handy to push.I like that it has back and forward buttons on both sides of the Nook.,5,1,570
A3JHYJITP5MLTX,12,This device is worth every penny! I never had an error and I believe that anyone that got the UTOC error was in the very small minority.  PS Better for MP3 recordings than anything else!,5,0,186
A3JIWR69CBU30B,1313,This is the mouse that came with my computer. and it is absolutely terrible.  The mouse does not track well across the mouse pad. and it is VERY cheaply built.  Heres the real kicker. I have had this mouse for about a year. and suddenly the wheel is not working any more.  Tried reinstalling drivers. and it didnt work.  I guess I shouldnt be too surprised...,1,0,359
A3JJ2VBC9A41S4,0,This item was discribed as a new sony battery and had the picture of the exact oem sony battery.  I recieved a knock off brand yellowish in color no name battery.  the camera run slower with this battery.  I was in a pinch for a backup battery for a family vacation so i kept it. but it is very disapointing to recieve a product like this.  Should sell and send what you descibe and detail in your info and pictures.,1,0,416
A3JJI8JA892SOO,11,Bought for my wife and she enjoyed the ease of use including touch response. battery life and builtin dictionary.Only disappointment was inability to delete books from Nook unless connected to computer. Overall very satisfied.,5,1,226
A3JJMT5DZG8LC1,0,It didnt work.  My machine ejected it after about 3 seconds.  Its not the machine  which works fine and is relatively new.  IVE USED THESE IN THE PAST AND THEY WORKED AS THEYRE SUPPOSED TO.,1,0,189
A3JJZD5S08MU34,0,This product was exactly what I needed.  I have several zp 100 disks that I was unable to use. since my old drive stopped working.  The Iomega Zip 100 Portable USB Drive lets me use it on different computers.  Love it.,5,1,218
A3JK1D73B5KTJN,22,I bought the STRDE825 Sony receiver in 2000 and still havent figured out all of the unecessarily complicated scenarios! The unit sounds OK but lacks bass punch. If you like your music in flat response. this unit will suffice. Even with full bass and treble attenuation. EQ and bass boost. it still sound flat. The remote is even more of an operational headache than the receiver. When you press certain features. the remote and receiver exchange data and you may wind up with a deleted feature. The myriad of sound fields are useless to the average listener and could be replaced by simple treb. mid. and bass controls.,3,0,619
A3JL1YASPXQG5M,24,These were given as a gift.  The instruction manual is a general guide and contains no specifications particular to this binocular.The magnification of 16X is a nice idea. but too much to accommodate a steady image when using these handheld.  Without a very secure grip. it will be necessary to prop them or mount them via the threads at the front of the focus mechanism.  And as for mounting them. a center focus `wheel would be a superior option.I find focusing to be laborious.  When I need it. the center focus doesnt have a fine enough adjustment.  Just a hair one way or the other makes things fuzzy. and this makes synchronization with the diopter adjustment a meticulous process.  However. once focus has been achieved the image is sharp and clear.The exit pupil .which is a factor of about 3not 9.mm??. as indicated in the product descriptionmaybe they were referring to the relative brightness. is fine for daylight viewing but low for viewing dim astronomical objects.  Better lens coating would make them brighter. but you should still be able to note the four large Jovian moons and that Saturn has rings. as well as details on the surface of the moon.Overall. and aside of the price. I give these a 2.5 rating.  For me. ease of focus is an important feature in a binocular.  The magnification you want from these will be greatly offset by the wiggly image.  I will use them mounted. but will miss the grabandgo feature that makes a binocular appealing.  For that. a binocular of lesser magnification will always be my first choice.,3,0,1545
A3JMB5T5B198BC,1,The Motorola RFS radio operates fine. but the set up instructions are confusing.  The icons are not intuitive. there are too many options. the instructions are written by someone that never actually used the instructions.,4,1,221
A3JN8O6EIWIEN8,1,I purchased the Original Elph in 1998 and I must say this is the best camera I ever owned!  Ive never come across the dreaded u0026quotflashing Hu0026quot problem. but my flash gets stuck once in a while...I lost my Elph a couple of months ago. and am now looking to get another camera. but Ive decided to get my 2nd Elph!,4,1,322
A3JNLLJNREA367,0,I have had my color nook for three  months. Its fine for reading but the kindle is cheaper and the nook is  sure not a tablet. you cant get free apps. if you want an app from your tv station. guess what. if BN isnt selling it you cant  get it. thats why they sell these things . so you have to buy from them. I found free ebooks on the web. and down load to my pc as pdf files and drag them to the nook. ..... is very good. The  pages change size of their own freewill. which is very annoying. and the battery life is awful. if you use wifi you have to recharge every day. Yahoo mail is awful on the nook. gmail is fine and hotmail is too. As far as the web. email is all it good for. I wish I had bought and Archos tablet. all the things I am doing now plus a lot more.,3,0,770
A3JNVOV0L3UI0J,23,As a backup for when you are traveling in areas with spotty cellphone coverage this is a nice to have device.

A3JNXO0X2DYRR1,1,Tried it on three different computers. In most cases the computer didnt recognize the device. In the few instances when a computer did see the device.

A3JQPBWGWZQ8QR,0,It kind of worked in the first two months. with the hissing sound. However. I was able to deal with it. Then after the two months it started to get worse. louder hissing sounds. But. I was able to still use it with this annoyance. Now. it just doesnt work even with adjusting the wire. Its a piece of garbage and the music wont even come through the car speakers anymore. I wish I had returned it in the first month! Dont buy this!,1,0,431
A3JR2GDW7M1CNQ,11,Looks great but the controls are almost impossible to master. They make it incredibly difficult to program and it lacks features and functionality that it should have such as being able to select which cd track to wake up  to.,1,0,226
A3JRDL01WFNFHD,1010,The Midland 75822 is a great CB radio for a motorcycle.  It performs as well as some that cost a great deal more.  Its range is well suited for bike to bike communication.  I built a mounting bracket for my handle bar and mounted it there.  The radio being small was a good fit for that location.  I ran a power outlet from the bikes electrical system and hookedup an external antenna to the radio and it was ready for communication.,4,1,433

A3JSP1FOQ5IIZR,0,Besides having to plug it in to record and then unplug to listen. the only other problem Ive had with this mic is that it wouldnt work with my new iPod case. My new case is a hard snapon one that has an edge that comes right to the edge of the headphone jack. This prevented me from making a connection because the case kept the mic from being fully inserted. I discovered that this problem was easily solved. however. by grinding away some of the plastic on the mic so that it doesnt hit the case as badly. I just used a nail file to do this. and its barely even noticeable. Overall I am very satisfied with the excellent sound quality and wonderful price!,4,1,657
A3JSZ1FAXYINEL,11,I bought this print server for my office so I could send print jobs from either of our networked workstations to either of our printers without having to worry about whether a particular workstation was on .or working!..  Both machines are running NT4.0.I found the setup to be fairly straightforward  just follow the direction in the booklet.  To the other machines. the server basically looks like another computer with two attached printers which are shared.  After the install. each workstation must run the installation program to configure the machine to use the print server.  Each printer has a name which can be selected as the printer or default printer from a standard Windows print dialog.  We have used the server for a month with no problems.  Now I plan to get one for my house so I can print to printers from my laptop over a wireless LAN without leaving other machines on all the time.Apparently some of the reviewers did not check the manual on the CD to answer their problems. as I found full instructions to configure for UnixLinux computers.  Also. when the server has been set up. there is a web browser based administration utility.I didnt give the box 5 stars because there doesnt seem to be any way to remove a printer once it has been installed. other than to reset the box.  If I could add another feature. I would include the capability to print using a USB connection from the print server to the printer.,4,1,1434

A3JT1X6SU1MYTP,12,The Mavica series itself hovers over the competition simply because of its rechargeable battery and floppy disks.  The truth is that this camera is all you need save for MPEG feature.  It has a number of special effects. a  great zoom feature. and sequence pics!  Heck. Ive just taken a picture  of the computer screen with it and it turned out great.  Word to the wise.  Make sure you avoid nighttime pictures with this camera...very frustrating.,5,1,447
A3JTWZNUVOL2K1,1515,Liked the reception of this vs. the Garmin unit I had previously. But soon learned that maps are the way to go. I upgraded to a Map330 soon after trying the 315.,3,0,161
A3JUAIWL571I2R,14,The only reason this doesnt get a 5 is because it isnt very loud.  I honestly didnt expect it to be. especially with a single speaker.Everything else works as advertised.  I can get TVAMFMWeather stations well.  The old Curtis shower radio I had was very spotty.  Digital tuning is awesome.  The old one was analog and a real pain to lock on to stations that had a great signal.  The presets work wonderfully. and the timer feature was an added bonus.Only time will tell if it lasts though.  The Curtis died after a year and a half.  If the Sony lasts that long I will be more than happy.,4,1,588
A3JVB0IK3I8TEP,0,I love it. A great product. Worth every dime with one big u0026quotbutu0026quot that drops me to 4 stars.. The software and information provided is very bad.  Both incompete as well as hard to use.  The Audio Manager software  shipped with the Rio never did work fully for me. I tried on two different  machines.  There is no way to even understand some of the Rio500 features  from the material shipped. or from their web site. Although eMail questions  are answered in about 24 hours. after a week of ongoing frustration I  discovered MusicMatch. I tried Real Jukebox. but suggest downloading the  free version of MusicMatch software from MusicMatch.com to use for  downloading files and for ripping CDs for use with the Rio500.  I found it  to work intuitively and easly almost from the beginning.  You will also  need to down load the free plug in from MusicMatch to enable downloading to  the Rio device. After installing Jukebox. then go to the Jukebox tab on the  website. then to plugins. I will cheerfully upgrade MusicMatch and send  them my money even though the free version is fully functional and more  than satisfactory.,4,1,1135
A3JW3MG3B3HP0I,11,I followed the directions on the package.I ran the tape through a few times cause the film on a VCR cleaner is short then I repeated the directions again cause I still couldnt see the picture. this time I ran the tape through 4 or 5 times maybe 6...lol. after that I put a tape in u0026 the picture is as clear as it was when I brought this Emerson VCR years ago......Dont mind all the clicking u0026 clacking you will hear its just the side effects of the cleaning process...lol.u0026 when the tape is through running the VCR will cut off so dont be alarmed just cut it back on u0026 rewind the tape then eject it.,5,1,615

A3JZ2QZFD8KHM5,0,This battery does not last as long as the original Motorola Battery.  I purchased this mainly as an extra battery and it is great for that.  If I have a busy day. or am out of town.

A3K0DO82ZFWZYC,1,I got this as a  birthday gift from my kids. I was really excited to get a reader but because of some diabetic retinopathy I couldnt read it well. I need something with a backlight. I tried to take it back to Barnes and Noble to purchase a more expensive one that I could use but as always they were not willing to help me. They are the worst at customer service I have ever seen. I wont buy anything from them ever again. They are just unwilling to help. They always have a very lame excuse. Ive asked my kids not to buy anything for me from them every again. I sure wont. This NOOK is of no use to me at all. its not easy to use or easy to read and I just wanted to trade it in. pay more for something I could use but they said sense I had opened the package and tried to use it that I could not return it. Now I have a NOOK that is of know value at all to me and a store that is unwilling to help me in any way even though I had a receipt and an unused product. I will buy product from Amazon because they are so good to support their customers but I wont buy any product that is a Barnes and Noble. product at all.,1,0,1118
A3K1WN529ZV5HB,25,Bottom line. I am a grandma. A real grandma.  I got the Nook as a gift because I read a lot. I enjoy it tremendously for books. magazines. newspapers. Games too. But. the charger and cord ARE JUNK.  Total junk. I am into buying two at a time now. I dont jump up and down. just sit in my recliner. The plug end .mini usb. is the worst. My husband has used glue. electrical tape. and whatever to salvage this most recent one.  Poor poor quality on the charger and cord. There has to be a better way.,4,1,497

A3K21U8S3JDAJE,513,This is a fine device until you plug it into a 220v power supply somewhere outside the US.  Obviously I didnt read the fine print on the plug before doing this but it is hard to imagine a company producing a product for  people that travel that cant work all over the world.  No problems with my  laptop or cellphone .Toshiba u0026amp Nokia..  They are global competitors.,3,0,372
A3K2TT20PHF1EJ,4452,The  charger arrived broken. the adapter was in 2 pieces. so I would consider that an inferior product it was unusable,2,0,118
A3K2ZPES7B5A8U,0,I thought I would hate reading books on anything that wasnt a book before I looked at the Nook. It isnt backlit like computers. so it doesnt cause headaches as it does for many to read on computers its more like reading a book. Its more convenient. however. because the pages dont turn of their own accord when it is set down. and it is lighter than a book. In addition. though many ebooks are sold at the same list price as the book itself. the Barnes u0026 Noble site allows users to download many free ebooks in addition to buying. This is a spaceefficient way for those who read many books to own books it is not necessary to have walls of bookshelves. because the Nook holds many digital versions of the same books which one could buy in a physical form. There are. of course. issues with it. as there are with any form of technology. The fact that it runs on battery leaves one in danger of running out of power in a place without a charger. In addition. the screen occasionally freezes. requiring the manual shutdown of the device to return it to normal. These. however. are not major detriments when compared to the massive gains. The Nook is definitely worth the money. even though it costs considerably more than a book would.,5,1,1236
A3K3A19YQTTAH1,34,I only have my NOOK for three weeks. but Im very happy with it. Already read four books on it and it reads just as easy as a paper book. Battery lasted only three weeks instead of two months .but depends on the amount of pages you turn. and I turned quite a lot of them p.. but the battery is charged within three or four hours.so no big deal. Nice. light weighted. compact ereader. with good screen and enough options to change font.font size. etc. Also very quick delivery to Europe with Amazon .within a week!.. Good price vs. quality. For Europeans. dont buy the extra adapter. because its American only and its easy to charge via pc. If youre looking for an alternative to paper books. this is a great device. I also bought a NOOK cover from Bu0026N. very pretty. but a little expensive I think. the back crinkles very quick and it takes a while to ship to Europe.,4,1,869
A3K433N11R3HJ8,1,This device works with Windows 98 .Windows ME with a download from the manufacturers web site.. Macintosh is also supported. It can only capture 160x120 mpeg video on Windows.

I found the software rather inflexible. and I wonder why they support a higher capture rate on Mac than on Windows.,2,0,401

I lost some priceless live recordings by putting my master minidisc into this deck.The Sharp customer service representatives were rude and did not help or offer to replace this deck even though countless online reviewers have had the same experience. Its obviously a fault in workmanship and Sharps unwillingness to replace this piece of junk has convinced me never to buy another product from them.I would rank it zero stars if I could.,1,0,591
A3K6AP18O0N7QB,11,These are the best batteries that I would put into my expensive high powerd flashlights. This is my Second set that I have purchased and I stand firm behind this product.

A3K7A4GPMV3C22,12,I have been using Belkin Cat5 cables for a long time.They come with a stamp and specs on the wire and the connectors have a Belkin logo embedded in them.The one i received does not have the Belkin name anywhere on the wire and the connectors.Sure its a fake.If i had to buy any Cat5e i could have spent only USD10 including shipping.May be this fake cable works good. but the seller should not deceive people by saying its a Belkin cable.Buyer beware.,1,0,451

A3KB1RMX5UXEEV,23,This product does work well in removing fingerprints and preventing skips but it recommends replacing the cleaning pad after 30 cleanings. or sooner if the pad looks dirty.

A3KJ6WC71CI6VP,0,Pros. TINY SATELLITES satellite speakers the smallest Ive seen. comparable to Bose. without the Bose price. GOOD PRICE You have to look very hard to find a system like this with a powered sub for the same money.  EXCELLENT DEEP BASS powered subwoofer cranks. Hope you dont have any  downstairs neighbors! COMES WITH SPEAKER WALL BRACKETS dont discount  this! Many home theater systems dont come with these and you can pay 50USD a  pair for wall mounts. if you can find some that fit your speakers.Cons.  DOESNT COME IN WHITE Why are white speaker systems so hard to find? OK.  this is a minor point. but if JBL is going to make the spkrs so tiny. and  youre going to the trouble of installing this system. why not go all the  way? LACKS MIDRANGE with the tiny satellite size comes a compromise in  midrange sound reproduction. SATELLITES HAVE SPECIAL SPEAKER WIRE PLUGS so  if you are not going to use the speaker wires that come with the system  .and they are kind of small gauge. you will have to do some splicing.

A3KLL8F2CKW35L,0,This is probably one of the best MD players available here in the states.  I got mine several months ago and its still in great shape.  I dropped mine on accident a few times. but it still works fine.  Its very durable.  Also. the sound quality is almost exactly like CD quality.  The difference  between them is so small. you wont even tell the difference.  The maximum  volume isnt that loud. but thats not really a problem.  Recording stuff  is so easy. anybody can do it.  The battery lasts pretty long as well.  Id  say that you wont need to replace it for quite awhile.  Most of the  functions are similar to CD players .e.g. repeat. bass boost. etc...  But  allowing you to name your MDs and the tracks is very nice.  Since the cost  of MDs are cheap. you can store hours and hours of whatever you want on  them.  I only have a few gripes about my MD player though.  First. the  buttons on the player can get worn out a little if you push them too much.  Id recommend getting a carrying case with the player if you buy it.  With  it safely in the case. you can use the remote to control most of its  functions.  That way. your player wont look so worn out.  Next. the  headphones you get with your player are junk.  Itd be better if you got  your own.  Also.  I thought this player would be an exact copy of the  Japanese version. but it wasnt.  The Japanese version is more silverish on  the outside. and so is the remote.  But these are only minor things that  annoy me.  Overall. this player is one of the best you can get for the  price offered.,5,1,1556
A3KLOB3C0SPL3A,1617,this is not the RCA 72887 radio.It is the RCA RP7887.which is a newer and priced cheaper model.I received the RP7887 radio.when i ordered this radio.the original superadio model 72887 was made by GE.RCA bought the electronic division from GE.and they make the same radio under the RP7887 model number.If you want a great radio.buy the RP7887 model from this site and you will save a fortune in cost and shipping,5,1,411

A3KOAIRG0CC0NR,45,Im actually a bit shocked. Ive been using this cassette adapter for the past two years. The sound quality is good. although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes. The cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well. In cold weather. it sometimes sticks a bit. But overall. it has worked quite well. I dont leave my mp3 player in the car. so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging. It managed to last 2 years. which is excellent considering how quickly 8mm stereo cables can develop shorts.,4,1,557
A3KOWA9K2XW90E,45,I beta test software. I have been on 3 of the 4 listed below betas. The card has always preformed even under the beta operating systems.This is the only card I install. it is one of the most compatible cards I have ever seen and I have tested this card on Windows 95.98.98se and Windows ME* without any hitches so far. if you are looking for top performance for a low price this is the card. it is very compatible with all systems. a very user friendly card. you may want to check out their hubs too. very affordable.*note* Windows is a register trademark of Microsoft. Im not indorsing it but merely using it as a compatibility reference,5,1,638

A3KQ0XLKNINQY2,2,I decided to purchase this radio to replace my 20 year old Superadio II I use at work. It was not what I had expected. My old Superadio II had excellant FM reception where I work but this radio seems to be u0026quotnoisyu0026quot with more background interferance. Dont get me wrong...this is a great radio if your outside or a fan of talk radio. This would make a great pool radio...but thats not why I bought it...Im returning to Amazon and sticking with my old Superadio II till something better comes along.,2,0,511
A3KS6CBMY15DT7,1013,Nice radio with many features. This CB has OK performance as a handheld. .as most handheld CBs do. but is much better when used with an external antenna. I reccommend the portable magnetic mount type.  It can be moved between vehicles with ease.  I know GMRS  FRS handhelds have more range. but CB has made life easier on the road when I can get the attention of a semi to let me squeeze into a slowbusy onramp.  Also great for traffic updates on the spot. If you do alot of road trips or family travel. this radio along with a good radar detector makes long trips much easier. MG.,4,1,581
A3KSDF3A05PXJ7,12,This is a versatile charger that charges all standard size NiMH and NiCads. and reliably. I have used it for a year with no problems. a good value for the price.Smarter chargers have been recommended here.at about three times the price. to compensate for some of the issues with notsosmart but less expensive chargers like this one. I must admit. the information provided by Energizer with this charger doesnt help to understand the limitation of this fixed time charger.It will put 430MilliAmps for 5 Hours into a AA NiMH. 430Ma times 5 Hours = 2100MaH. It uses 370Ma in its NiCad setting for 3 Hours = 1100Mah for AAs. Since there is always some existing charge left in rechargeables before recharging. if your NiMH AAs capacity is less than 2500Mah.typically yes for AA NiMH. they will be fully charged by this charger. Likewise. NiCad AAs less than about 1200MaH.typical for NiCads. your batteries will be fully charged.You can use the information above and the charging currents given on the Spec Sheet for this charger to figure charging capacities for other size and capacity batteries. C and D size capacities greater than 30000MaH will not be fully charged in one 5 hour cycle and will have to be cycled twice.2 X 3000Mah = 6000Mah.or more times. unless left in the charger to trickle charge for a long period of time.a good idea in any case to top off all charges.. Every 24 hours of 65ma trickle current will add another 325MaH charge to a C or D cell till it reaches its full rated Mah capacity. Trickle charging batteries by leaving them in the charger after the timed charge cycle .5 hours on NiMH setting. 3 hours on NiCad. will keep your batteries topped off to full capacity at all times without hurting them.So. this charger is a good value if you understand what it does and and does not do. Those with less knowledge or time. but more money. may want to buy the more expensive Smart Chargers others have mentioned here. The Vanson would be my choice. a very good value. I have derated this charger because of lack of information provided to the consumer by Energizer on its site and on its Spec Sheet for this charger. Theyre not alone in this department. but there is still no excuse for this.If you really dont need a Universal.all battery types charged. then you can get a Smart AAAAA combination charger for much less. I would recommend the RipVan Lighting 4000N at RipVan100.Com. It charges fast but gently.doesnt overheat batteries. a life killer..Hope this has helped everyone. Rechargeables are the only way to go for saving you gobs of money and the environment gobs of abuse. Buy good high capacity rechargeables. like highly rated Energizers. and buy a good charger that will treat them right for you. Noooooo overheating by cheap Quick Chargers.,3,0,2777
A3KSID0WUMUHZG,7879,As long as you know how to use a level. a stud finder. a drill. and a wrench you can easily install this mount.  After shopping around at a whole bunch of stores I realized that you couldnt find one for this cheap. so I picked it up and was amazed with how well it was constructed.  Just a note. having 2 people help a lot just to making lining up parts easier.,5,1,361
A3KSN8MO6XMCWG,0,I was quite excited to acquire the PVDV910. until I discovered 2 major u0026quotproblemsu0026quot. the camera has no input device .i.e.. if you want to translate your VHS into digital. tough luck.. and most ridiculous. the unit  shuts off every few .short!!!. minutes. so that when you record. and stop  for a while. waiting for the best shot. the camera shuts off automatically.  and by the time you reboot. you have lost a valuable shot.,2,0,439
A3KTB7CY8PDGMQ,1616,These cables will cost between USD4050 at your local stores so at USD12. you cant beat it. It came in the retail packaging and not loose as seen in the picture.

A3KTQVAKAX4JTK,45,I just bought this nook today and so far I like it. Its not bad for the price. Its not as good as the ipad but if you arent going to do much with the ipad you might as well get the nook. I suggest getting it through barnes and noble. its cheaper.,5,1,246

A3KYC5F6BSQVQL,0,I purchased the Reading Pen as a gift for a Shanghainese advanced student of English. but couldnt resist an extended tryout before sending it to China.  As a device that makes the complete transition from the printed  page to the pronounced word. and then to simple. easilyunderstood  dictionary definitions. the pen is an ideal product for someone learning  English who starts from a very different native language and writing  system.  Another potential audience would be individuals with dyslexis.  since phoneme recognition is accomplished accurately.  The pen recognized a  variety of fonts and type sizes. including allcaps and italic. but was  less accurate in reading handlettering.  It required repeated attempts at  recognition for about 10% of words. but second attempts were usually  successful.  I found it easy to learn to use .I never did view or listen to  the instructions..  Use of the pen does require a bit of patience and  manual dexterity. but motivated users should be able to overcome this.  The  vocabulary seems large enoughI didnt encounter any words it didnt  recognize. though admittedly I didnt turn it loose on William Buckley.  Improvements I would recommend include increasing the speed of word  recognition .this would be great for older students with dyslexia who would  use it as a reading aid. and if possible. making it easier to scan .so  young children could use it..,4,1,1407
A3KYSX99TTK4AQ,2627,This is a great product. i really liked the style of product. It had real nice sound quality. and the base was good .i love it if the base is good.. I gave mine to a REALLY good friend of mine. i wish i had kept it.,4,1,215
A3KYYFT538CZ0O,24,As a network administrator in an enterprise enviornment I agree that generally you wouldnt use this card in a corporate enviornment.  But large companies buy products in bulk and they get the deals that the everyday user doesnt get.  But. in all honesty you could probaly run this card with no problems on an enterprise level network  the performance is great especially for USD15.But for general networking in a medium sizedsoho enviornment you cant beat it.  This card seems to work with every system I have installed it on  no matter the platform or OS.Its cheap. well documented. and easy to install.  Is there anything else really to say?,5,1,643
A3KZ0XE67RHGQ3,22,.Husband writing review.. Needed a good security cable to secure a home theater I installed at our new fraternity house. and this one fit the bill.

A3L07Z1NOJNZ8A,0,The icy blue color gives it a great look.  I like having the volume controle next to the headphones.  The only problem that I have with it is that the headphones are a bit fragle.  The part that keeps the ear pice in  place snapped off on both sides.,4,1,250
A3L09N0Q1U3OGG,1213,I used my diamond rio. but was upset that it is not compatable with all my old cassette tapes.  This is a major flaw. because I have some really nice tapes that I was unable to listen to.  There are ways to get around this  problem though. I highly reccomend that you duct tape the rio to a good old  sony walkman. and groove out that way.  This also allows you to look more  down to earth. rather than have people get MP3envy over your compact  MP3equipment.  .Dont try sticking the rio inside of your walkman and  closing the walkmans door it will break the tape spindles of your  walkman..64 megs is better than a 60 minutes tape. but you cant flip  the chip.,3,0,662
A3L0MJRC1Y02XP,217,I have really enjoyed my subwoofer....when it is working!  About a year after purchasing it. I had the same problem with the amplifier blowing and it was fixed under warranty.  About a year ago the speaker sounded like it was blown and I discovered the plastic gasket or casing that holds the speaker in place broke and I will have to replace the woofer to the tune of 80.00 just to fix it.  For now I have been keeping the volume down. but it only vibrates on really loud rumbles.  Conveniently. there are no service centers in Northern California I cringe at the thought of giving them 80 more dollars....grrr,2,0,611

A3L2CJYUMLEX67,1,I used this camera once and it took relatively good pictures.  However. on  my next trip. the cameras internal memory stopped working .this is a  problem that other people I know have had with the camera..  Worse than the  cameras malfunction. however. was the companys refusal to service the  camera under warranty.  Moreover. when I sent the camera back. they refused  to write a letter justifying the lack of service.  I would not buy a piece  of Canon equipment.  Save some money and buy an Olympus Stylus. which has  served me quite well.,1,0,543
A3L2SBZCBHQAZ6,4854,This is a great cover as I love the feel of Moleskin notebooks. The design is probably better for lefties but I enjoy have a pad handy for note taking. The only reason i did not give this 5 stars is because I can not find the refills listed on amazon. You think it would be listed under the people also bought page but its not.,4,1,327
A3L4230P7SY1G7,35,bought my first superadio in 1983 at a cost of more than the new ones go for.  it to was sloppily built.  but hey. it still works good.  a few years ago the sound got really bad.  i took off the back cover and found the nuts holding the big speaker had come loose.  tighted them up. put a blob of whiteout on the nut and screw. and no more problem.  bought a new one last year when amazon offered free shipping.  the station pointer didnt agree with station listened to.  off came the back cover. and i moved the pointer to the correct spot on the dial relative to the station being listened to.  problem solved.  perhaps they are built so sloppily because there is no compatetion. not from sony nor panasonic.  no other portable radio ive listened to  has big speakers. excellent sound fidelity. and super reception.,5,1,817
A3L5B2171163EV,55,I bought this item and simply plugged it into the parallel printer port on my printer and then into a USB port on my Dell Studio XPS 9000 running Windows 7. Windows recognized the printer immediately and automatically installed the printer driver. without my having to do anything else. When I went to Devises and Printers on the Control Panel. my LaserJet 4 Plus showed up as a functional printer .after a 30second delay.. I was then able to print a sample document. No fuss. no problems.After it was all installed. I noticed that it came with an instruction booklet and a little CD. I didnt need to use either.,5,1,612
A3L5GRJ5I310VC,22,Im pleased with the Grundig 960 my wife and son gave me for Christmas. No. it doesnt have quite the reception ability that my Grundig u0026quotYachtboyu0026quot does. but it does pull in a good number of shortwave  stations. both foreign and domestic. And it really dresses up the room. It  also makes a portable CD player sound good when plugged in. My only  complaint is that the tuning knob is a bit stiff. Otherwise. this is a  u0026quotkeeper.u0026quot,4,1,457
A3L5TQ7JUPZP3Z,2627,I purchased this unit about two weeks ago in FLA. Needless tosay the lip sync problem never appeared and the serial number andfirmware confirm that I am safe!  The image on this puppy is abolutely amazing. You should use component connections to really appreciate the video quality. I already have a dolby decoder on my amp but the audio has greatly improved with this player. The features are awesome .gotta love being able to load an image as your default screnn.. Overall. topnotch player for a decent price. I highly recommend it!,5,1,534
A3L60UJZQ0O0R5,34,This was a good starter card for watching television through my computer. It worked well with Windows 98. but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century. youd find yourself out of luck. Initially. with 98. I thought very highly of the TV Wonder. However. upon upgrading to Windows 2000. I had to download extra drivers from ATI which ended up locking up the computer after watching TV for more than a few minutes. After that. I thought XP would handle it a little better. Unfortunately. it was worse. I couldnt find any software support from ATI that would coexist with Windows XP. and have yet to.In retrospect. I probably should have gone with the TV Wonder VE which is compatible with Windows XP after downloading an updated driver from ATIs site.,2,0,788
A3L76RW9MBYJ84,0,Yes. this unit does work remotely  provided you have good coordination and a long stick!  It would only u0026quotlearnu0026quot one of my AV device remotes .all happen to be Sony..  To Amazons credit. they are selling at a price USD... less than the competition. which makes it competitive with other nonremote .get up off your behind  walk over  push the button. type switches.

A3L8CZT6T4K4PC,0,As two previous posters have mentioned. theres a problem with this product  theres no template readily available for their use. The packaging directs you to a Memorex site that is defunct. You can search and find a thirdparty program that promises it will do what you need. while also installing potentially harmful adware on your computer as well. I would not install it as it seemed unsafe. I tried contacting Memorex. but go no response. This left no real options for their use.I needed to print my inserts ASAP. though. and didnt have time to find something else so I divised a template of my own  with trial and error. it worked. more or less. It was VERY time consuming. though. Memorex should pull this product off the shelves if they arent going to legitimately support it.,1,0,781

A3L9NGPTBJBQEL,0,Aside from various problems with this since the beginning. now I have to charge this Nook every time I want to read. It is said to hold a charge for 8 weeks with the wifi off. but even if I only read for 10 minutes. the next day I have to charge it again because the battery is too low. Ive tried 3 different chargers to no avail. Instructions say to leave the Nook on when not in use. so I do. Its absolutely maddening when I return home from a stressful day of work and just want to sit on my porch to read for a while to unwind and get some cool air  but no. I have to charge the fricking Nook AGAIN and cant use it outside until its been charged for a long time  and then have to deal with this frustration the next time I want to read.This Nook is crap and the service by Barnes u0026 Noble and the seller were both zero  no service whatsoever. with each party passing the responsibility onto the other.Also. why is it that although the Nook screen or buttons often have to be pressed very hard to turn a page. when the Nook is closed to carry to my car or somewhere the slightest pressure changes the page or screen so I have to remember or write down what page I left off at???This Nook takes all the joy out of reading.,1,0,1227

A3L9Z3K1H3GYX9,11,I bought my Tripad last year and at the time it was my sole computer for PIM. Internet word processing. Unfortunately a good concept in  design is let down by soso software and slow proceesing. 70Mhz was slow even for its time what with the Jornada 820 at 190Mhz. Most applications tend to hang if too many are opened simultaneously and Sharps machine does not contain most of the goodies that are standard with the vadem clio. Lastly the machine weighs a ton and the only person who could use this machine on the fly would be jesse ventura or hulk hogan.  On the other hand it has a tremendous wow factor. ipaq notwithstanding. both a pcmcia and a cf slot and although you cannot install the microdrive it has enough room for memory expansion. a StrongARM processor with 206 Mhz. 64 MB RAM.

Bottom line. if Panasonic does not want to  admit that there is something wrong with their player. make sure you buy  your player someplace where you can return it .not get it repaired  can  they be repaired? ..  I bought mine at Sears.  3 months later they  exchanged it with no problem!  Let Panasonic get the broken ones back!  I  move up my rating because it is a good player.

A3LIQ5Q290D32Q,78,I do not understand why this bag is on the C3030s list of accessories. Its to small for C3030. I bought it. hardly could  squash  the camera. than forgot to send it back. Just a warning for others .....,2,0,202

A3LJWCYPDRM375,0,In retail stores. Tz tapes are quite costly. Amazon had the best deals so far. Better yet.I also qualified for free Su0026H!,5,0,124
A3LJYCUO12B9TZ,13,I bought one of these solely to hack it and use it as a cheap tablet.  I had low expectations its less than half the cost of an Ipad or Tab after all.  As it turns out it runs really well once you get it going. The performance is surprisingly snappy and responsive. The only real hiccup is the mediocre video support.  There are some UI hits too since he version of Android its running is not tablet optimized.  If youre not afraid of voiding your warranty. this is the best bang for your buck as tablets go.I configured it so I could easily switch back to the default Bu0026N configuration.  Which. to my surprise. Im using a lot. The ease of jumping in and out of a book makes me more likely to read. Its an LCD so you might get some eyestrain. but the viewing angles are amazing. the best Ive seen on a handheld device. The childrens books are great too. although a bit expensive.  The magazine view is awesome too. it lets you keep up with your mags without killing trees.  The newspaper view is less impressive.  Its basically like Google reader with a fee.  Note that the Nook reading app that comes with the Nook is different than what you can download fro the Market and is much better.As for downsides. there arent a lot.  The battery could be better as it typically only lasts a few days between charges under periodic reading and browsing .a couple of hours a day..  Watching videos kills the battery really quickly.  The speaker is on the back of the unit. so forget about setting it down when watching videos or anything with audio.I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a dedicated reader or a cheap tablet.  Its a nobrainer for anyone looking for both.,5,1,1682
A3LMCVYCG6JO7C,34,Love the concept.  Love the transportabilty. BUT onehour...means more like 30 minutes AND after you download 50 songs theyexpect you to pay .from there software providermusic match. for adding other songs to your play list.  I am sure there are ways around it. but who wants to spend the time figuring it out?  I want ease and Daimond is not making it easy!  I own stock in the company and am really annoyed that they expect me to pay after I forked over the cash for an over priced piece of...  I will get around it because I grew up on computers. but WHY make it more difficult for me so that I am DRIVEN to write a BAD review at amazon.  I made an effort to write this review so that the comapny will make a change.  Simply...I want to hear a song right now. but because my roommate is sleeping and I USED up my 50 songs I would have to make an even BIGGER effort than signing on and spending 10 minutes writing a NEGATIVE review to DIAMOND in hopes that they will make their product more USER FRIENDLY. When I paid USD150. I was not aware that the product ACTUALLY held only 30 minutes and I would be responsible for anything over 50 songs.  I want to feel at ease. in that I can recond ALBUMS and not be selective in songs.  DO SOMETHING DIAMOND OR SONY WILL TRULY MONOPOLIZE THE MARKET!,3,0,1292

A3LNPD5UWMBQJP,0,I bought this Nook tablet as a replacement for my Nook color that I loved but dropped.  Before going with the Nook I had tried 3 different eReaders with poor results.  The Nook is far superior to other eReaders I have used.  The tablet is very functionable with a quick browser and is easy to use.  Screen quality is excellent. videos are as good as my LCD TV. and there are several different settings to use while reading.  Battery life is very good as well. The only complaint is the speakers.  Even when the volume is as high as it will go. content is barely audible.  I use headphones instead when I need to listen to something. Other than that. no complaints.  Have reccomended this eReader to family. friends. and coworkers.,5,1,730
A3LO4IG4O4REVD,23,Used for a long road trip with 2 Cars. The Cord lenth isnt horrible. it was ok for my use but I agree... it could be longer. Overall for the 13 bucks I paid for a used one was worth it.,4,0,185
A3LOFKKMNZTJAF,11,I had this for approximately 2 years. It worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances. One day I left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour. During this period. the alarm was activated and I was embarrased to face my office workers. This is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm. I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months. it started the same problem.So. now I am afraid to use this security system with my laptop. But I did not face problems like changing the combination by its own. You can use it without the alarm activation .i.e. without batteries. but the cable is so thin. it is not recommended to protect any valubles.,1,0,778
A3LOTADKRVMU5L,820,This networking kit is easy to setup. and easy to run. Themanual and the software walk you through every little step of theway. After you setup the network you can share files.

I would suggest this system to anyone that has more then one computer in there home.,5,1,461
A3LP8I2TTS4D1I,23,One of the best things about the original Sony Walkman was how loud it was.  If you cranked it up loud enough. all noises were cancelled. even traffic.  Well. several years of litigation and psychoacoustic research later. the latest generation of portable audio players are downright pansy in comparison to Sonys first little gem.  To offset this MAJOR problem. you might consider a pair of NC headphones.  They work best with low. steady noises. like whatever that hideous noise on airplanes is. but are not especially good at shielding you from the screaming coming from the next room.  This model is not what I would call tough. as some key structural points are vulnerable. but it also isnt flimsy. and with a modicum of care. should hold up.  My favorite thing to do is turn them on with no music playing. then talk. and hear how the noise cancelling circuitry changes ambient noise Its a bit like being put in a glass jar.You wouldnt need these if you werent such a gimmick hound who had to have the latest and most quietist portable audio gear. but had stuck with your ..... walkman. or even better. your giant ghettoblaster.,4,1,1132

A3LQUEB84IR3VO,0,It works and it doesnt. The product itself works and yes it works with the Operating Systems but it didnt work for my needs. I had old floppies from and XP machine and wanted to get data back. With this I kept getting a message that there was no data on the floppy disks which I knew not to be the case .yes. Im aware of degradation of floppy drives over time.. I did some research and determined the issue was that the hardware is too knew so it doesnt recognize some of the older floppy disks.I managed to find an old machines with and internal floppy drive and did get the data off the floppy disks. All but 2 of the disks resulted in data retrieval. So while this actually works .drivers install. shows up as a valid drive. etc.. it really doesnt. Most anyone purchasing this is trying to get data off old floppies which this didnt do for me.,3,0,846

A3LSI1EPZ9AZC0,412,For me the most important feature is the pdf support and on that account. Nook wins. Its pdf support is much better than Kindle. supporting reflow. that way. you see the page as the native format with real page numbers. it is quite readable if your file is basically text. I dont know if Kindle has improved in this regard but when I bought and returned Kindle DX six months ago. this feature wasnt there and pdf looked more like an image than text. Even DXs large size did not help me read pdf books because it was small and dimmer than regular text. Now on Nook I can read them as though they are in native format. no conversion is needed. but again these are mainly textheavy pdf files. not complex. graphicheavy ones.second area where Nook is better is the screen clarity. the contrast between the background and the font is much better than my experience of Kindle DX.Third. user replaceable battery and additional memory slot is a plus for me as I intend to use the device overseas at some point. In case of a problem with the battery. international users have to send your Kindles to the United States for battery replacement? Nook replacement battery costs USD30.Fourth. a better looking device. I dont need the keyboard but it takes a significant space on Kindle 2. the LCD screen works fine but it reflects light and consumes battery when reading so this might not be necessarily a plus. perhaps a physical keyboard that can be separated from the device might do a better job.Fift. support for more file formats. particularly epub.Note. Nook is speedier than many reviewers here suggest. I suspect it is due to the new software update. I was able to swipe through pages with no difficulty.Kindle advantages.1. slightly cheaper with no tax and easy to return amazon.coms wonderful return policy. .so far I have bought hundreds of products on amazon. and returned only a few of them but the reason why I bought them here is because of the return policy. amazon.com is simply the best online retailer in the US with the best customer service.. BN will impose restocking fees if you have opened it. But BN offers some deals when you visit one of their stores if you live nearby.2. availability of international 3G support where you can buy books. Nook needs to catch up on this.3. better. usable dictionary. Nook dictionary is hidden behind a few clicks on the LCD which makes it really unpractical.4. its experimental browser which allows you to open other websites. I dont need a browser in a reader but in case of need it is a good feature.5. better ebook library. but BN is fast catching up and the ebook that I bought yesterday was cheaper at BN by four dollars. maybe thats an exception but deserves mention. but epubpdf availability on Nook makes it superior in my opinion. also. new devices such as Irex and Que readers will use BNs collection so more machines will be available. which will improve BNs economies of scale.To sum up. for me the dealbreaker was pdf reflow without conversion into native format. user changeable battery and additional memory slot. These features are available on Nook but not on Kindle. Nook should improve on user interface to rely less on LCD during reading .such as dictionary.. make LCD less reflective. international 3G access and ability to buy books. It is a fourstar device.Finally. kudos to Amazon to allow comments on competitor products. I did not see place on BN.com to comment on Nook. this means a much more interactive shopping experience on Amazon.,4,1,3509
A3LU4GCEEZGGSO,66,Great radio once hooked up to a half decent antenna. The handheld was mostly useless.

A3LUX2APCYYEX6,0,Love my nook.  It worked great.  Until I had had it 13 months.  Then it wouldnt take a charge and the screen would freeze when the battery was still full.

Im not going to pay 120.  for something with a non replaceable rechargeable battery that only lasts one year.,1,0,391
A3LVEZVL8KXVF9,0,This set was on backorder and it was well worth the wait.  Our current tv was in its death throes. When it finally arrived we were stunned as to its picture quality. We selected this model because of its high resolution  number. We have WEBTV.internet on tv. so we wanted a higher than average  resolution for viewing print and small images. WOW!  Next. we watched our  favorite video. TITANIC. Because of its high resolution it seemed to have a  3 dimensional quality. IT BLEW MY HAIR BACK!  I was sure at any moment I  would be hit by water from the North Atlantic. We are continually impressed  at the realism that this set gives to all our action and epic videos. I  have owned nothing but Toshibas and they have always been a superior  product so it was easy to make a selection. You cannot make a better  investment. It could possibly change the way you veiw modern television.  .just for the record. the tv that died was NOT a Toshiba.  It came with my  husband when we married.  Fortunately. he has lasted longer!.,5,1,1022

A3LZQZMCIZDXK3,3945,I bought my 8gb Bu0026N Nook new for USD149.99.  At USD200 list price I would say its a ripoff and Im still not thrilled that I spent USD150 on it.Pros.  Expandable storage via microsd.Reliably plays mp4 video and ebook files.Netflix and Hulu Plus apps are reliable and have good interfaces.Reliable .but not particularly longdistance. wireless antennae.Bright screen with good color. contrast. and resolution.Responsive touch screen.Good battery life.Cons.  Web browser is slow. unreliable. and crashes often.Limited. closed operating system with expensive applications.Headphone jack is lowrent  too quiet and scratchy with some of my speakers.Horizontal  Vertical screen calibration lacks enough customization options.Made from cheap plastic  microsd cover slot fell off.No way to rent movies or TV episodes from Nook store.Hardtouse music player that has problems playing some mp3s that other devices can play just fine.Its good as a potable media player but is definitely nerfed as a touchscreen portable computer. If other tablets were priced in the same USD150 range I would have rather got something a lot more customizable with access to free apps.,3,0,1157

A3M1XJWFFGDMOU,5,Ive had the CD cleaner for about 3 months. I was experiencing some problems with the player in my car. The CD player light kept indicating that a CD was in the player. even when there was no CD inside. I ran the cleaner CD two or three times. and it didnt help. Ran it a few more times .probably 1012. and the CD player started working. However. Im unsure whether the cleaner CD fixed the player or not. I learned that waiting to take the CD out until after the player has completed ejected it produced the same result. while jumping the gun and  helping  the CD out of the player produced the undesired result.One thing I really wished came with the CD was a clearer explanation of how it works or how to use it. The audio directions that the CD plays are pretty clear. but it took me a few times through to make sure I was doing it right. and Im a little bit concerned that if I left the player playing on the 2nd track .the one with the brushes. I assume. that it might damage my CD player. Not sure if Id recommend it to anyone else as more than a crapshoot.,3,0,1062
A3M3CZ0MVUOED0,0,This is the power cable I needed to use with my Desktop PC and it worked wonderfully. The fit on both ends was snug and secure.

A3M4PAIKT7GD5V,36,I found my Nook to be just what I was looking for. It is the perfect size and has a touchscreen that makes reading easy and fun. You can download over a million books for free from Barnes and Noble and you can download screensavers for it to personalize it. You can highlight words and bookmark your pages too. You can also change your font type and size.There is no glare on the screen and if you wanna read in the dark. simply buy a little book light for it. There is a glitch that causes the screen to freeze up occasionally but if you hold down the little n button at the bottom it fixes it every time. All in all this is a good little ereader. I love my Nook.,4,1,664
A3M57WSNELOE6P,23,Well. I cant say much because I havnt fully installed this alarm system but when I first recieved this package I thought of two things.1.

Its much more complex than it looks.It looks like something that has a few connections and boom. its ready.  Not at all.

A3M73KV733HBG3,1,Ive owned the Nook Simple Touch for about a year now and for the most part Im happy with it.  The rate it which the words draw on the screen is a little slow sometimes and about once a month it freezes up.  The only thing that unfreezes it is pushing the reset button for about 20 seconds.***Update*** About a month after the warranty expired. the screen froze up permanently.  I havent been able to figure out anything that will make the touch screen work again and when I called tech support. the only advice they could give me was to do a hard reset which isnt working to unfreeze the screen anymore.  When it worked. I really liked it.  I just wish that it still worked.,3,0,674

A3M9EQEY9RU59U,12,The Netgear EN104TP is one of the best products that I ever bought.  It does just about everything that more expensive 10100 Ethernet hubs do at a fraction of the cost.  If all youre doing is adding additional computers to your network. then the EN104TP is all you need.  I use it at my job. which is a company that sells greeting cards wholesale.I decided to get the EN104TP after determining that our Macintosh needed access to the .PCdominated. network so we could transfer and print TIFF and EPS files of artwork the company intends to sell.  Because of a lack of Ethernet outlets in our printing department. I decided the best and cheapest way to do that was by adding an Ethernet hub.  At first. I was a little skeptical about getting a 10 BaseT hub. but after finding the EN104TP on sale ...... I decided to take a chance. and it was worth it.  It transfers files easily. it facilitates network printing .allowing us to maximize resources. and. for the computers connected to the hub. uninhibited access to the Internet.Although this product is almost perfect. I encountered a couple of minor flaws.  Recently. due to a windstorm that blacked out most of Memphis. we had to move the printing operations to another location.  In doing so. I took the EN104TP in the hopes that it would function as a standalone Ethernet hub.  Although it worked the first day. it didnt seem to function any day after that.  Granted. I am not sure if it was the EN104TPs fault or the quirkiness of our computers which uses different Windows OSs .ME and XP..  However. we were able to piggyback on the network of the building we were working out of and everything was fine.  The other flaw is an obvious one. download speed.  I found that files downloaded through the hub took longer to finish than ones downloaded directly from our main 10100 hub.In summary. I must say that the EN104TP is a great product and a great value for people who want to expand their network without having to spend a fortune to do it.,5,1,1998
A3M9EQEY9RU59U,1215,I recently bought this radio so that I would have somethnig to listen to during a long work day.  When I got it. I was surprised at how small it was. which for me was good because my desk is oftentimes cluttered and I would have had a hard time placing a large item such as a boom box.  Size is also a key factor with regards to reception. which is the only reason why Im not giving it five stars.  Contrary to other reviews. I sometimes have difficulty receiving certain stations. and I often have to move the radio around my desk until I can find a spot where reception is good.  The poor reception may be due to the building were I work.  Soundwise. the radio is great. providing .when reception is good. great. clear sound. with little static.  I particularly like its performance at low volumes. which is a necessity when you have to share office space with others that doesnt share your taste in music.  In fact. I like this radio so much that I might buy another one for use at home.,4,1,990

A3MEIR72XKQY88,0,This camera takes okay pictures and its very easy to use. Dont be repulsed by other reviewers who doesnt know how to use the camera. just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  overpriced due to the zoom and floppy drive a 10x zoom .optical. with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom.2x optical and 3x digital. with 1280x960.  I dont like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media. because there are  different essentiel accessories that arent included in those prices.the  compact flash cards could make you say u0026quotAaaarrrrrggghhhh! I dont have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!u0026quot..At the end.  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures. but it  comes cheaper than other cameras. If you have a lot of money to invest.  dont buy this one. just buy the best camera with the best lens and dont  look at lower priced items. because quality is what you want.Last thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera. you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  pictures.Congratulations to those who bought mavicas.me!.!,5,1,1225
A3MEIR72XKQY88,2842,Im on a small budget this summer. so I bought this camera for fun. It doesnt drain your batteries before you even took a picture.I took about 40 pictures.without flash. with my cheap rechargeable batteries.. The four  stars missing is for the worst quality Ive ever seen in my life. I suggest  to never use the flash.all my pictures taken with flash were 90% full of  light. so its all white!.This camera is too cheap.I think that my  batteries heavier than the camera itself.You only have to put the Cd  that it comes with it and it installs itself.I think uploading my  pictures.16. to my pc took 4 minutes!The camera was too easy to use and  I wonder why Agfa made these things.Finally. digital cameras are too  expensive and someday the prices will fall down and camcorders will take  better pictures... you will regret buying this awful camera!,1,0,849
A3MEIR72XKQY88,2529,This is great for jogging and sports. but for most. an hour of music isnt  enough. If I added an hour more as in memory. it would cost me USD15064megs!

The size  made me realize to get it. but Im still using Cd players for the rest of  the day.

A3MF4B8ASAA496,0,These CDRs are not only cheap. they have amazing quality. I have recorded 17 songs onto one CD. and each one sounds as good. if not better than the original. However. some of this may have to do with the CD recorder. The  only downside to these CDs is the top of the disc. It has space for you to  write the title and contents of the cd. but it doesnt look very good. That  is a minor problem though and it doesnt subtract from the awesome quality  of sound these CDs put out.

A3MHOFE4HDHIGL,2,I love this radio.  I listen to the news every morning while I am getting ready for work and I listen to music when I clean the bathroom.  It is perfect if you need to have something to listen to like I do.  It is also very simple to operate and has a long battery life.  The only drawback for me is that it doesnt have a backlit LCD light which would be ideal for the dark and easier to see the clock.,4,1,402
A3MI3QBXP5I7FA,22,I purchased this item. then in afterthought read the reviews listed here.  So I was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it. and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob.  But the promise of awesome reception was all I needed to hear.First off. I work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference.  I needed something to get past that.  That was my only concern.  So it didnt much matter. as long as I could get past the interference.  Now that you know that. let me tell you about this thing.First of all its not HUGE.  Im 40 right now. so Ive seen rickety bulky radios that would kill if it hit you.  This is a nice unit. well sized for the speakers and antennas in it.Second. its very well built.  I tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect.  Even the volume. treble and Bass buttons nicely placed on the unit cant be removed without some extra tool.  The switches are only two function switches. and are well built.  Granted it doesnt light up. and the tuner bar isnt a lit bar. but who cares. its very well built.  I tried to squeeze the unit to see if I could make it crack. no. its sturdy.Now. for the TUNING ability.  There is a WIDE and NARROW switch. which can either give you a very narrow tuning area. or a much WIDER tuning area.  A station I listen to at 740am appears on the WIDE area from 700 to about 750 on the dial.  However on the NARROW switch. it only comes in within a few millimeters of where 740 is.  That explains why people say the tuning was so bad. they had it set to wide.So all things said and done. how did it do against the interference?  Now basically Im stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles.  The improvement was marginal.  BUT to my surprise there are additional AMFM jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to u0026ltGu003e  I grabbed a power cord. wrapped it around the AM port. and between the improvement in tuning. signal grabbing. and the extra antennae. Im getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissing.This is a very nice radio. well worth every penny I spent on it.  Hope this review helps.Ed Williams. Colorado Springs. CO,5,1,2256
A3MIJMRRB1UT4J,3234,We all know wireless speakers reputation... But when you are to install some kind of u0026quotsurroundu0026quot sistem in a room with lots of doors and dont want to place u0026quotmilesu0026quot of wire. this is your choice. They  work just fine. Not the sound for a preciosist fan. nor perfect quality.  It takes a while to align the sistem properly. but lesser than wiring your  entire place. I suggest to place the antenna the higher you can. Batteries  are the tricky thing. 8 AAs per speaker. quite a lot.  You can plug them in  if you get 12V adaptors but theyll result more expensive than the  speakers!  So. if you expect reasonable quality sound .meaning no WOWs!  at all....these speakers are a good choice instead of wiring down your  entire place.,3,0,759
A3MISZ464IOT6S,0,Been waiting to pick one of these up. but pay attention to the price on amazon.  Last night it was listed at the regular retail price of USD139.95. but this morning the price magically jumped to USD166.43??? Cant go wrong w this ereader  much better. lighter. faster than the kindle. just watch the price if purchasing on amazon.  Do not purchase if the price is more than USD140.,4,1,380
A3MJPAHCIEB3UG,3036,Great picture and great sound. However the two do not always seem to be in synch. Does anyone else have this problem. Its not extreme but if you watch the lips of the characters closely they never quite correlate with  the sound.  Existing CDs sound great on this player. and the second tray is  very useful for this.  Fast scanning could be better it just shows freeze  frames spaced out in equal time intervals. On the whole. for the money this  is an excellent product.,4,1,472
A3MJTC00XJWGBF,36,I read the many reviews here on this product before ordering and was somewhat concerned that so many seemed to have a problem with the software. I found the software to be easy to use although like my disc label burning software.fellowsneato.. I had to experiment a little to figure out how to align pictures of the DVD coversinserts correctly. I spent maybe 10 minutes and then began printing.I use standard paper to figure out the alignment issues as to not waste the actual coversinserts.. Some have said they would like a glossy paper option and I agree. This paper gives a somewhat dull picture quality but I still find it to be OK. If I has the option for glossy paper I would purchase that instead. I back up mostly movie DVDs and would like a more brilliant quality output. If I were backing up data DVDs. I would not have an issue with the paper quality. I have not used any other brands so I cannot. at this time. give a contrasting opinion of other products. I plan on trying other products though to see if any others do a better job for my movie DVD coverinsert needs. I will update later as I get more data on this subject. For now Ill say these covers are a good value for the money.,5,1,1198
A3MJXFGBKJNC65,23,Pros.  solid keyboard with no folding  harder to damage than the Palm rendition.The keyboard is slightly smaller than a normal keyboard so is a little hard to type comfortably for longer entries. but for most Palm entries. it works fine.Cons.  It is larger than practical for me for most uses since I got a palm to avoid carrying a laptopbulky stuff. So while it is nice that is one solid piece. I dont use it as much as I would if it fit in my fanny pack.,4,1,456
A3MKRAD7Z64ED5,11,One of these broke immediately and I dont really trust the other one. I have read a lot about the circuitry that goes into these aftermarket idevice chargers and dont feel safe using them now that I have read how some people have had their iphones melt or catch on fire.,1,0,270

A3MMSL5L771OZN,0,I am a relief fire lookout during the summer in remote southeast Oregon and I wanted a small radio. that didnt take up much room and was lightweight. I saw this and thought it might be fun to try the shortwave on the lookout at 7200+ feet elevation.  although I mostly wanted it for FM radio stations. This radio works very well.  It is exactly what I wanted.  Sound is good. plus it is fun and interesting to listen to the shortwave channels I can receive. I can receive many AMFMshortwave stations at the lookout.  I can also receive many stations at my home which is approximately 4250 feet in elevation.  Great buy!,4,1,619
A3MN5MVG61C71W,2,The card shipped fast. the memory card is a little slower at draw speeds then the built in memory of my Garmin Dakota 20. however I can fit the entire United States map on the card.  Its a great buy especially for the price,4,1,223
A3MNFT5VFJ2V0V,0,Very disappointed with this device.*. Touch screen is quirky. buggy and unpredictable.*. No way to get back to where you were if your finger happens to slip... very bad.*. Doesnt display side loaded DRM epub covers correctly.*. Freezes up fairly often. especially browser.*. When hooking up to a computer. files often get corrupted. device freezes after you restart. home screen gets messed up. etc. power down button misbehaves...Ive had to unregister and start from scratch 3 times already because of these issues.*. BN hardline pop oriented marketing sucks.*. BN bookstore misrepresents. mislabels books  show one cover. get a different book. You can end up paying for a Gutenberg press item that they displayed with a phoney commercial cover.*. Dictionary is limited in its vocabulary. and you cant access the dictionary by itself. nor does it link to other words or references.This is a compromised reader and a compromised tablet. Im sorry I bought it. Ive never used a Kindle .nor will I ever. but besides the Kindles. if you want a GOOD reader. get a Sony T1. If you want a tablet. buy a real tablet.,1,0,1108
A3MOUH4NG87WAC,711,Im a newbie scanner and was looking for a good. all round scanner. I knew most of the bigger systems out there are using the u0026quotTrunk Trackingu0026quot technology. so decieded to buy a scanner that could track those systems .duh.. After programming the freqs into the scanner banks .daunting at first but once you do the first couple its pretty easy and quick. I was surprised by how quiet certain airways were. After a little research I discovered that some of the larger agencies systems are actually DIGITAL. and this scanner can not listen into them. That was a little annoying. Uniden now have Digital scanners and Trunk Tracking III capability. so if your area is digital .check before you buy. then you might be better holding off for the newer generation scanner. Apart from that little snafu I am very happy with the product overall and have enjoyed several hours of listening to airport and other frequencies. Wish it could monitor FM and TV audio .I have a radioreciever. yet cant listen to local radio broadcasts on it. seems a bit weird.. There is a gap in coverage between 512  805 MHz for some reason. so I miss some airport tower chat. Not a huge deal. In summary. ignore some of the hype that it has Trunk Tracking II capabilities. if your area is digital. it makes no difference. Ill probably wait until the prices come down to a sensible level and get a digital u0026amp analog system. Happy Listening.,3,0,1427
A3MPBA6NVIEZ6A,2527,Got it for a good price and it works like its supposed to so Im happy. If you need a 50 cable this will do the job.,4,1,115
A3MPT5IC3W54NK,0,I recently decided to purchase a GPS for our family camper. I purchased and returned 2 GPS units. the Rand Mcnally Palm V GPS and the Laptop GPS. The Palm V gps worked functionally. but would not turn off. It also was very sensitive to tree cover and positioning in the car. At times I could not get a fix.  It would not work at all in the camper. Then I bought Laptop gps with the Streetfinder software. The positon and heading would drift all over the place. and the signal strength indicators would drift up and down no matter where the gps was placed. I have to say that the Street finder display was great on the laptop. My bet is that they do not have a good Quality assurance program due to the low pricing.You are probably thinking  What does this have to do with the  Garmin GPS12? I did a lot of research. and came up with the GPS12 as the perfect solution. It powers up. and locks right on the satellites once its set up in less than 45 seconds! It works anywhere in the car  on the dash . on the seat. on the center console.and in the back seat. It works anywhere in our camper. It will connect with a laptop for a great heads up display on the camper dash! The laptop provides better mapping capabilties than the more expensive GPSs due to the larger display. I have also connected it to my Palm V in both cases with Streetfinder software. Why connect to the palm? because it has plenty of memory for map storage. larger display then most GPS units. and you can mount the palm right on your dash for a good decent sized backlighted display. Marcosoft has a great palm navigation software package.Best of all. I can take it all by it self fishing. biking or hiking. The Garmin GPS12 works great.and has a good solid feel. The case is quality made. with a nice quality keypad.I marked it at less than a perfect 5 because I think they should include the data cable or at least the cigarette lighter adapter.,4,1,1917
A3MPYTVY1KX7CH,2929,Bad cleaner! Did not work. I put it the cassette player a dozen times followed the directions and player was the same. Wouldnt recommend.,1,0,137
A3MQ7G8NTCG2QY,0,I love my nook so much i can go to barnes and noble for free and read books and also check email and stuff like a regular tablet the only thing i cant do it is take photos which doesnt bother me at all,5,1,201
A3MSY86S6L36SM,24,When I first heard about ereaders. I was skeptical. since I love real books so much. However. I have been extremely surprised by how much I love using my nook! I got it as a graduation gift from college. and there are many things I love about it. Its easy to read and carry around with me. The first book I read on it was Gone with the Wind. which would have been pretty big to carry around! It is very easy to use. I love the color touch screen. and I love getting the free classics! It is wonderful to travel with .so that I dont have to bring my whole library with me!. and it has a looong battery life. I have been able to use it continuously without charging it for 7 or 8 days. It charges pretty quickly as well. Ive put my pictures and music on it. and I enjoy playing the games. The only downside is that the internet feature is fairly slow on it. although I regularly check my email and facebook on it anyway. It holds 1500 books. so I wont be running out of space any time soon .although I could get the additional memory if I needed to.. I have heard good things about the kindle as well. but I have to say that I am very very glad I have a nook. The nook has a replaceable battery so that once the battery runs out of juice eventually. I can just replace the battery rather than the entire product .unlike the kindle.. I also really love the color touch screen and the lend me feature .where you can lend your ebooks out to friends.. I am soo glad that I have a nook and I have really enjoyed using it over the course of the last few months! ..,5,1,1556
A3MTAVNH3DD835,22,Outstanding peice of equipment.  The reviews on the internet do not even come close to the performance level that I expected on the Sharp MDMS722.  The options that are given to you on this minidisc player go above and beyond the call of duty.  I never thought that I would be so impressed with something so simple.  The main advantage to me is how you can erase individual or all the tracks on the minidisc and start over fresh as many times as you want. not like burning a CD.  It is so light and easy to carry from class to class that anyone can enjoy.  I recommend this minidisc player and I give it a full five stars.,5,1,622
A3MTGZKXVTQC8D,33,Amazon dont sell the 4109X. but it has technical specs the same as the SD3109. just with a 6 disc carousel. which I find great as it allows me to load both CDs and DVDs. saving me the money .and space. needed for a  separate CD deck.I have played all kinds of DVDs and CDs through this  system and have found no problems whatsoever. so perhaps problems others  find are related to their system. I have my player hooked up to a Harman  Kardon AVR 45 and Toshiba TVMake sure you buy a Digital cable though so  you can get the best audio performance,5,1,546
A3MTGZKXVTQC8D,2224,I have had my 4109X for 8 months now. and absolutely love it.For reference. I have it hooked up to a Toshiba 32u0026quot TV. Harman Kardon AVR45 Receiver and Bu0026ampW speakers.The good .  Picture quality .  Incredible !  Playback problems . None. ever...and not only do I play my  own DVDs. but I tend to rent at least one or two a week..  Sound quality .  Again. awesome. Ok. so it does not have random play for CDs. but I can live  with that. as it saved me buying a separate CD player.   Recognition of  DVDs  CDs . Again. never a problem.Cons .   Noise .humming. on  playback . Commented on by other reviewers. This has happened occasionally.  but I have discovered it has nothing to do with the carousel. Oddly enough.  it depends on the disk you put in. I think the play mechanism must be  overly sensitive. as certain CDs and DVDs I play tend to result in that  humm. no matter which slot in the carousel and how clean they are. Mind  you. this happens less than 10% of the time.  The remote . I dont think  it is horrible. just a little over complex. Personally. I have programmed  the universal remote that came with my Harman Kardon receiver. and both my  6 year old and my wife can work that ok with either the TV. VCR or DVD  player !Bottom line....incredible that you can get so much technology  for such a low price !,5,1,1333
A3MTJ5KRR6PUMZ,1414,This was an easy product to work with and got my videos on to CDs in an uncomplicated way. Easy to use. I would recommend it.,4,1,125
A3MUHMPAX0N3XE,0,I bought this unit to put in a workout room for background music. After loading the cds and listening to some of them. I was very impressed with the features and sound of this system. Very good sound for the money. Nice way to store cds also. Works like a mini jukebox.,4,1,269
A3MV25SJZC5493,22,It helps you out a lot so that you dont have to reach into your pockets into pressing the big buttons on the Rio MP3 Player. This little handy dandy lightweight item placed in the palm of your hand is all you need.  Its so easy to use. go buy one!,4,1,247
A3MVMPFBN1RFFV,33,I bought this for my son to practice piano with. He doesnt like his current headphone. Its the kind that covers the ears completely. and his ears turn red and itchy from it. This one doesnt cover the ears completely. but the foam part is still much bigger than your average headphone. So I took off the piano connector part and snap it onto the plug a cheap headphone with small foam area. and my son likes that way the best. I try to give the headphone to a different son but he doesnt like the feel either. Prefers the cheap ones he already has.The piano connector part snaps onto the regular headphone part tightly. plus it has an area you can grab onto so that you can pull everything out of the keyboard easily so that the piano part isnt stuck in the keyboard when you remove the headphone.So now Im using in bed to watch movies on my computer while not disturbing my husband. It feels fine to me. but I have hair covering my ears. The sound is good. And it covers the sound pretty good. When I take off the headphone. I dont hear much from it.For the price. I think this is worth it.,4,1,1090
A3MVV4RDIWL1WM,0,This remote would not work on my old style Sanyo TV.  I tried for a long time to get it to read but it never did.  It did work on my newer Sony TV and my memorex VCR.  Definitly worth 10 bucks if it works on your set.,2,0,217
A3MWXBQSHPFQMX,89,I have the model below this. TRV110. Digital is where its at. No matter how many times over I record my 2month old son on the same tape. the picture quality does not diminish.  It is extremely amazing. I did a PCN performance up in SF and I had great closeups from the back row.  Builtin  mic is o.k.. I would recommend upgrading that. Also. upgrade the battery to  at least to an 8hour. Theres cool features too. Picture mode will  record 5sec stills.  Playback that on your VCR with music hooked up to the  audio in and youve got a musical slide show!  My wife has been  experimenting that with our wedding pix.  Nice stuff!  A lot of video  effects. Ive yet to learn.  This thing also has night vision!  In the  dark. it shoots our infared beams that act like a spotlight.  Very cool.  This cam as well as its upgrade very recommended! Neil,5,1,843
A3MX0XE7UPEZ62,44,I purchased the Diamond Rio. and it has great sound. One problem. The LCD is messed up. I dont feel like returning it. but I hate when something has a problem like that. I am still neutral because of the LCD problem. but one more problem with it and its going back. It could also use a better warranty,3,0,301
A3MX2DZ3O1ULBF,24,Why would anyone want a diskette drive?? Well. I have lots of applications on various computers.. under different OS.. For me. it is simpler to back up to a diskette and put it with the computer that is running the application..  I may move to cd roms. as they are less expensive. ... but for an example.. lets take my digital photographs.. I have +40.000 stored. I have them backed up in several locations.. but how to I find the one Im looking for? Ive file them by datemonthdaysubject for day.. so I can browse the dirtories...  But with programs.. running on my server. my Raspberry Pi. my Ardiumno. my router.s.... I am looking for a single storage.. for single application.. . .I have lots of experience.. used mysql. wikis. etc.. but for things I only want to find once in a while.. for a single applicaiton..... but for the review. the drive work super.. shipping was fast .. and just what I ordered...ciao,4,1,914
A3MXGAINSUFF8C,0,These extra high grade TDK video tapes are really terrific. Weve use them on two different video recorders and get great results on both.

To fix it I have to unplug the Ethernet cord and replug it back in. An easy fix. but boy is it annoying to have to do this every 20 minutes. 8 hours a day. 5 days a week.Plus. if you connect remotely to your work computer as I do. you rely on that alwayson connection to do that. What a nasty surprise when you attempt to connect to that machine and find that its offline due to the stupid Netgear hub!,2,0,564

A3MYSFH0TOO6AN,0,I received the same nonconforming item others describe  blue LED. different shape. not a Garmin product. Based on the reviews here. I did not even try it out. but contacted the seller through amazon.com and through direct email.

A3N3TVGNYYWCNN,0,I bought two Nook Color ereaders last year and they both broke down.  One unit was still under warranty so they replaced it with a rebuilt unit .meaning someone else had rejected it.. The second unit just missed warranty coverage and I had to throw it out.The Nook deserves zero stars because it is a piece of junk. It is my belief that Barnes u0026 Noble does not know how to build reliable electronic devices.LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE. DO NOT BUY ANY MODEL OF THE NOOK!!!,1,0,472
A3N4QU9537CZ5O,0,We have two of these and recently used them in both Ireland and Sweden. It includes plugs for UK. US. European. and Australian style plugs. Contrary to what one other reviewer says here. it does really support Australian plugs. To use it on an Australian outlet with the angled slots. just twist the blades of the US plug.The fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it. I have removed the fuse and ordered replacements. When I get it working again. Ill post an update. It is marked as a 3 A. 250 V fast blowing fuse. which means that this is rated for about 750 W. Thats about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer. so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question. but its more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry.The red indicator LEDs are helpful to know that its working. but they are fairly bright. so if bright LEDs in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping. plan ahead to cover them up with something.Update. I replaced the blown fuse with one of these.QUALITY USA brand fuses!! Set of 5 pieces. 3AG3A250V. F3AL250V. F3A 250V. F3 L250V. F3A 250V. F3L250V cartridge GLASS fuses 6X30mm .14 in x 114 in. . 3A 250V. Fastblow .Fast Acting.. Everything appears to be working fine. and I now have 4 spares to take with me on my next trip.,5,1,1342

A3N5630QP9J06Q,0,The NOOKColor is awesome it plays music. is expandable. displays gorgeous color. allows you to surf the internet .not optimally. but the ability is there.. and is mostly easy to navigate. From me. it gets a solid 4 stars. The problem is that as an eReader. its already overpriced. and the Amazon sellers who offer it are asking ridiculous amounts. Its cheaper .and ships free. from Barnes and Noble. Amazon is usually 1 at everything. including price. and I already own two Kindles .I would buy the Kindle in color if it came that way. but the price being charged for the NOOKColor on Amazon is absurd.,4,1,602

A3N7T0DY83Y4IG,11,Well. what can I say.  Ive had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T nontruck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route. otherwise. like most GPS s. it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Vias or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums. review sites. and wordofmouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size. and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was its very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell. but its really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual .available via the TND dock. is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as userfriendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen. as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no. that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price. and feature laden. I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS. the screen is magnificent. and the volume is awesome.Another thing Ive noticed. which I do not think is unique to this unit. is some of the weird routing that it does.  Ive never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally .and the others that use Navteq. has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you dont belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas. so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However Id be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POIs. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin. at least the ones that I have used. are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POIsTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point Ill have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros.Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons.inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Nontruck specific routings.Cost.,3,0,4590

A3N8ABT8BGBWZ8,25,Great radio in terms of portability. I use it at the beach. Red Sox games and Patriots games at the stadiums. It has a lot of great sound. Despite the 4 star review. there was one problem. After normal wear and tear use. the middle buttons ceased to work...Preset button 3. the weather button and the clock stopped working and it continued to flash 12.00 like a VCR. Because of the broken clock button. I couldnt reset the clock. When those buttons did work. it was great. However I still use the radio without those buttons and the radio flashes 12.00. I wish the clock would work. but oh well....The clock feature was great when you wanted to have a radio that gave you a clock and radio at the beach when you didnt want to take a watch with you. I wound up buying another copy of this radio when this one totally goes. There is also an issue with the blue plastic material where the buttons are. The blue flexible material will probably break eventually as the power button did. but the power button is still functional. Finally if youre considering a radio with TV sound. its a good perk. However when TV signals go all digital in 2009. I am not sure if youll still be able to get the TV sound. The TV sound works great if youre near where the TV stations broadcast. The weather band does me no good because I am in Boston and NOAA doesnt broadcast near the city. This is a great radio. If the buttons do break. it will be your only disappointment. I would never use it in the shower. I transmit Satellite Radio on FM transmitters and I use it to listen to XM and Sirius in my house and it does an awesome job. Considering the fact that it uses 3 C Batteries. its worth it for the sound quality. The presets are convenient and the sleep timer also is a good perk to save your batteries if you listen at night before sleeping. Overall a great radio. If the buttons break. its disappointing. but I got a decent amount of use from the radio before that happened. Shower radios are generally junk. This is a Sony and they always make good products. I wouldnt put the radio where water could splash on it.,4,1,2104
A3N8F42XR9MERI,0,The unit did not work properly.  The light would come on. but the disk would not spin.  It always gave an error message about the disk needed formatting. but it would never format the disk.  Had to return it.  Amazon does a terrific job with returns!,1,0,250
A3N97XQWK45881,22,This is a very good drive at an inexpensive price.  I have installed this  drive a few days ago and I have put it to the test reading. writing. and  erasing from over 75 disks with no problems.  This is basically just a  replacement for an existing drive in your computer.  There are no  instructions. ribbon cables or software shipped with the drive. Windows  will install a generic driver for the drive and if you are building a  computer. ribbon cables are easy to purchase.  This drive was very easy to  install and I did not have to configure IRQs or change any CMOS settings.  I recommend this drive to anyone with a failed floppy drive reguardless of  computer skills.,5,1,675
A3N9PTS418Y577,3340,I consider myself somewhat of a AV hobbyist haunting audio salons in NY and NJ since 1974 and this is one hell of a bargain. It has every feature I was looking for especially Component Video .Color Stream.which is a very  visible advantage over S Video. Good Job Toshiba !,5,1,272
A3NABLRMFV6OTN,3941,This arrived very quickly. which I appreciated. but thats the only good outcome of this order.  My compact disc player could not detect this disc and so I could not use it at all.  My CD player is a standard Sony home stereo horizontal trayloading type which has worked fine up until about two weeks ago .when it started skipping.  so I dont think it should have been incompatible with this product.  Im glad it was inexpensive. but I basically threw fifteen dollars away on a coaster with little brushes on it.. and I still have a CD player that skips.,1,0,553
A3NAXHLEP6GTGQ,0,Weve been using the FRS250 radio for about three years now with no major complaints.The radio offers the 14 FRS channels. and can optionally use the 38  u0026quotprivacy codesu0026quot to suppress communications from other radios .assuming that they arent using the same privacy code as you.. By setting the privacy code to 0. you hear everyones transmissions. regardless of their privacy codes.Battery life so far has not been an issue.  Though we havent measured how long you can listen or talk on a channel before the batteries die. we have yet to run into a situation where a fully charged set of batteries has run out on us during use.  A fresh set has lasted us a week at Disney World. for example. with moderate use .a few minutes of communication about a dozen or so times a day..  Still. rechargeable NiMH batteries would be a wise investment.Some of the more interesting features.1. This model does voiceinversion scrambling .referred to as u0026quotvoice privacyu0026quot.. which reduces the likelihood of eavesdroppers. only other users with a Cobra radio and the u0026quotprivacyu0026quot feature will be able to understand your conversation.2. There is a u0026quotsquelch suppressu0026quot button that will allow you to hear faint transmissions that would normally be silenced by the radio.  Note that youll hear tons of static too. so only use it when you need to.3. A lock button. to prevent accidental changes in your radios configuration.  This is more useful than it sounds. particularly in environments where the radio can get bumped around.Some caveats.1. Cobras marketing refers to the privacy codes as u0026quotsubchannelsu0026quot. which is a misnomer.  The radio only has 14 channels. and these 14 channels are set by the FCC for the Family Radio Service.  There is no such thing as a subchannel.  See the FRS FAQ for information on privacy codes and what they do.2. The voiceinversion scrambling offers privacy only from casual listeners.  People with Cobra radios or that have equipment to invert the voce signal will be able to hear you.  It is a very nice feature. but it does not offer enough privacy for things that you do not want others to hear .your credit card number. etc..Overall. weve been satisfied.  It would be nice if the headphone and microphone jacks were combined into a single jack. but this is a minor nit.  The unit is less expensive than the equivalent Motorola models. and performs well enough for general use.,4,1,2460

A3NC5KXUNCXRET,1,I got this card to upgrade my old P2400mhz. and I must say that I was extremely pleased with the performance. I never encountered any of the issues Ive read about. and the frame rates have always exceeded the demands of the games Ive played .including such eye candy as Diablo 2 and  Homeworld.. If you are like me and cant afford ... a top of the  line card. get this one. Itll do a fine job at running anything on the  market today and will probably do a fine job for the next 12 to 18 months.  A good return on your investment. if you stop and consider...,4,1,558
A3NCPBBAYR9CNP,33,The Memorex inserts are great. The label making software on the other hand sucks. Ive spent a few hours trying to get the text to line up with the paper without success. Perhaps its my printer. HP C4280. but considering the other reviews. I think not. Do not buy this for the insert labeling software. The inserts themselves are great. if you dont mind filling them in by hand.,3,0,377
A3NFGZ61KQ1XQ6,0,This radio. while larger than most portable radios. more than compensates for its size in the ability to pick up distant stations and superior sound quality.  I would recommend that prospective purchasers look beyond the package at the contents a reasonably priced and very highquality radio.,5,1,292
A3NGILRLE01DPV,44,I thought I would get more channels than my old rabbit ears with this RCA power antenna. but it isnt true. I live in a valley. and I only get two more channels than I did previously .and the reception is only average..My advice is to buy from a local retailer like Radio Shack. That way you can easily return the antenna if you dont get good results.Im going to try a rooftop antenna now.,2,0,388

A3NHXAXCZMTN50,11,I was eventually able to get the drivers to install and cooperate with the Samsung Alias 2. but when it was actually connected it would only let me see the music folders on the phone. I wanted to transfer photos. and have not figured out a way to make that happen yet. The incompatibility problem might be that this phone is four years old. The cord does charge the phone. and the phone plays the music files moved onto it.,4,1,423
A3NJ1W51XSRC29,0,I use these headphones when watching DVD and VHS movies at odd times so not to wake up neighbors.  The sound quality is quite good  sometimes surprising  considering the inexpensive nature of the product.The unit is easily set up  batteries need to be charged before initial use and after about every six hours of use thereafter.  The unit requires a bit of patience to be u0026quottuned inu0026quot and the signal varies as batteries wear down.  Oddly enough the volume control was placed next to the tuning control. which is annoying until you get used to it.I do not like to be restricted by headphones with wires. so I accept the shortcomings of wireless headphones.  Compared to other wireless headphones in the same price range the Advents have a richer. fuller sound and are arguably better constructed. If you are thinking about wireless the AW 770 are a decent choice.,4,1,877

A3NNSGACHBM7MK,0,The VideoSecu articulating TV mount is good but could be better. I unpacked the mount to put up a new flat panel TV in my bedroom and it took me about 20 minutes from unpacking to secure the mount to the wall .another 40 minutes to mount the TV.. Youll need some hand tools like a drill with drill bits to drill holes in your wall and a socket wrench to secure the bolts to the wall. Having a second person help you hold the mount while you screw it to the wall is very helpful since the mount is heavy and your arms get tired holding it over your head. You should also spray some WD40 to lubricate the joints prior to mounting it to the wall so the arm swings easily. You will also need a stud finder to attach the mount to wooden studs in the wall. Having the other person hold the TV while you screw in the four screws to the TV mounting plate is a must. It took my wife and I about 40 minutes to mount the TV to the wall from start to finish.,4,1,946
A3NNSVW2VRFVSX,0,I have purchased two of these Midland units and have been happy with the performance. Nice value for a low price.,4,0,113
A3NNSVW2VRFVSX,33,I had two of these units from Amazon with the same identical problem. The channel selector turned and clicked but did not change the channel. I also own the Midland 77092. which is actually a cheaper model. but Ive not had any problems with it. and am completely satisfied. You may want to consider that model from Amazon instead of the 77104XL.,1,0,345
A3NNSVW2VRFVSX,0,The Midland 77092 is definitely not overloaded with features. but it is a good low cost general purpose transceiver. I use it as a mobile unit with the Midland 182983 magnet mount antenna and am pleased with both products.,4,1,222
A3NNWJIWXVTXGF,0,Heres my take on Garmin ColoMap PROS Bright clear color display Very accurate trackingCONS Takes too long to accquire satellites .up to 1 min.Bulky .of course this is for the car so no big deal.Poor Battery Life The MetroGuide map data is not entirely accurate. I found certain location way off its correct position  Interface is not intutive. The device have a find feature but its very very very cumbersome to enter an address!. The strange thing is you cant even define an address through the software as well. Refresh rate is slow .1 sec.BOTTOM LINE  This will definitely keep you from getting lost. but could be more refined for the price you pay.,4,1,652
A3NOBWLCPQX6U7,1921,It did not live up to its claim. The reception wasnt as good as the radio I already had.  I returned it.,2,0,104
A3NP5DCFPFW9SF,38,This TV is extremely popular for all the right reasons.  I own several TVs and was looking to upgrade to a large screen.  I went around to many stores to compare the picture quality of several manufacturers.  This model was  equal or superior to all in the 35 inch or above category. except for HDTVs  and WEGAs which cost thousands.  I have digital cable and the picture on  this Toshiba is even better than the set I replaced.  My VCR was simple to  hook up and. even though it is not new enough to take advantage of the S  video or component video. the picture quality is superb.  I cant wait to  upgrade my VCR now and also purchase a DVD player to truly take advantage  of all this TV has to offer.,5,1,703

A3NS3XXZCQ5ATQ,0,Honestly. I was really just interested in getting an ebook reader. so you wont hear me whining .much. about how the Nooks functionality was crippled by Bu0026N.  What tipped the scales towards the Nook .instead of the Kindle. which was the other main contender for my money.. was its compatibility with the epub file format.  Its very tightly integrated with Barnes u0026 Nobles store. and as long as youre only interested in either books from that retailer or sideloading your own books via USB cable. youll be satisfied with this device.  Unless youre willing to root it. you WONT be able to sideload apps from a computer. and you also wont be able to access Googles Play store or Amazons app store.  Definitely a dealbreaker if youre looking to buy a fully functional Android tablet. but it works well for my own purposes.,3,0,825

A3NTCS0O8PUM1D,0,RE. all the comments on not being able to get the backing off this tape on the P70 at least. there is a little slot on the back of the printer that separates the label from the backing.  Its not obvious i had to download the manual to find it.  Using it takes a little practice you have to stick the label end in and then sort of strip it against the lip of the slot quickly to get the edge to come off.  Then you peel it off with fingers.Otherwise tape fine but unnecessary space before and after text when printing shameless way to make people use up more tape!,3,0,563
A3NU4O6977HQX4,23,I recently bought this item through an actual Barnes and Noble store and not through Amazon. but had to write a review on this anyway.  Long story short books sold on the nook seem a bit pricy and Id say about a buck or more than the books sold on Kindle or similar stores.  On top of that. after purchacing my unit and buying over 100 dollars worth of books. the thing locks up and took forever to come back.  Brand new right out of the box...first day.  The processor inside is not terribly fast either.  Im not sure what they are using but...Im not sure how reliable this device is.Ill be taking it overseas with me. Im not looking forward to finding out just how fast this thing gives out under those conditions.,3,0,716

A3NUM3JIE6II0F,0,These Memorex CDs are terrific.  Ive been using them with my Philips dualdisc digital audio recorder for four months now and have had absolutely no problems.  The sound is terrific. whether the source is my  home digital recorder or a professionallyproduced CD.  The sound is crisp  and indestinguishable from the original on my home stereo. computer. or car  stereo.As other reviewers have noted. another cool aspect of these discs  is that the Memorex name is so lightly printed on the face of the disc that  it doesnt show up at all. even through pure white labels.The price is  also great.  Ive only seen a comparable price in a store once. but its  much easier to be able to have them delivered to your home.Music lovers  and audiophiles. these are the discs for you.,5,1,772

A3NY5H9LQ5QEM3,45,A tool like this either works. or it doesnt. My GPS had been complaining that its maps werent up to date and I had lost the usb tool that connects my computer to my GPS. So I ordered this one. The end that is supposed to connect to my GPS fit into it. I connected it to my PC and it automatically performed the update. After I did this. my GPS hasnt complained that its maps arent up to date. so apparently it worked. That is all I can ask of it.,5,1,446

A3NYUAKC38HTKF,0,I had used one of those clunky tape voice recorders but never seemed to have it available when I needed it because it was too big to carry everywhere. Well. this one is a perfect size and weight. I attached mine to one of those little retractable ID badge thingies and usually clip it to my belt or shirt. And dont mind others asking what it is and then saying. u0026quotWhy would you want to record yourself?u0026quot We know how valuable these things are! There are two reasons. however. that I didnt give it 5 stars. 1. As others have commented in these reviews. the record button is much too easy to activate. If the button were a bit more protected I wouldnt have been recording a half hour of pocket noise 3 or 4 times a day .this practice burns out batteries very quickly.. Thats why I started wearing it like an ID badge. Yes. it has a HOLD feature. which locks out the buttons. but its awkward to have to switch it off every time you want to use it and then on again to lock it once more. 2. If you happen to begin speaking immediately as you push the record button. the first half second .more or less. of your voice gets truncated...kind of a bummer if you are recording somebodys phone number. email address. etc.As far as recording time is concerned. they might as well have done away with the 90 minute mode its obvious that you need those extra bits per voice unit. It sounds like a bad cell connection. I find that 30 minutes is ample time. and the sound quality is excellent.One more thingyou dont have to spend 2 or 3 hundred bucks on one of those voice recognition recorders to get it to work with your PC voice recognition software. I got a jack from Radio Shack that lets me plug in the headphone out on the recorder to the mike in on my laptop and it works decently. I say decently. Youll still have to do quite a bit of editing. If there is a lot of background noise. though. youll get mike errors.All in all I would buy it again. Its a great value.,4,1,1972
A3NZEQJJZEZROW,55,The cable did its job. It arrived on time and was as expected. I needed a CAT 5 cable to hook another PC to my network,4,1,118
A3NZNQ0BYN0RQV,0,its a good portable cb. I use it everyday in my car hooked up to an external antenna. its not a base cb or a car mounted cb but.it functions pretty good for me. I would recommend it to friends or family.,4,1,203

A3O0HWQUC20HU7,1,I bought the nook and it has never worked since day i received it. i dont know what the problem is. it does not turn on nor does the charging light flash when i plug it in to be charged. i dont even know what it is like to use one. im a bit sad because of that but i the seller who i bought it from is giving me a full refund so i am glad my money did not go down the drain.,2,0,374
A3O0XKFFCB9MIW,24,The Rio 500 is a nice compact light MP3 player. It has a nice screen and a quality backlight. The song name are easy to read. The only problem I have it that it loses its USB connection when transferring songs sometimes. One feature I really like is that the single AA battery lasts for 13 hours of continuous play. The software works very well and can be updated online for free.  I think that its a good package and worth buying. Even though it has a minor connection problem. I would recommend it 100%.

A3O4OL81Z48AVF,22,I bought this for my 7D. it good. material seems ok. bit cheap. but it works. But I think it is still a bit expensive compared to same cables from MonoPrice.The thing is that I discovered that having a converter from mini and regular HDMI and a cable works better for me.,4,1,271
A3O5K12S4996HM,0,Everyone so far is right.  This is a great product to store your dvds.  You do have to trim the covers to fit.  Beyond that is works perfectly.  I have 3 of them.  I would recomend this to anyone with a large dvd collection.,5,1,224
A3O5L8SPLFU6SU,22,I bought it on sale from the Barnes and Nobles website during a sale of their Jack Spade Accessories for theBarnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader .WiFi only. . Black u0026 White..  It was 80% off from the original USD85. so it came out around 25 after tax and shipping costs.  It seems to be difficult to find outside of their website however.Going into the actual product. its build quality is quite good.  Its well sewn. and uses canvas material for the external. red cover and a striped blue and white cotton fabric.  It has a slot to hold the Nook in place. and it is quite rigid.  It also has two bands at the top to hold it in place as well.  The black. rigid bottom has opening for whatever access you need from there. such as the charger.As for how well it protects. it will at as a buffer for the everyday dust. scratches. and fingerprints that will strike your Nook.  However. it isnt designed to protect the Nook from nasty drops and bumps. like an otter box has been.Overall. it is a beautifully designed case that will suit the needs of an average Nook user.  It may cost more than its rivals. so that may stop some purchases right there.,4,1,1148
A3O5RUMB8OWOSK,0,This is one of the best designed products in the world for the price.  But its like buying a horse and plow. and then pulling the plow yourself.  Youll get the field plowed. but itll be a lot of work.Look at the  Studio DV discussion thread on the Pinnacle Systems web site.  Its all  right there.  I spent 2 full weekends getting a 3 minute video done.  Studio DV doesnt readily accept capture from Studio DC10+ as I hoped.  Studio DV crashes constantly.  The bigger the video. the more the crashes.  I love that you can drag and drop video clips onto the audio track ...  except that it causes a crash.  I love that you can import CD music ...  except that it disappears in the final render.  I love that rendering the  final movie is so easy ... except that Studio DV spotaneously reedits your  movie while its rendering. randomly changing how youve trimmed clips.  deleting transitions. or changing the volume.  My personal favorite is  Studio DV deciding to replicate my entire movie and gluing it on the end of  the movie ... two for the price of one. I guess.  I love the preview  feature.  I would love it better if the final video actually looked like  the preview.So. I sincerely hope Pinnacle Systems fixes the problems  with Studio DV.  This could have been an awesome product.  For now.  however. its best for tiny projects and patient owners.  And. for the  record. my hardware is a 600Mhz PIII w 256MB RAM. 20GB C drive and 30GB  Firewire drive.,2,0,1460

A3O6YF3I1C7RC6,22,I bought this Discman from Amazon a couple weeks ago as a birthday gift for my mother.  I liked the price and it seemed to be of good quality.  Once the Discman arrived. I presented it to my mother during a trip to the  beach and I ended up listening to it for several hours throughout the  trip.First off. I really liked the headphones.  They were very  comfortable and gave off good sound.  Next. I found that the Discman had  many useful features.  The ESP was wonderfulit would not skip even when I  tried to make it skip.  I listened to it for about two hours of driving in  a car. with it sitting on the seat. and it did not skip once.  I even  knocked on the top of it a couple times. gave it a few good jolts. to see  if it would skip and it didnt even stutter.I also really liked the  resume feature.  If you turn the CD off in the middle of a song and leave  that same CD in. then when you turn it back on. it will start up exactly  where you left off.  Not mindblowing. but nifty and somewhat handy.All  in all. I found the Discman to be a great buy. .And my mom has come to love  it as well. as soon as I actually let her use it..  The ESP is top quality.  the sound is good. there are plenty of features. the headphones are  comfortable. and the price is definitely right.  Highly recommended.,5,1,1306

A3O7ZJP85FCLLJ,0,I bought this camera on the strength of the recommendation from the shop owner. Its very compact. weather proof and easy to use. However I am not altogether happy with it for the following reasons. .a. I dont beleive that APS is as good a film format as 35mm. .b. the buttons are not very ergonomic. .c. it can be difficult to keep the subject your are shooting in view when you depress the button due to the cameras small size. I would definately only buy this if you have small hands.,3,0,486
A3O89QD2JJ2S3U,34,This product claims to have perfectly synchronized audio. which it does. but only when playing back a recorded clip on your computer.  When viewing the input on your computer or outputting to a television. there is a delay  of about one second from the time you hear something to the time you see  it.  This device does not function as a normal TV tuner or TVout device.  nor will it work for videoconferencing.  Youre probably better off buying  an internal video capture device than going through USB.,2,0,503
A3O8L4OKEOBM6W,3335,I bought one of these a while back. It was a complete waste of money. The night vision only works within a few inches. battery life less than 5min. and when it used to work. it took 3 or 4 tries just to turn it on. It also overheats when it charges. Im guessing this is what led to its demise. Now when I turn it on. the red light stays solid and wont let you do anything. and wont even turn back off until the battery dies! This is an overpriced piece of junk! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,1,0,490
A3O98SAGKGPF1X,0,I received my Dazzle with my Inspiron 5000e computer from Dell. The computer was specified with an eye to video capture. 850mh. 32gb hard disk. CD writer. extra RAM. etc. I had problems from day one with capturing and editing. Despite just purchasing the package. I was promptly told by Dazzle support that I would have to purchase the upgrade disk  another .price.! It still did not work so now I was told to download a patch. this was free and still did not work. I got through all the usual problems one encounters by spending hours browsing the Dazzle board. emails and telephone. I am now giving up as the last problem is unresolvable or seems to be. Despite shutting down all secondry programs on the PC .the DVD drive. virus protection. and everything else that can be thought of.the videoaudio synchronization is garbage. After five minutes of capture I could be watching a movie with another movies sound track  it is so far out of time. I am now looking around for another system.,1,0,990
A3O9SDB8CGAR7E,22,From what I readheard. this was the player to have.  The first player received from Amazon didnt recognize DVD disks.  A slight issue.  The replacement player I received caused a oscillating u0026quotBrightnessu0026quot  on the TV that wouldnt stop.  I was like someone was dynamically changing  the setting every 5 seconds.When I contacted Sony to see if there was a  setting I could change. their response was u0026quotSounds Like Amazon has a  bad batch of these players...u0026quot  I guess a DVPS550D that works is  supposed to be specatular.  Good luck in getting one from here.Just FYI.  heading to Sears to buy a JVC and remove all potential issues from this  equation.,1,0,677
A3OA4V3JUB70NS,4,This is a terrible piece of graphic card. It was good back in 99 but it is not good now. Most games now require 16MB. This only has a shockingly bad 12MB! The only thing you can play with this is StarCraft. Go get a GeForce3 or Voodoo5. Dont waste your time on this 2 year old card.,2,0,282
A3OAHGHACQ6I8I,38,I bought SONYs similar top of the line model TRV 510 shortly after becoming a new dad. this after much debate between the 310 and 510. I decided that the 510s features and extras were worth the added expense.  Overall this camcorder does a very decent job of making digital home videos  and digital stills. but make sure you have plenty of light. otherwise the  results will be slightly grainy. Didnt notice the difference between the  regular video and S Video hookups to my TV. SONY should have also included  a titling function. the included battery is not sufficient for heavy taping  and use. need to get the optional battery. at least 4 hrs. use the original  for backup.  Still satisfed with my decision to get the TRV 510. but the  TRV 310 would probably be a good choice too and also at less cost.,4,1,806
A3OBVLPFPIJ0GJ,1201,While I do not personally own one of these myself. I have used it in a lab at my school.  When available. I almost always choose the machine with the Natural.tm. keyboard. as it truly does make it easier to type. and less stressful not only on hand and wrist but on the shoulders. too.However. as some have noted. the movement keys .arrows. home. end. pg updn. ins. del. are rather small compared to the average straight keyboard. and theyre all reorganised. too.  Apparently this has been fixed in more recent editions of the board. but on this one. the Insert. u0026ampc. block have been ordered into three rows of two. rather than two of three. and this can make finding the delete key by touch. for example. a little difficult.  Not only have the arrows been moved into a cruciform arrangement. but theyre also about half the size of the rest of the keys. which again makes them hard to find.However. the keyboard as a whole is a responsive. painreducing. joy to use.  Now if only their software were so good. . .,4,1,1017
A3OBYP8XRDROHE,22,My son likes it means its a good buy.What I like about it is the price on spec with expandable memory.Been looking for a tablet with a one two one means 1ghz dual core and 1gb of ram.Found it at Amazon.com and cheaper than buying at Barnes and Noble.Wanted to get the Kindle Fire but it only has 8gb of on tab memory.Thank you.,4,1,327
A3OC83QRQF91H5,1,Ive been using my Palm V for 6 months now and I love it.  I had never used a PDA before and was afraid to make the leap into technology. but I found the Palm V to be very easy to use and intuitive.  Learning Graffiti  was quite easy and I had it down the first day.  I use my Palm everyday for  notes. to do lists. addresses and phone numbers. and a calendar.  I do  email on my PC. Hot syncing was easy. start up was easy. and the battery  lasts at least a week before needing a quick recharge.  I am no where near  using up the 2 mb memeory. although there is lots more I could be doing  with this machine.  Get a case for it. but not one of the 3Com ones.  Nurses think it looks cool. and for once I can read my own writing.,5,1,727
A3ODENXA668OR,1719,I got the Nook Tablet for Christmas last year. Since then. I have memorized the use of my Nook insideout. and know all the Pros and Cons.Pros1. Very user friendly. Has an easy to use menu button that lets you hop from one place to another on your Nook. You are able to put allot of your personal content on the home screen. making it really easy to get to your favourite apps and books quickly.2. Great storage. The Nook Tablet has 16 GB built in. and the memory is expandable up to 32 GB via a MicroSD.HC. Card. Content stored on card runs pretty fast for a Tablet.3. Bestever ebook reader. Its nothing that can be fought againsed. Nooks are the best ereaders of all time. You can change the size of the text. background page color and picture settings easy. Has a builtin dictionary that can be used to look up words that you dont understand in that new Hunger games bestseller. or just to look up any random word when reading Pilgrims Progress. Overall. a great EReader.4. Large selection of apps. The Nook store always will have the newest Fruit Ninja app. the new temple Run and much more. ranging from gaming apps to apps that will help your business thrive. the Nook store has it all.Cons1. The processor. Sometimes the Nook will run into reboots that can take up to a minute. though they never actually seem to help the Nook itself. It cant handle that many downloads at once. which can make your downloading of the Angry Birds series.2. Hard to unlock. Unlike allot of other tablets. Barnes u0026 Noble really have this one guarded. It is very hard to hack it .Legally.to get all of the Google Play apps. Theres a card that can do that. but it costs USD50. So. not the best for the techyapp types.3. Poor speaker. The Nooks speaker isnt the best. Even at full volume it isnt that loud. The only way to really hear anything good is with headphones.So. it seems like theres some for getting it and some for not getting it. But it sure works for me. At least it has a better ereader than the Kindle Fire.,4,1,2010
A3ODVYRIERNB4O,22,By the time I receive my USD30 rebate from the manufacturer. I will have only paid USD50 for this machine. Thats pretty good for a machine with 32MB of flash memory built in. Fair warningthis product may or may not for the technologically weak at heart. it all depends on what happens when you open the box. Do you know where to plug it in? Will it work on your system? Can you figure out how to use the software? Once you insert the CDROM. you can approach the entire thing by using the extensive manual. or you can just gun it like I did. I am not a computer genius. but I figured it out in less than 10 minutes. NOit isnt compatible with NT. but I would expect that they will release some form of software update at their website that would correct this problem eventually. But if youve got Windows 95 or 98 .the majority of us.. you should be good to go. As far as plugging it inits quite simple. I have a Gateway Essential and the cable connects right into the port for the printer. The software was very simple to workit uses a drag and drop system and songs take about 30 seconds each to copy from your hard drive to the player. Once the songs are on there. theres nothing else left to do but shut off the program. unhook the machine. and enjoy your music. Erasing songs is a breeze also. What I love about this machine is its so small and durable. On days when the worlds got me down. I can throw this machine across the room and know that it will be okay. .. The battery life is good. too. People in earlier reviews have complained about the company .whose website is none too fancy. and tech support. yada. yada. yada. If you knew what you were buying and knew the system requirements. you wouldnt have to resort to using those fairly shoddy resources. But if thats something youre concerned about for one reason or another. this is not the player for you. Go with the Diamond Rioand expect to pay a lot more. I have no complaints about my player. Im listening to it right now. It fits in my shirt pocket and its like its not even there. But just so you know. this should not be considered a replacement for a portable CD player. I recommend owning both since you can take a lot more music with you if youve got a CD player. Sometimes mp3 players get boring if youre going to work and have to listen to the same 10 songs all day long. If you want more memory cards for mp3 players. you will end up paying the same price you paid for the machine itself or more!,4,1,2470
A3OEWD7C1RW3OS,33,This headset works great with my sons Motorola walkie talkies.  Couldnt find anything in the local stores that would work.  This is actually his second set and he loves using them with his friends.,5,0,197
A3OEWQXYMIXYVI,13,Purchased four of these locks for various computers around the house. both portable and desktop types. Took a little while to coordinate the latchholding pins position to get the lock to insert into the docking slot in the first computer. mostly because of the ease with which the inserted key rotates and how easy it is to inadvertently spin the latching mechanism offalignment so it will no longer insert properly. But once youve figured out that tidbit the lock becomes simple to operate correctly and the subsequent installations became a breeze to complete.The attached encased steel cable is thick and stout. more than what you might normally see in other installations such as certain retail store tiedown security setups. for instance. This should provide relatively good protection for any computer fastened down with one of these locks. Its not to say that the computer is now impervious to theft. but the wouldbe thief will now have to have a fairly heavyduty set of cutters in order to get through this cable. The lock mechanism itself seem pretty solid as well the sort of force needed to break through one of these would likely inflict more damage to the adjacent computer than to the lock itself.Solid product at a more than reasonable price.,4,1,1257
A3OFCK4WIL8TFI,0,i own a mini disc. and have borrowed a rio in the past. i was unimpressed by the rio.only 30 minutes of recording time limits your options. you must record from a PC. you must have the internet to download MP3s. or you  must be able to make your own MP3s. and you cannot swap the  u0026quotdiscsu0026quot or memmory chips out.however. minidisc players. while  more expensive. and weigh slightly more. have much more options. you can  record from any audio source. 8track. LP. tape. CD. laserdisc. DVD. TV.  DSS tuner. radio. microphone. etc. Discs are more than twice the length of  a rio. and at USD23 are affordable. and can be changed. they can record from  CDMD using an optical cable for perfect CD quality sound.spend the  extra money and get a recordable portable MD player. the extra features and  advantages far recoup the extra costs.,1,0,844
A3OFZ3G85I2H7H,11,I looked around for quite awhile before purchasing this camera.  I have had the camera for about 2 months and have taken hundreds of pictures.  I have been very pleased with the results.  Photography is a hobby of mine and. as a result. I am picky about picture quality and accurate color reproduction.  This camera is easy to use. fast to recycle between pictures. and the USB connection is fast and reliable.  I like the optical zoom .I have not tried the digital zoom..  The lens appears to be of good quality.  I have not detected any distortion.  Similar to other LCD screens. the screen on this camera can be difficult to see outdoors.  You can adjust the brightness. but this reduces your battery life.  I have experienced better than expected battery life.  With frequent use. I have replaced the batteries on a monthly basis.  Overall. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants good quality images that are manageable .compared to multimegapixel images.. easy to use feature set and a reasonable price.,4,1,1013
A3OHJS5Q9C4IYS,1011,I bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool.  I am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box.  If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit.  I am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area.,4,1,310
A3OHRN6G1V69KS,34,After plugging this in to the nuvi u0026 the wall. my nuvi cycled on u0026 turned off over and over and over and over...well. you get the picture. Although irritating. I let it do this for about half an hour. When I finally unplugged it. I found that not only didnt it charge. but it used the battery life the nuvi had. The only reason I didnt return it is because it was only a couple dollars. It would take too much time u0026 effort to bother. Update. upon reading this review. the company sent me a refund without my asking them to. So. I have changed my stars to 3 to reflect the surprising u0026 nice customer service. It may be that I just got a glitchy charger after all.,3,0,679
A3OHV5HUHG1QXH,11,I know how this lock is supposed to work and have gotten it to lock before. but it is so frustrating to use. I just spent 20 minutes wrestling with it. trying to get it to lock. with no success. Part of the lock is too loose to ensure that the lock securely locks the laptop. If you have a USB device plugged in. or if your laptop is angled such that its facing you. the lock placement is awkward as well.,1,0,405
A3OI841P5R6FCH,810,A couple years back. I was considering whether or not to get one of these when a friend of mine got one and started showin it off to everybody in sight. One day I became one of the fortunate few to experience his new portable entertainment gadget as he popped in a fave platter and we watched the show together. It had amazingly crisp u0026 clear stereo sound for its size. as well as really good picture quality for such a small screen. though the detail was somewhat limited by the screens small size. It even came with a little clicker. complete with most of the functions u0026 buttons youd expect on a DVD player remote. I discovered that it can play music CDs as well. with sound quality that surpassed most portable Walkmantype CD players Ive ever used or tried out.But there were a few drawbacks that put me off purchasing this. First and foremost is the price although its significantly less expensive now than it was when I first looked at it. the PalmTheater is still a bit too pricey for me to consider it a good entertainment investment. For whats being asked. Id at least like to see this machine be able to pick up the local broadcast TV andor radio stations. which would be a great thing to have when Im out in the boonies and I need my Monday Night Football fix during the season. Also. I noticed that this little guy got a bit warm after about an hour of continuous play. Although I probably shouldntve worried about this as much as I did. I do know that heat is one of the big killers of electronic devices. especially something as small and undoubtedly delicate as this. Finally. this particular model being at least two years old as of my writing this. its no longer as uptodate or topoftheline as subsequent Panasonic .or other brands of. personal DVD playerviewers. If I do buy one. Ill probably go for a more recent model.`Late,4,1,1851
A3OI841P5R6FCH,56,Ive been using this particular model for three years. I use it mainly to take pics of the various items I sell on eBay. and Ive found it to be fairly reliable. although the picture quality u0026 resolution isnt always consistent. Some of my photos will be reasonably crisp u0026 clear others will be a bit muddy. Of course. this could just be due to a lack of photography skills on my part. since my parents also own one of these. and their photos consistently come out nice and clear. They use theirs to take reference pics and event photos for the various organizations theyre involved in.The Mavica MVC73 is okay for taking outdoor u0026 social function pics so long as the place being photographed is reasonably welllit. and the proper picturetype settings are being used. Unfortunately. the flash function for darker occasions isnt all that hot. It throws a bit too much light on the subject.s.. and has a limited range of about eight feet .approx. 2.5 meters.. Beyond that. you might as well have taken the pic without the flash at all.The camera also features a playback mode. where you can review the previous pics in the disc. Its a good thing to have in case youre not sure if the last snap you took came out well or not. In my case. usually not! Another nice feature is the auto shutoff. which kicks in after about two minutes of disuse.Although the battery is stated to last for up to 2.5 hours. Ive never gotten more than an hour and 50 minutes from a ful charge. Never the less. a `full cell will usually last me a week or so. since I dont use it too much. One somewhat inconvenient thing about the battery. though. you have to remove it to recharge it. instead of just plugging it directly into an AC adaptercharger. And even though the storage on 3.5 inch disks is convenient in one sense .I can download the pics from the disk into the hard drive faster.. the limited capacity of the disk can be a problem. At most. I can get 18 images onto one floppy.Oh. and one last thing. I know this sounds a bit clichu0026eacute. but do remember to remove the lens cap before trying to photograph something! Ive had times when Id turn my camera on. and the view screen would be completely dark. when it shouldve been showing whatever the lens was aimed at! Speaking of the lens cap. its attached to the neckstrap by a small cord. Although it has a small clip on it to hook onto the neckstrap. it never stays on! This isnt so bad if youre clickin pics at the normal angle u0026 elevation. but when youre shooting snaps of things on the ground below you like I do. that dangling cover in the frame can be a real pain!`Late,4,1,2626
A3OJB1UD9RDHPS,44,I bought it for my wife and then bought it for my self. To be short Nook Color is a bargain tablet slash ereader for the money. You are not only getting a color ereader. but............ an android tablet with decent processor and RAM. It is a goldmine for those who know what to do with android device. You can pretty much do everything what other expensive brands do with a little patience and knowledge. Do not worry if you decide to root it. This device is pretty much bulletproof and to brick it will take a complete idiot.Yes. no cameras or GPS. but really.... for 250 greenbacks you get solid company behind it and also are not in a annual rat race for newer. hotter devices. It will be a smart choice.Cheap tablets try to do too much to compete and lose in quality of components. this unit doesnt pretend to be a full tablet.... but it can if needed.,5,1,857
A3OKX5C2F9U14D,22,The Mavica FD73 is a good camera if youre just getting started out.  But the low 0.3 megapixel resolution is a problem.  Even on the u0026quotfineu0026quot setting. its still not enough detail to really satisfy.  Love the removablemedia method of storing pictures  allows extended sessions by giving you an unlimited and easilyreplenishable supply of media .you can make a quick dash to a local WalMart in a pinch..All in all. great camera for casual photoshooting. or if youre shooting photos for a personal Web site or smallbusiness Web site.  But if youre really into photography. and need the resolution. get one of the CD Mavicas.,3,0,635

A3OLAZKM77XR6P,22,I bought these headphones at a Tower Records about 2 years ago.  They are nice in that you can fold them and put them in a big pocket or purse and carry them to the gym.  Today I couldnt hear anything out of the right side so Ill need to toss them.  I was shopping around on Amazon and noticed the other review with the similar problem so I thought Id add to it. seeing that it may be a common problem with this model.  I had only paid around USD10USD15 in the first place.,3,0,473
A3OLLN3VV2SF0L,23,I bought this refurb for under USD100 and so glad I did! I tried the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 .expensive and glitchy.. the Lenvovo Idea Tab .poor performance. before I settled on the Nook. After using tablets at both high and lowend price points I figured I had nothing to loseand was pleasantly surprised by the Nooks capabilities!On the Nook I can read BN or Kindle books. play Scrabble from the Android store. and watch Netflix. More advanced features such as GPS and camera are unnecessary for me. and I enjoy the simplicity of this device. It has a sturdy build and even though I did not want a white tablet .fear of dirt. it has not been an issue. I have had it for several months and dont feel anxious about using it without a cover.Its ease of use. clean interface. adequate battery life. and features make this a winner for me in the under USD100 category. Add to that BNs 1year warranty and I am more than satisfied with my purchase.My only qualm with the Nook HD is that it has a proprietary charging cable .not a micro usb like cell phones. so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling. In addition. it will not fit just any usb plug .something to do with wattage. I think.. So if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work. Same thing with using a usb port on a computer. IMO this is a major limitation for an otherwise great device. especially for someone that travels frequently.,4,1,1423

A3ONGLBOV461QX,11,Before I bought this camera. I never took pictures. the marginal cost of taking any given shot was too high. given the film purchase and developing.  With a digital camera. this cost drops to ZERO  I can take all the pictures I want!  In that respect. its absolutely worth the USD that  youll spend on the camera. a case. NiMH batteries. and a charger.  Contrary to many reviews. the camera DOES NOT eat batteries too quickly I  used it heavily for days before the meter showed any drain.  The desirable  missing feature is an optical zoom. but you cant expect one at this price.  .Those of you not living on a college students budget may want to post  the extra USD. though!.  Pictures are amazingly clear and colorful. and  download time is nothing to complain about.  A great deal  GO BUY THIS  CAMERA!,5,1,805

A3OQPGBIGWGXAV,0,My car CD player had stopped working and when I would insert a CD and then take it out. my radio would also not work until I turned off the car and turned it back on.  I took my car to the dealers service department and was advised to buy this product first before spending USD50 for a diagnostics on the radio.  As soon as I received this product. I inserted it into my CD player and it started working again.  All it needed was a cleaning.  It has been a couple days now and my CD player is still working.  This product works!,5,1,528
A3ORB4W3GI1YFG,1515,I purchased this particular disk cleaner based on the reviews I read. It cost a little more but I know Maxell to be a good brand. The directions are not clear enough for me  they assume you already understand how the thing works. Then. I couldnt get it to work. It was supposed to go in and then start talking. Of the 4 slots I tried it in it only worked inone AND it wouldnt come out without tweezers that scratched the disk. I have a Bose player withthe extra disk player which is a very good machine. I had some minor problems with one slot and I was assured the cleaner would take care of it. I never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything. I am afraid to put it in anything for fear I wont be able to get it out again. I dont know if this was a problem with my player but some disclaimer about not working with some players should be added more clearly and should list the brands it doesnt work with.,2,0,917

You cant see the underside of the disc until you open the package. but the Maxell disc has a little brush embedded on the underside. whereas the other brand I had purchased did not.  Perhaps. this is why the Maxell cleaner did a better job?,5,1,450
A3OTY3KB4OG9FO,23,Must be made in third world country to inferior specs.  This holds position kind of like a wet diaper.  I am sorely disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for.,1,0,166
A3OW5F00Q1YQBZ,0,I bought a ten pack of Mwaxell eight hour standard grade along with a six pak of sony premium grade six hours and used the Maxells first and just after one month they where all thrown in the trash. What about my sonies? still working after four months,1,0,251
A3OX2ZKEHYM1Y6,45,As a voracious reader this is a great product for my life style. It display is very good and I find the opening to the page I left. I really like the library as I always have other books available to read when I finish one.Bu0026N site is also is a favorite as it allows me to prepurchase new books at a discount.If you really read a lot then this is your product.,4,1,364
A3OX7VID22JRKL,11,This wireless speaker had a usable range of about 5 to 10 feet. Not 300 feet like the description says. I even called tech support and they were no help.,1,0,153
A3OXDFPIX0XJ3K,22,I really looked hard at the various light .sub3 lb. tripod options to use with my Canon Powershot S2 IS.  Lighter the better. but I also really wanted a 3way pan head and all of the little nice extras that I could get. bubble level. quick setupteardown. fits inside of carryon luggage. good build quality. comes with a bag. good hand crank. etc.It definitely fit the bill perfectly. and was ONLY 2 lbs!  Of course you dont get super strong windproof stability at that weight. but I was really quite happy with the overall stability on my recent vacation.  When there was a strong wind. I leaned a bag. backpack. or beach towel around one of the legs and that gave me more piece of mind... but I think it probably would have been fine... especially when not fully extended to max height.Before buying it. the max height was actually my only real concern  would it be tall enough to take good people picturesoutdoor portraits while I was on my vacation?  My experience says  Yes. great people shots .and so much better than the typical shot you get by asking a passing by stranger to take a photo for you.!Dont hesitate. just buy this one!,5,1,1137
A3OY0MWW96E0KD,5556,Not a good buy Very poor speaker. even for a small one. Adjacent channel and bleed over occurs frequently on FM and AM even from stations that are many miles away. Controls are somewhat confusing.Not one of Chinas better  exports.,1,0,230
A3OYE7X2O08LNT,2024,Bought the mount for my 30  Dell U3011 monitor.  It fits the Dell quite well. and I bought it for its reach from the wall. its ability to manipulate. and its weight capacity.  And in all those respects. Im quite happy.However. there is a noticeable tiltsag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  Im not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall. as that was expected. but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.,4,1,425
A3OYR8X2O41XBH,0,Good Audio quality. many options for reasonable price. However the transport mechanism is too noisy and cassette comparment coverseject nobs substandard .poor.. Overall a good Deck.Challa S.Dubai,4,0,195
A3OYW8BNDAWFO5,2426,I got this because I thought my Sony cassetteto3.5mm adapter was brokenturns out it was my mp3 player that I had attached to it that was malfunctioning.So once I replaced that. I figured Id go ahead and keep using this Maxell adapter. Bad idea. Even with my ipod at max volume. I had to have my car stereo volume at about half .twice as high as it is for the radio or my old sony one.. and when everything is turned up that high. the quality is just bad.Also. I like to leave my ipod plugged in in the car now and then. especially on long road trips. But this? The audio cable is very poorly shielded and charging it and listening to it at the same time is a nogounless you happen to enjoy that incessant buzzing sound.So Ive been using my old Sony one and it all works just fineand I suggest you save yourself the time and hassle and do the same.,2,0,847
A3OZ1DMMP0OCWR,34,I used it when I had this phone and it did everything i expected. Good vendor I would buy again.,4,0,96
A3OZA8HNJM26DC,0,Got this the other day. the micro usb cable does not work consistently. I have not tried the other ones for fear of frying my palm pre.  At least one other person notes that the chargercable also does not work.  Hence. I would not buy here until this is cleared up.About a month ago they promised to send me a return label so I could return this for a refund. and still have not received my return shipping label.  Its been a month. I dont think the regular mail is THAT slow!  Will have to knock them on their seller rating.  Only buy from monoprice for cables I guess..,1,0,571
A3OZCXPCFML5ZF,0,IT DIDNT WORK!!The tape did not move at all when the Play button was pressed. I tried many times to no avail. Maybe it was just my luck that the tape I received was a defected one!,1,0,180
A3OZQGMISIJK61,0,A very good product.,5,0,20
A3OZZ0IQTIPZNW,0,Otherwise very good  Never tested limits of the battery  have used on AC generally  works very well. pricey  I would wait for one more generation if too expensive,4,1,162
A3P0TD093CXWR5,0,I ordered this for my two way radio. Only to find that it doesnt work for mine. So I really cant give a review on the item other than quality which is ok for what I paid. That said costumer service was excellent.,3,0,212
A3P10YMISKFYE,1,Do not buy this Sony DVD product. or any other.  The DVPS560D problem is STILL unresolved. and this player seems to share most of that players problems.The hardware is defective  but worse. is the aftersale customer service and concern from Sony.  They refuse to recognize the problems with these players  now numbering in the tens of thousands.Please do some research and find the petitions and classaction lawsuits online  before you buy this. or any other. Sony product.  Sony is a name that will no longer haunt my electronics cabinets.UPDATE. June 9. 2004. My Sony Home Theater amplifier died after 2 years of service over the weekend.  The front channel became unreliable. and. finally. went out completely.I replaced the Sony DVD player with a Mitsubishi. and its a fantastic performer.  I replaced the Sony amp with a Yamaha theater amp.  Paired together. they outperform the Sony pairing on EVERY level.I have convinced at least 50 people to NEVER buy a Sony product because of these experiences.,1,0,1005
A3P1AEV6KGPSYM,22,I gave this product four stars because 1. its weight. which was substantial. not plastic or flimsy 2. Ease of installation 3. Sturdy. there was no sagging or loose parts once TV was attached 4. The price was outstanding for the product received.I would have given this 5 stars. but have only had it for a few days. Time will tell if it is as good as first impressions.Even so. I am ordering two more for the other TVs in our house. Very satisfied.,4,1,447
A3P1K3A8LZLFJ3,0,I bought this as a replacement for the original that came with my Uniden phone .dog ate it.. This one works just as well as the original. I have been using it for a month now. working from home and spending half the day on conference calls. No issues with comfort or durability. The construction looks a little flimsy. but nothing has gone wrong with it yet. I just keep it away from my dog now! Its definitely not a highend headset but its a great headset for the price and it does the job.,4,1,491
A3P2HVF364DU9J,11,I needed a new charger. did what needed for a good price. I recommend this item to anyone looking for a new charger.,4,1,116
A3P3ZGJ5NI26PZ,0,for a little bit more money you could buy a laptop computer with a dvd player in it with a bigger screen and all the same stuff. this is a cool little dvd player though if you just want the dvd.......,3,0,200
A3P41WI06OW3U5,1015,I bought this CB for my Jeep in hopes of having a multipurpose unit that would allow me to communicate well with other Jeeps when I was spotting them on the trails. It performed well. but the ergonomics were very poor. It has no hook that would allow for a convenient and accessible place to store the unit while driving. Also. the channel change buttons are very close to the PTT .PushToTalk. button. so I ended up changing the channel every time I tried to talk.I imagine that time spent with this unit would have enabled me to get comfortable with its ergonomics. but I decided instead to return the product.,2,0,611
A3P4S8P6YN4LKV,14,Amazon had the nook WiFi here very quickly. I could get started on my own without too much trouble. I did go to Barnes and Noble a few days later and got plenty of help from the Nook man there on the finer points. I have been using it since Fathers Day and I really enjoy it. I also enjoy going back to the Barnes and Noble store and reading some of the books there on my nook free of charge.,4,1,392
A3P5CJS5GQ4UHL,0,Tapping into the right connections is must these days. I knew from the start I must find a quick and easy way to bring two points together. This product allowed me to make the connections I needed. It was simple and straight forward. it was uncompromising yet effective. It allowed me to get right into the places I needed. then bring both parties together. whilst allowing them to keep their distance. Some people want to be distant. but with this I was able to connect on a different level. Both sides came together within 3 feet. an amazing achievment seeing they were so different. Now they both work well together. They are happy and I am happy to be able to bring them together. Immediately they just connected. Thank you amazon.,5,1,735
A3P5CV06QLXGRF,15,I just got this mount to mount my 23 Coby TV. The mount plate covers all of the video and HDMI outlets on the back of the tv. The area for the power is blocked as well. I am going to have to take it to a machine shop and have them cut the plate below the mount holes. The chassis in these tvs should be pretty much the same. so you would think this company would take this in consideration. I am sure I am not the only one to come across this. There should of been a warning when I bought this mount!!!!!,1,0,504
A3P5F6LNN15PMK,24,I confess to being a little wary .of damage... knocking the lens etc. before trying this product.It is a speciallydesigned CD which has eight tiny tufts of what look like soft nylon bristles which the lens encounters and is gently and rapidly swiped by as you play the track on the CD to which they are attached.Immediately after performing the pretty quick cleaning operation I definitely noticed more bloom to the sound from both speakers .Classe ampCD with Logan electrostatics..So. yes. the product was safe for me. does what it says. is wellpriced and effective I would recommend it.,5,1,588
A3P5HG9R4ZTXJR,1617,I read many of the poor reviews and was wary. but for the discounted price. figured what the heck.The first one I received I followed the instructions closely and when turning on the speaker. heard a little static. adjusted the tuner knob. heard the transmitted music....for .5 secs or so. then nothing.....ever again.  I never even heard the static.  I tried various things to get it working but to no avail.  I returned it.very easy to return with amazon by the way. and received another quickly.  It did exactly the same thing.  Two poor products is two too many. so I asked for a refund.  Im now looking at other wireless outdoor speakers.You get what you pay for I guess.,1,0,676
A3P5TQZULTKUGZ,33,I bought mine in 1995 in Europe.  It worked fine until last year when the screen stopped working.  Even though the warranty period had expired Psion USA repaired it free of charge. within about 2 weeks of my shipping the product to them.  I have also found the technical service in the US .via email. to be outstanding.I have now upgraded to the Series 5mx. which has twice the memory and a faster processor.  I only did this as the old one was stolen.  I would not recommend upgrading unless you need the extra memeory.  The only other advantage of the 5mx is that the paint on the casing is much more durable.  ...I would certainly recommend the 5mx to anyone buying now.The diary and address book work fine.  I had about 1700 addresses in a 614k file.  The spreadsheet is compatible with Excel. but with less functions.  Sketch program is similar in performance to MS Paint.  It is possible to record voices or sound. I have never found a compelling use for this feature which uses memeory quickly  60 seconds takes about 500k.The monochrome .grayscale. screen is OK.  2 std. AA batteries less about 2024 hours. less if the backlit screen is used.The main differnce I notice betwwen the EPOC operating system and MS systems is that the EPOC system never crashes  not once in 5 years. and the computer boots up instantly.,4,1,1323
A3P60W3TJMXNQ5,1516,This item showed up and was dead on arrival. It does not work in my phone nor in any of the several PCs and readers I tried it in. What a piece of garbage and waste of my time and money! I picked this one instead of a standard MicroSD because it  claimed  to be for my phone. Now I have to go out to the store to find a card before my trip tomorrow!,1,0,349
A3P668ITIZXYNG,12,I bought this CD changer to replace an older version that. after years of excellent service. finally refused to recognise the presence of a CD. So far. it is as reliable in service and quality as its predecesor.  I recommend it.,4,1,228
A3P6WL9S5ORW6U,12,I had this thing for about 3 weeks before the microphone fell off of the keyring attachment. and would only loosely fit back in there. I kept this with my keys. and it was very durable. and held together very well up until that point.I ended up losing it one day. and found the unit about three months later in the driveway. a little scuffed up. but it worked fine. so I took a push pin and heated it up. and put a hole through it and put a paper clip through it and wrapped it into a ring. and clipped it onto my keyring with a standard clip. pretty determined to keep this thing. because I really liked it.Worked good for a few weeks. but the plastic was too soft to hold. and it ended up breaking through. In the end. Im just going to use the unit at home. but while it was still portable. it was really nice. Im giving it a 45 because for what its supposed to do. it works great.,4,1,883
A3P8CFZ8H5JWIU,11,These are getting hard to find.  Of course. the paper is NOT as heavy as it used to be. You have to down load the program to print on these. and if you do not have internet .some people still do not have internet at their house. then you have to get creative with other programs to make these work. Overall they are a good product.,4,1,331
A3P8IW1SD7KOPU,0,I finally purchased a Palm. and havent looked back.  Never late for an appointment and I always have peoples address and phone number on hand. Well worth the USD230.Would have been 5 stars. but I was disappointed with  lack of Netscape Communicator support.  Technical Service was of little  help. replying with u0026quotcannedu0026quot instructions on how to set up mail  .using MS Outlook Express..  I changed over to MS for my mail .so much for  the federal lawsuit. and I could then sych my mail .after upgrading to  version 5 MSOE..,3,0,537
A3P90POZ3HILTD,78,After reading many of the reviews on this product. I chose to get it. After receiving it. I knew that it was going to do a great job. Overall. the sound output does a great job and even when the volume is turned down you are still able to hear it clearly. The cord isnt that long. which can be a con for some of the bigger people out there. but for me. it fit perfectly. Overall I am very pleased with this product. You should get this if you are on the fence about it. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!,5,1,489
A3PB65ID19UGRZ,0,This thing does what it is supposed to an nothing more.  I dont feel extremely safe leaving it unwatched even with this on. but it certainly makes my laptop less appealing to steal.  If someone really wants youre notebook. this thing will only slow them down.  So dont swear by it.  I feel this item is slightly overpriced. but so are all laptop locks.  No real problems with this item. just nothing great either.,3,0,413
A3PBJDAFMITY1J,811,It is small. easy to carry and I havent used it yet because I am not sure its as safe as the car charger.,4,1,105
A3PBR05QIOQPD6,0,Lots of room and separate compartments for extra batteries and memory card. Makes a handy handbag too. Shame it is not leather but it is a pretty good imitation.,4,0,161
A3PC71XR7FX40J,33,These are the only brand I have used that played in all my players.  If you have a Dodge. Chrysler. Plymouth vehicle your CDs will play in your car if you burn them onto the Music only CDs.  I did a test between the Memorex and Memorex Music and the Memorex regular ones skipped all over in the car and the Music ones played as if they were the original.  At first I thought it was a creative way to charge more but they must be better in some way.,5,1,448
A3PCAWJDXOHR6Y,34,Yeah the charger came in sooner than expected its just it keeps falling out of the socket. One tiny tap on the charger and itll come right out. It got on my nerves so I ended up using a standard black berry usb cable. More reach. ACTUALLY stays in the phone. I ended up giving away the charger.,2,0,294
A3PCEB9ND82AGE,0,apple pretty much killed this standard by not letting it be more open and used. Such A great standard and was less CPU usage that USB.,5,0,134
A3PCJRCZLR7252,0,It is elegant. executive. and sophisticated. I will recommend to everyone who is involved in lot of business travelling. It is neither too small. nor too big. It is what exactly I was looking for. Now. I dont have to think about packing unpacking and can travel within short period of time. it has a perfect space for ur clothes. laptop. all office accessories and still doesnt look huge.,5,1,388
A3PCYN3UIBZ2FZ,33,My original charger broke.  By the time it finally stopped working. I was having to elevate the cord and arrange the cord in very specific ways to maintain a steady charge.  Too often. Id plug it in and the light would be green. as in full charge when the unit was actually near empty on the battery.  With constant readjusting of the cord. itd finally show yellowamber for charging.I tried to buy a generic charger that fit the Nook Color out in town but it had problems charging the unit.  For now. this product is working fine.  If problems persist. its probably the Nook Color itself that is defective in charging.,4,1,618
A3PDDZ42P4EL31,1616,I received this CD player about 4 years ago and it still is running good as new!  I love the 2 bass levels.Mega Bass. and Groove. they really boom the comfortable headphones.  It hasnt skipped at all.  Even when it fell of the couch without the ESP2 on!.probably just luck.The only thing I am dissappointed with is the fact that it doesnt come with the optional remote that controlls the entire CD player..  Not a big loss at all though.  I recomend this to anyone looking for a Discman.,5,1,487
A3PDGWYC08DXF4,33,My nook tablet has really made reading fun again! I was sick and tired of fiddling with reading lights while trying to read in the dark and. after seeing my friends kindle fire. decided to pick up a tablet for myself. The barnes and noble app market is a bit weak. but I bought my nook to read. so aside from a few games and basic applications its been a strictly literary experience for me. The backlight is great for reading in the dark. and i havent had any issues with glares while reading in the sun. The stock web browser is fine for basic browsing. but if youre looking for a true tablet experience you might want to wait for the Google Nexus 7 tablet. The nook tablet however. as it stands. is an excellent ereadertablet for USD200!,4,1,740
A3PEHAB1THK701,0,I actually have some background on this type of product because I have worked in the CD industry for almost 8 years.I personally reviewed this product compared to 67 other products that are similar when we were  looking for the best repair solution available.Basically. what I found  is that the Allsop repair solution was one of the top two products that I  tested.  The only other comparable product had a two part solution.  sandpaper. and polishing cloth...it also costs almost 3 times the  price.The main thing that I have found with CD scratches is that it is a  VERY fine line between what scratch can be repairable. and what cant.  It  is also makes a HUGE difference what direction the scratch is in.  If it  goes along the radius of the CD. it is far less likely to be repairable  than one that goes across the CD.  Also. the depth and magnitude of a  scratch is very unpredictable as to its repairability or not.If a  scratch on a CD IS repairable. Ive found this product to be one of the  best Ive used yet.David DeYoung,4,1,1032
A3PER83TKVJ66Z,5358,I replaced a squeeky cassette adapter in my car.  This unit is quiet as a mouse. the sound quality is good. and the adapter inexpensive.,4,0,136

A3PH2H3IL62IL5,0,Despite the bad reviews I still bought this item. from a differrnt seller however. and knew ahead of time what to expect. My experience with this seller Accessory Genie was a good one they shipped it out to me alot faster than expected and sent a follow up email to make sure eerything was alright,5,1,297
A3PHCUOB06YBVS,22,Im giving 3 stars because it did give several years of good service.  Its now dead and will not power up.  Im not going to repair it again. its just too much trouble to do so and its no longer in warranty.  The first failure was caused by the feed mechanism jamming this was about two years ago.,3,0,295
A3PIBIKD18RKAZ,11,I bought the Rio 500 a few days ago after reading the comments on this forum.  I echo the statements about the documentation being woefully sparse. but since I already had RealJukebox installed I was able to use  that with ease.With an existing stash of mp3 files and having  RealJukebox already installed I was ready to listen within about 20  minutes.This is a great player if thats what youre after.  To the  reviewers that complain its too expensive  WAH!  Relatively new  electronics always are.  If you cant afford it either buy something more  lowend or wait awhile until the prices come down or the item just becomes  obsolete.My 2 minor complaints are the requirement of Win98  no NT  option. and the foam covers on the headphone earbuds come off easily. but  buy it anyway!,4,1,783
A3PIPAS3M7YLQC,68,I own the original Nook eink reader and the Nook tablet.  I have been happy with both.  When I read all the wonderful reviews about the Nook HD+ I couldnt wait to buy one.  The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type.  The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet. not only for reading. but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that. but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However. there are several problems with the current edition.There needed to be at least one more font size at the highend.  I had to choose between too small and too large.The sound level was too low. even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of thirdparty applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.So. in spite of the beautiful display. I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.  When planning future upgrades.  I would advise Barnes u0026 Noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities.  We are not an insignificant market segment.,3,0,1316
A3PJEEVDMKBBKS,33,I purchased my S550D without reviewing other brands and products. believing that I could not go wrong with Sony. I had to have my player repaired due to a sync problem between the sound and video. It gets worse  as you watch until you cannot stand it anymore. Sony fixed it. but I am  afraid it will come back.,2,0,310
A3PJMLGXMGC0ZV,0,I was looking for a good radio that was inexpensive for work.  This radio is perfect! Its is small and built well .its been dropped and banged around quite a bit and is still going strong..  Its gets all of my favorite stations with no problem and I leave it on for 8 or 9 hours a day. 5 days a week.  This radio is great and I would definitely recommend it if your looking for a nice radio for some background music while you work.  If is does happen to break some day Ill definitely buy it again.,5,1,498
A3PL38VHVSKGOO,22,What can I say...  This is quite simplly the best organizer you can have.  Forget carrying around a laptop.  I can hold my class notes and keep them seperate from info on my customers at work.  I have a freeware photo album  that keeps pictures of my wife and child.  I now can have a real carry  around check book.  The 2mb may sound small but really it does do quite  well.  I have lots of programs on mine and I have 40% free.  Tip.. get at  least the slim leather case... trust me the supplied flap is less than  desirable.  You will keep this with your keys.  It goes everywhere with me  and I never need to call 411 again.  It is also nice to have a calculator  at my fingure tips as well.. Currcalc is good since it has conversions.  So  to finalize... forget laptops. notes. phone book. planner. pics of my  family. spreadsheets .freeware.. calculator. and all in my pocket.  Why  anything else...  and yes frogger is the only way to kill a half hour !,4,1,960
A3PLX6PTM2ERKL,0,What Can I say? Palm products have always been of the best quality. and the Palm V Hotsync Cradle is no exception. I purchased an extra cradle for use with another desktop. so I can sync with several computers. The cradle bottom is metal. and there is enough weight that it does not move if the cord has a bit of pull on it. A must buy for palm V.x. users that need to sync with another computer. or need one at the office and at home. Whatever the case maybe. its very handy to have an extra cradle around.,5,1,507
A3PLX6PTM2ERKL,99,Ive had the Fisher SLIM1500 for almost a year now. the first thing that was wrong was that some cds would skip. seemed to be caused by the vibration it makes when spinning. I remedied this by shaving some of the plastic off from the top spinner .I wouldnt recommend doing it for yourself. could render your CD player useless.. I thought the stereo would look professional in my office. but without the base and hung from the wall. it looks ugly. The sound quality is quite poor as well. and it is hard to position the antenna to recieve stations that I was previously able to listen to with a different stereo and the same type of antenna .wire.. I see that this item wasnt available at the time this review was written. maybe Fisher got the idea and stopped production. hopefully improving it. I like the looks. but it doesnt perform as well as I would hope for the money. Id stay away from this one.,1,0,901
A3PLX6PTM2ERKL,34,Ive always seen highquality products from Belkin. and this one is no exception. It is a highquality USB cable at a great price. by a leading computer accessory company. An extra bonus is the lifetime warranty!,5,1,209
A3PLX6PTM2ERKL,22,Ill admit it. I bought the case .the metallic blue one too!. just because it was sexy. It does a good job protecting my Palm Vx. but the case doesnt seem sturdy. There also seems to be a problem where the contrast button at the top of the Palm Pilot gets pressed by the case. this can be fixed by sliding the Palm just a hair. Overall. this case rocks. very glad I got it. the metallic blue one is better though. I get many compliments and good looks from it. Buy It!,4,1,467

A3POK7TFSW520G,11,I own a 300SE and aside from the fact that it has updated firmware and more memory it is exactly the same.  I was worried about things that I had read stating that the case was shoddy. the volume level was insufficient  and the memory didnt hold enough.  I just wanted to say that all of this  IS NOT true.  It seems really solid to me. not that Id ever drop the thing  or be rough with it. but it does just fine while jogging or riding a  bike...as for the volume level comments perhaps people are just listening  to songs encoded at a low base level because I listen to mine on level 5 of  20 and its fine for most songs unless Im in a REALLY noisy  environment...lastly I listen to all of my songs at 128k. and I can fit an  acceptable amount of music on my 64megsno it isnt as much as a CD but  with 2 32meg smartmedia cards on the way that should be more than enough to  get me through all but the longest of plane flights.  With the portability  of the transfer cable and software I can just burn all of my mp3s to a Cd  or 2. throw it in my luggage and change the songs out from wherever I  happen to be...much more efficient than lugging around all of my CDR mixes  and other CDs.  True the parallel transfer is much slower than the USB that  the 500 offers. but do I really want to use USB when places that I travel  might not offer USB support?  Also the backlight of the new 500s are  supposed to drain the battery power and I dont find the lack of a  backlight to be as big of a problem as I thought it would be. however.  I  would definately recommend purchasing the rio remote as it super easy to  use and extends the headphones cord length by a good 2 feet.  See ya!,4,1,1681
A3POXPB7ITWR3E,44,I got the PMP300 as a birthday present. and I love it.  I am a college student. and i already have a huge MP3 library on my desktop.  I also discovered that more than half my MP3s are encoded at 64 kbps. so I can fit a little over an hour of my favorites on it and take it with me to .boring.  lectures. the library. or to work out.  This BS about only fitting 30  minutes of music is because the encoding is at CDquality...Ive never  noticed a difference.  With the rebates. it is almost as inexpensive as a  Sport Discman. but gets better battery life. weighs less. and i can listen  to what I want without switching CDs .as if I could carry more than one CD  when im jogging anyways..  I am definitely a computer geek. so I wasnt  worried about setting it up...but the setup was so simple a 5 year old  could do it.  Looking forward to taking it on long bus rides to crew races  this spring.  Great little player for the money.,5,1,930
A3PPCSNJIESRA6,1919,Please add my views to those who were impressed with the Elph 370z. On a  recent trip to New york it was small and light enough for me to carry in my  handbag so it didnt scream TOURIST. yet produces beautiful photos.  including one lovely panorama of Central Park at twilight that I am going  to have blown up. I agree that in making it as u0026quotidiotproofu0026quot as  possible the makers have sacrificed some of the bells and whistles you get  with a fancy SLR system. but for most of us civilians who just want some  decent photos and nice memories. I would recommend it wholeheartedly. One  teensy drawback is that it wasnt as good at eliminating red eye as I would  have liked. but this is a very minor quibble.,4,1,720
A3PQLMQ9AR34JY,1416,This is an excellent headphone. escpecially given its price.  Ive used mine for 4 months. primarily in my car. and I have no complaints.  It is comfortable to wear and delivers clear sound on both ends of the call.  My only complaint is with .the price..  I purchased mine in February 2001 from them..  It is now June 2001.  I just went back to the site to order two more units and I find they has increased the price..  Shame on you...,5,1,436

A3PR648T8RDRS,22,Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that wont get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe its my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See. that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece .the actual wall mount. that you screw to the wall.  Once thats done. using the bracket mounted on the TV. you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes. I will admit that once its mounted. its a more secure connection. but its the mounting thats the problem.  You cant do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV. you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece. which means that you have to hold the TV to the wallmounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky. especially with heavier TVs .I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds..  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation. five stars for usability. for a combined four stars.  Make sure you get help when installing.,4,1,1312
A3PSDW92HQ2DV6,0,The cleaner seems to work as intended  these things always were a little weird... but it was cheap so why not.  I never have cleaned my DVD drives on my PC and it probably helped.  Ones Ive seen in the past only had one brush. this one has several little brushes.,4,1,263
A3PTG7RICH0EQA,0,This is a wonderful DVD player. I consulted the directions only once for like 5 seconds to make sure how to hook it up to the TV. After that. I just popped in a DVD and it was pretty easy from there. The remote is real easy  to understand. It doesnt have a bunch of unnecessary buttons like one of  those Toshiba DVD players.The only extra thing you need to buy is a cord  to hook it up to the TV. But thats not a big deal. I went to Sears and got  a cord for under USD10. You can get an SVideo cable or the cable with the  red. yellow. and white things on each end .I got the multicolor  one..Other than that. this is a great DVD player. Just make sure your TV  is the right holes in the back. Mine didnt so I had to set it up at my  friends house .it sucks being a poor college kid..,5,1,785

A3PYPW4Q1IQ9QP,11,I got this CD player 2 years ago for christmas. I have to say this is a VERY VERY VERY reliable product! I droped it so many times. and it still worked. Once the cover was open and I droped it and broke a hinge but it was no biggie. The EASS was enough for me. the sound was superb and the battery life was very good. My grunt about it is this. sometime in may I left it in my fathers Iszus troopers glove box and left it there for a week. I came back to get it out .my MP3 player was out of batts. and the center ring .where you put the cd on. was bent. I dont know if it was from heat or what but that was my gripe. other than that everything about it is great! I would of gladly bought another one ...,5,1,704
A3PYZZ3FA5KTIZ,22,I purchased my GPS II plus in Sept 1997 and have used it throughout Fla bay and the east coast North to Hilton Head S.C. The elementry maps of the GPS III u0026amp III plus are not of use to me as a boater but some people love this feature.I have used Garmen. Northstar. Lowrance u0026amp Magellan  Units. The Garmen is by far the easiest to use. Very intuitive menus u0026amp  text identifiers. Accuracy is Exellent The 12 Channel reciver is fast  enough to provide accurate positions at high boating speeds. unlike some  older multiplexed recevers I have used. Differential GPS is marginal in  extreme S. Fla and therefore I have not persued this technology.However  my unit has had problems. the unit will shut itself off without warning and  will not always reboot when switched back on. This has been very disturbing  at night in the boat near shallow water. The last time it did this it would  not work for several months only to come on the day I was going to ship it  to Garmen for repair. Never depend on only one means of navagation!The unit has been durable and not effected by salt spray or fresh water  washdowns.Except for the one issue I am very happy with my Garmen and this  is probably an isolated problem. I intend to purchase 2 more units one for  each of my boats and a back up to be carried in my u0026quotdry boxu0026quot for  good luck. Lots of bang for the buck! This would be a 5 Star revue except  for my one problem.,3,0,1444

A3PZML7LQ1HX52,35,The mic works OK.  It picked up my speech loud and clear...with a bit of static.  As for the actual u0026quotphonesu0026quot portion of it. they are only good for listening to LoFi stuff.  Dont count on your mp3s. CDs. MDs. etc  sounding ANY better than a record.  I would suggest using this for  speechtotext. but thats it!  Bottom line. get a desktop mic and a pair  of Sony headphones if you want music and mic.  Oh. and where is the return  counter?,2,0,453
A3Q015U42YXZ5C,55,As with most budgetpriced caller ID boxes these days. the display is seriously lacking in contrast. and harder to read than boxes made a decade ago.  The contrast control. with about 20 settings. gives you the choice of a toodark background .showing all 8s. or a toolight foreground.  The unit comes with a nondetachable cord. denying you the option of locating the box far away from the jack using a longer cord.  The 1year warranty is nonsense because you must prepay a u0026quotshipping and handlingu0026quot charge almost equal to the price of the unit.  I wish manufacturers would spend an extra nickel to add two more wires to the feedthrough. which would make it possible to use a 2line phone .although with caller ID only on line 1..  Another nice feature would be a way to delete all calls from a specific number simultaneously.  Without these features. this Southwestern Bell unit performs its basic function adequately. though not superbly.,3,0,951
A3Q1OBY6D19RWR,4244,dont listen to any thing else...i went to the store to try out every walkman i could and this one by far is the best ever...its got all the best functions...every one i know who listened to all agree with me...it makes tapes sound like CDs....its the best of the best..its strong ...a bit heavy .the metal makes it stronger though......its got a clock.stopwatch.20 presets.auto reverse.dolby.noise reduction. digital tuning. meaga bass and groove for the best bass possible....you can use metal tape...its water resistant...its air tight .it even got a little thing on the bottom to let air out incase the air pressure changes Quickly!....its the best walkman ever!!!!!! if you are looking for an awesome walkman this is it!!!!!,5,1,728
A3Q1OBY6D19RWR,2125,even though you have to crank your system way up to get any volume on these things. the sound quality is great.... deep lows and clear highs.....because of the 40mm elements the bass is awsome!!...for 5 bucks these things are the best deal on the market...if you have a tight budget the jensen jm10 s are highly recemended....,4,1,326

It did not and I know my cell phone wire does however I wanted to have it always plugged in and not have to think about it.  Its a cheap wire and i guess you get what you pay for. unfortunately I got nothing for just a little... not even worth the time to return it. which may have been the idea,1,0,409

A3Q9T490FFHW3G,1,I purchased the Maxell VP100 from Amazon and it arrived promptly. However it DID NOT WORK at all. I placed it into my VCR and... nothing!!! It will not operate in play. FF or rewind. It appeared to be jammed. So I figured I just got a defective one. I used Amazons return service .which was great and very easy to use!. to get a replacement. Unfortunately. the replacement did not work either. It is jammed just like the first one. This ia a awful product and I am suprised that it carries the Maxell name. Two strikes and you are out. this product is NOT RECOMMENDED at all! I found it strange that the label on the VHS cassette is a very generic looking black and white. I will return it again. but this time I will try another brand! NOT RECOMMENDED at all!UPDATE. I just found out I can no longer return this second defective product unless I pay shipping because my window .one month?. has expired. I dont use my VCR much so I let this sit for a while. Its not worth the cost to ship it back. so its going in the trash.,1,0,1024
A3QAAQZA4DJPSQ,0,I installed the RCA RC926 Wireless Phone Jack in a workshop less than 100 feet from the base unit.  After much difficulty. I finaly got a dial tone.

A3QAY8CG1B4ZVW,11,I bought this unit recently .actually the V61 model. which is the same  tube. and returned it because of the poor color.  Im not going to go into  details here. but if youre interested. read my review on audioreview.com  under the V61 unit.Basically. the tube is incapable of producing a white  color  its pink instead.  If you watch a hockey game. youll see what I  mean.  The ice is pink.  Look at the unit in a store and compare it to. say  a nearby Sony or JVC  youll see the pink tone in the Toshiba.  Whats  worse  you cant adjust the pink out of the picture.  Adjusting the tint  control just makes everything green.I like Toshiba as a brand. but their  large directview TV tubes are poor .32u0026quot u0026amp 36u0026quot..  However.  the clarity is EXCELLENT.  The clarity impresses you in the store enough to  buy the set. until you get it home and all the flesh tones are pink.  I  adjusted the controls to no avail and even bought a DVD disc specifically  for setting the sharpness. brightness. color and tint. but it didnt  help.I thought I had a bad set until I looked at all the other sets at  the store.  Again. if youre interested. read my review on audioreview.com  ...  COMPARE THE COLOR BEFORE YOU BUY THIS SET!,2,0,1231

A3QBKALR9EQM88,0,I purchased 10 tapes and only one tape functions properly. when trying to rewind the tape. the system stops and the player is turned off. turning the system back on and the tape ejects itself. poor recording quality. unable to rerecord. I have received a refund for 3 tapes and you replaced 3 tapes. the replaced ones didnt work either. having only 30 days to request a refund. wasnt time enough to check the recording quality of all the tapes. and the major problem was trying to rerecord using these tapes. I have tapes that are at least 20 years old that I still use to record. very dissatisfied.,1,0,599
A3QCVS6BINLB9I,0,Well. I thought Id vent my frustation with this modem as have most of the other respondents.  Best DatasConexants lousy USD10 modem is completely disapponting.  Though installation was a breeze on my new 600MHz P3  wwin98. the performance is pathetic.  Multiple retrys and frequent  disconnects are the norm.  Theres also this really bizzare behavior where  the modems speaker will turn on in the middle of a session and will not  turn off .have to disconnect..  Tech support web site is mostly useless and  I couldnt believe there is a pay per use phone support charge.I have  a second 56k modem that I normally use in another PC and it works just fine  thank you.I bought this modem with the expectation it would be a  suitable backup for my cable modem.  It doesnt even meet that low  expectation.Best Datas A56FWPCI Mac 2 modem is junk.  Dont buy it.,1,0,854
A3QDHRMFIVA7UK,56,I ordered two packages of these on different occasions.  From a functional standpoint. they work great with Neros InCD.

A3QHW0LLDBH4ZS,11,This is a tremendous product that is exceptionally simple and effective. I bought one for my laptop when I entered college. I secured it to a part of my desk. and could then ease my mind when my roommates friends would come and go. if we had study groups. or if someone managed to break in. I worked at the superintendents office of my dorm and heard tons of complaints about laptops being ripped off. and this is a terrific solution to protect your valuable investment.The cable is also extremely strong. I ended up losing my keys to the lock and had to have a locksmith come to my dorm to undo the lock. It took him 2 hours with professional equipment to cut through the cable. Then. I took the laptop into his shop. and it took him another 40 minutes to extract the lock part from the slot in my computer. Now. I make sure to write down the little security code on the key so I can order a replacement set. but that experience really confirmed my faith in the safety of the setup.Overall. an indispensable item for college. and a great device for other laptop owners. as well.,5,1,1079
A3QHYUA30UYW3J,6063,No where on the view of the package did it indicate that one needs Windows to use this product.

A3QM1FW83S733V,0,After reading the other reviews of this item. I had to respond.  Without arguing with them. I shall mention that I have owned this item for the last 1 year and have had no problem at all  no pictures or frames skipping. freezing or other malfunction.  The setup was a breeze and using the controls of brightness. sharpness and contrast. I could get the picture absolutely perfect theaterlike.  After having seen Toshiba and Onkyo dvd players of higher price in action. I am keeping my JVC!  The 3D phonic does a very realistic job of simulating surround sound and the component video output gives stunning resolution.  My u0026quotacidtestu0026quot consists of the battle scene from Russel Crows Gladiator. You can see every detail of the ashflakes. arrows flying from closeup to a distance against white background and the color of bursting flames to the reality of a cinema.  If you pause. the image is nonpixilated even on a projector screen.  You can advance frame by frame with ease and zoom in accurately.This dvd player comes with 5 channel output.  So even if you do not have a surround procesor. you can use the JVC 701 to do the job just right for you.  The remote is fairly easy and intuitive to use for anyone who knows how to use a remote.  There are built in screen savers to protect your LCD or CRT screen from getting burnt..another great feature.  I recommend you use it.,5,1,1388
A3QMLDRQQDH4ZZ,0,I have owned about 40 AMFM radios in my lifetime.  This includes ones in my cars. connected to my home stereo system. on my boat. etc.  I bought my first GE Superadio from Sears in the mid to late 90s.  I loved it so much I went back and bought a second one.  Both Superradios give far superior reception to AMFM radios that I paid much more for.  The sound is great and the value for money rates a solid 5 stars.  This radio really does an outstanding job of pulling in AM or FM stations that other radios cannot touch.,5,1,520
A3QMN5R8EWXZ3,22,I used to have a psion 3a which was pretty good but basic. I sold and upgraded to a Philips Velo which I was very disappointed with. While using this. I was lucky to WIN a Palm V and have been very pleased. I junked the Velo and use the Palm synchronised to MS Outlook. I work at the desk during the day with Outlook and before leaving I just hit the synch button. Likewise. out on the road and recording all important bits and bobs. I immediately update my desktop on my return. This combination is the best I have used.,4,1,521
A3QN75I7JJCDZ3,33,If youre looking for an exact replica of a fiftyyearold radio. or if you want the latest in shortwave technology. this is not the radio for you. However. if you want to add a cool retro touch to your home or office. and you also want a radio with modern electronics and decent sound. this could  fill the bill. Although it is constructed from modern materials. it is  wellmade and doesnt look cheap. at least to me. I dont use it for  shortwave. but it does a great job of pulling in AM and FM stations in my  steelframe office building. Its a great conversation piece that everyone  notices. It met my expecations and Im glad I bought it.,4,1,639
A3QNJIN3EG6RF0,4243,This is a well built product but it will just hold your camera and batteries.

A3QQGPI3CTV9SX,0,I recently purchased the LG Dare phone on Verizon and love the touchscreen phone with many wonderful attributes and similar in many ways to the iPhone.Being the LG Dare is new to market they dont have a load of accessories yet.  I figured I do allot of driving and that a car charger like I have had for all my past phones should be in my possession.  Of course like with every phone I have ever owned each requires different plugschargers. nothing is compatible with the next.  Typical of all of the companies trying to make extra bucks as you are forced to purchase additional accessories proprietary to the new product.Verison online and in stores have the auto charger. however. it is USD29.99. which is ridiculous to say the least!I went onto Amazon and found a charger that is made for the LG Dare and even has a cool blue light when it is plugged into your cars cig outlet to charge your phone.It is a fast charger compared to some of the ones I have had in the past.For less than USD3 verses USD30 plus tax I have a great charger for my new phone when I travel by car.,5,1,1076

A3QT03GO9XRJO3,0,This was delivered promptly and intact. It probably works great but it did not resolve my issues. I still have snow on my screen whenever I play a tape and I now think that I either have to purchase a new machine or get this one repaired. I cant make a 100% recommend for this product because I have other issues. I thought I only needed to clean my tape heads but it turns out that the problem is more complex.,4,1,411

A3QUK8180C0B1G,0,Before I bought to my Nook 3gwifi . I couldnt decide between nook or kindle. Even though the some of the reviews say that nook gives problem  . i didnt care and i wanted to give it a chance because of its colorful and touch screen and I bought Nook 3gwifi instead of Kindle. I wish I wouldnt buy it . This device drove me crazy.  First. I turned on the device and it was little slow not really frozen. I didnt care and then after a while. It started to give more problems. Anytime when I turned the pages it goes really slow. sometimes doesnt even change the pages. After a short time using it . it started to shut down and restart itself. it is so crazy. I tried to use 3G. I have an Android smart phone and I always use 3G without any problem around my neighborhood. but this defected device .nook. didnt connect 3g. and I hardly connect the internet by wifi. I called customer service and I tried to explain the situations. they just told me some stories. please be patient ...be patient. sorry... sorry... When I bought the device . they were not really patient to charge money.  just sell it then nothing.Finally I returned it. Now I am planing to buy kindle but I feel so nervous. I dont want to have same problems again.NOOK looks so nice and stylish. color screen and eink screen together. it provides some of android apps . it seems a functional device. but absolutely not.  I have a 2nd generation ipod touch. I have been using it for 2.5 years.  at least 3 times I dropped it to the concrete. I havent had any problem. It is totally worth to my each penny.Anyway. I had a bad NOOK experience . and I just wanted to share it.I hope nobody gets the same situation.,1,0,1673

A3QWCGS4OS44UP,0,I gave this product a 4 star rating. I used it to mount a 40 inch flat screen TV. The bracket is well built. easy to install and has clean lines .no exposed mounting bolts..  An area of the bracket that could be improved is the swivel joint at the back of the TV plate that is used to adjust forward tilt and level of the TV. It works and is sturdy once adjusted but adjustment is by trial and error. Adjustment is achieved by loosening 4 bolts. moving the TV to the desired TV tilt and level and then tightening the bolts while steadying the TV. After tightening the bolts and releasing the TV there is some movement of the joint. Getting the desired tilt and level took several tries.,4,1,686
A3QXQJU8AR8PVG,0,I have not bought this yet but have a lingering question that I have not seen brought up.Can somebody tell me if they include all the pictures from the playmates that are on the website as well? Another wards the pictures in the Playboy only have a few pictures of the Playmates but the website and fan sites have all the pictures of them on them from the magazine to the stuff that never made it in the magazine. I am talking about the playmate pictures from the mid 90s and on. as I am not sure on the earlier years because I dont see them on the web. Are the pictures any good as in the quality?  Thanks so much......,3,0,620
A3QYSDHZTMCL8E,15,Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader .WiFi only. . Black u0026 White.After a week and a half of playing with my new nook. and reading two novels on it. I decided to return it for a refund.  I found the reading experience much less pleasurable than a paper book.  The screen contrast is too low to read in lowlight situations. the page turning mechanism is clunky. the page has an annoying way of flashing at every page turn. and the tactile experience is just not satisfying.The deciding factor. however. was the problem I had with connectivity.  The nook would not connect to wireless hotspots in several of my favorite coffee shops. and I found it impossible to transfer ebooks from my iBook.  I spoke with the experts at Barnes u0026 Noble. who told me that the nook works better with some hotspots than others. and that yes. there can be compatibility problems with Macs.  In the end. I was reduced to using the nook to buy ebooks at my local Barnes u0026 Noble store. where I discovered that seemingly all of the millionplus free books are OCR translations that have not been proofed.  They were so full of typos that they were virtually unreadable.In the end. I decided that the nook is really not marketready.  Im heading back to the library!,1,0,1247

A3R0JJANPO4ENU,14,Compared to many of the other mounts. this one was a great value! Comes with a bunch of different parts to fit different sized tvs. Range of motion is exactly what I was looking for and I have no qualms about fully extending the arm forward with full weight of the tv. A bit difficult to install by yourself if you have a larger tv and if you have to keep in mind how much area you need if you were to fully extend it left and right .arm length plus tv width..,4,1,460

A3R16SQ4DHAN2O,412,I decided to jump into a new hobby.....reading. I decided to look at both the Kindle and the NOOKcolor. I already decided against an iPad because the funds simply are not there and I really do not have any need for an iPad. The two things about the Kindle that drew me in were the screen and the ability to buy from Amazon. I decided to check out the NOOKcolor to see the differences. Yes. the screen can have a bit of a glare. but this does not bother me much since I do not read outside anyhow. The main things that drew me to the NOOKcolor was the ability to check my email. Facebook. color. and the awesome read along feature for the childrens books. Since my laptops fan crapped out. I needed something temporary to perform my daily online checks. The NOOkcolor was right up my alley.Please note I have only had my Nook for a week and have not explored all its capabilities or features. I am only commenting on what I have played around with since I bought it.Cons.The screen has a glare. This may be important to those who read outside. but the brightness adjustment can cut it down significantly as long as one makes the adjustments. .This does not bother me since. as I have mentioned. I do not read outside..My plug is a little loose and my battery notification pops up every now and again if I move around too much while reading plugged in.Again. if I move a bit too much. it can jump a few pages. In my experience. it has only done this twice and it only went back 2 pages and I was moving to get more comfortable when it happened.Pros.The screen brightness control makes it nice to read whether it is daytime or you are reading in the dark. My eyes do not get tired or hurt.Color pages for children books. magazines and other fun things to do on the Nook.Easy navigation. I did not find it difficult to navigate my Nook at all. I know where everything is and how to get there. It is just a matter of learning how to get there....like anything else.WiFi. I did not have an issue connecting to my home network .n. or signing up. Web pages load pretty quickly and I am able to check my email and Facebook with no issues.LendMe option. You can lend your books to your friends and vice versa. Nice feature!Conclusion. It is a good buy for an eBook. If you are expecting it to everything an iPad does. then do not buy this because you will be extremely disappointed. Its main function is to be an eReader....not a fully functional computer or tablet.Suggestion. If you have issues with your Nook or Nook account....go INTO the actual store and get help. Facetoface is better than talking to someone who cannot see the issue themselves. You will be better off in the long run and get the customer service you want or need. ..,4,1,2730

A3R3A8D3D9JVWU,22,Ive been very happy with my older talkabouts for skiing u0026amp backpacking. With this newer radio. it works just as well. Im saving 2 ounces. and it fits better in a parka pocket. The review signed by u0026quotDissapointedu0026quot which says that the radios are buzzy at short  range fails to note that these radios arent supposed to be used at close  range .the manual does note that there is excessive interference within 5  feet. but Ive found that theres extra noise within up to 50 feet.. so for  funwithkidz type uses. a cheap Radio Shack radio might well be a better  choice. This Talkabout is the best choice for outdoor rec uses though. The  only problem is that too many people are using them at ski areas now. so  sometimes weve had to switch channelscodes.,5,1,771

A3R4UM58FTRBNS,0,I use this set of headphones almost every week on flights.  I have found that the noise cancelling is excellent for plane travel. and in fact reduces the ambient roar by orders of magnitude.  In comparison to the Bose comparable. these do not do as good a job. and there is a hiss as pointed out by others. but this is completely unnoticable on a plane.  In addition. I have worn continuously on u0026gt13 hour flights and have not had any discomfort in the fit. which is a great plus compared to other headphones I have owned.  Battery life is excellent. and they cant really be accidentally switched on while in your luggage.I was hoping that they would fold up smaller. but I guess this is about as good as you get for over the ear types.The only real drawback to these is if you cover the ear can in any way .hand. leaning against headrest. etc... these things can start to flutter or amplify the background noise.  I havent noticed this with other products. but it is likely that they are the same.,4,1,1003
A3R52J21NWLWW2,1919,They charge the same postage on each SD card. so if you buy one  it is USD1.90. and two is USD3.80  and so on.  If they would calculate true postage. I would have bought many units. but with the postage driving the price up. it is just not worth the price.  Other places calculate true postage based on size and weight. which is what should be done.Find another vendor  this one is not very fair.,3,0,396
A3R5C9CPMDHDPZ,0,I agree that the material used in this hard case is kind of cheap... but the other reviewers who have said that this case saved their Palm V from certain destruction have convinced me to use it. here are my other thoughts  on this product.CLOSING THE CASE. At first. I couldnt get the case to  close all the way. After removing it and replacing a couple of times it  finally worked and now it closes nicely. The spine on the case must  not  have been centered when I inserted it into the slot on my Palm.HOT SYNC.  Very very easy...just put your cradle on an upside down coffee cup .note to  morons. please dump out your coffee first. and then open the front and back  so the Palm V is completely exposed. This works just fine and wont crowd  your desk.Overall nice product design but I wish the u0026quotanodized  aluminumu0026quot surface felt like metal rather than coated plastic. You may  not want to pay USD30USD40 for this case. but think about the alternative if  your Palm takes a spill!,2,0,996
A3R5UY152HB2TA,5053,After about two months. the LCD malfunctioned.  It only occasionally worked.  After three years. the unit stopped working altogether.  After taking the unit apart to see what is wrong with it. Ive discovered opening and closing the waterproof top contributes to the destruction of the unit.  When you open the top. you will notice a series of connectors in a plastic electronic strip at the bottom of the lid. below this the electronic strip is folded in an awkward way. which after several hundred openings. the slight tension causes the strip to naturally sever. hence the unit ceases to operate.  The sad fact of the matter is Ive owned this unit for three years and only used it for about 100 hours of operation.  Not much!,1,0,727

A3R8CX7AF48XD7,44,Well I absolutely loved these speakers for the first month when they played my music much better than my iPod Touch did. but after about a month it would start playing the music good for like 30 seconds and then the music would sound scratchy and blotchy. I will say I used them a lot which may have contributed to this. but Im disappointed that they didnt last that long. Now I just play my music straight from my iPod until I can find a trustworthy speaker system. Buy carefully.,4,1,481

A3RAESXA4SR1YL,0,I shopped all around and read hundreds of reviews of hand held  cb s.  I used to travel aback and forth from Tempe az to Chicago when I was in college.  I used a  mounted. cb for eight years and I relied heavily on it to keep me awake and interested during the 36 hour trip.  So. nostalgia set in before Xmas and I bought this unit. And a second one for my son who commutes to college.  The reviews are correct on the short range of the wand antenna on the unit.  Not good.  I bought a lil Wilson magnet antenna.  On the highway today. my radio checks indicated I was getting a transmission range of 58 miles.  Not bad at all.  Brought me back to the college commute.  I recommend this device for any of us aging baby boomers .and their kids.  And i should add that the noaa weather channel is great.  Cb radios saved my life a couple of times.  Im back  in!!!,4,1,860
A3RBLGLGUX1FVE,33,It looked great when I pulled the mout of the box. I made sure my tv was under the max weight 68 lbs of this mount. As soon as I mounted my tv. The mount began to bend out of level.

A3RD0LHVIRWWA2,0,My first ereader. so I went to Barnes and Noble is a bookstore. and they have a very large selection.  I can take my reader in the store to recieve advice how to use it.When one takes it into the the store it offers to go online giving a recommendation of daily specials.  I bought my wife the newest nook. the tablet with the only difference being. the tablet has a built in microphone. a tiny bit lighter. and larger storage space. A  micro SD card fits in either nook so storage is not an issue anyway.  Both the color and the tablet allow you to archieve your purchased books online with Barnes and Noble you can achieve your books online and Barnes and. Noble will store them.Easy to work.  Looking for a reader this is it for us anyway. and it has a long battery life expect one turn the screen brightness down.  The unusual  thing is you can add nook friends that have them and loan ebooks online that you have bought. or borrow books from them.  Not all books but ones that have a lend me ribbon on them.  Did I mention that I hate typing on IPADS. so forgive stupid grammar and spelling in here.,5,1,1104
A3RDTR30GIHF1U,22,I dont know about all the people whove given this one star. its pretty decent. I have some ridiculously old. scratchedup PS1 games and I dont really have the money to buy them all over again. A lot of the cutscenes in the games would skip. freeze entirely... a lot of times. the sound was just gone.Though this doesnt really make the product good as new. it makes it at least more playable. I can finally hear the voices in Mega Man Legends! So Im pretty pleased with that. Keep in mind. though... some parts are a little iffy. but Im planning on repeating the process and see if anything else improves. So far. Im pretty pleased with the results.,4,1,647
A3RED3KUGRD9I4,33,not like the name brand ones but for the price you cant beat it. for what I use it for it stays plugged in most of the time and I rarely unplug it if you are going to be plugging and unplugging allot than you might want a better one but for most people it should work great!if I were paying what you pay for a name brand one than I would have complaints but at this price it is somewhat high quality.,4,1,400
A3REWXQEG7B7XI,0,I just bought this unit to replace my SAVA10 amplified system. Since My DVD player is already digital out ready I didnt need to spend the extra cash for the digital receiver.

A3RFAMCC6XGC2T,2025,We purchased this item to replace an old clock radio that my wife used in the bathroom when putting her makeup on.  I was trying to find a replacement that ran on batteries. had a clock and a decent radio.  Although we do not use this radio in the shower. it has turned out to be the perfect replacement.  My wife loves it.  We havent had it long enough to see how the batteries last. but so far so good.  Radio reception is excellant.  Sound is sufficient.  The only downside is that it was quite pricey. but after all it is made for the shower.,5,1,546
A3RIKQGHS1SLWJ,22,I bought this radio to pick up AM radio stations while I spin my hampster wheel in a cubicle farm in upstate NY.

Even faint AM signals ring true on this baby.Pros .This radio picks up signal in areas that even your car cannot.power cord or Battery.Cons .no digital display makes you look like a squareamazingly good reception and clumsy knobs make fine station tuning a little tough .very minor con.If you are interested in an afforable. super reception radio. look no further.,4,1,640
A3RIRZMZZNUS8F,55,I bought the Sharp 722 last April .1999. or so and Ive had several problems with it. First. the headphones broke .a little tape fixed that.. Then someone dropped it or something and the discs wouldnt eject after  that. I took it to the place I bought it to get it fixed and it was going  to cost USD120!  Since it was already messed up. and Im pretty good with  electronics. I decided to crack it open .not literally. of course. I  carefully unscrewed it. and tryed to fix it myself. It probably voided the  warrenty but that didnt matter since it didnt cover the damage anyway. It  turns out that the top of the slot was bent down so I just bent it back up.  I also fixed the remote wire cause it was coming apart. Also. the jog dial  doesnt work sometimes. To fix that I just start spinning the dial around  really fast and after about 20 spins it starts working again. Anyway. thats  my story and now it works fine. Its easy to use and has many cool features  and accesories.,3,0,978

These CDs play fine on this machine. In fact. these CDs  work on my car CD players. my computer CD players. and my 10year old  Yamaha CD player. I was surprised that a new Sony DVD machine cant handle  this. since all of these other machines could. Maybe future versions will  correct this oversight.,2,0,466

A3S06C6N48LPJU,0,Like most other reviewers here. my Defcon CL reset itself. I have been using it for 3 years and today I entered my combination and found that it would not unlock.

A3S2VB2NSUT38,0,I purchased my DVP735 back in 2000.  It was a wonderful u0026quotflagshipu0026quot product. and I even rated it highly on a website such as this.  However. since then it has been locking up in every movie that we watch .generally near the end..  The irony is that a local agent  Next Electronics charged me u0026gt NZUSD300 to have the pickup assembly replaced .with a 3 month warranty..  Guess what  the damned piece of crap failed after 4 months  even worse than before.  SONY. if you are listening. I am not too happy with your product or customer support.  The local u0026quotSony Centreu0026quot in Wellington seems to brush off faulty product that is beyond its warranty date.  Every time my flatmates and I watch a DVD. it locks up  MOST EMBARRASINGLY! DO NOT BUY A SONY DVD PLAYER.  If I could go back in time. I would have burnt the NZUSD1.100 I spent purchasing this DVD player. rather than suffer its problems.,1,0,921
A3S3MK7WOMFHZP,59,Panasonics L50 is first rate. I have seen laptops with DVD and they dont even compare.  The picture is sharp and smooth.  The battery lasts well over 2 hours and can go over 4 when you are connected to a regular tv with  the display turned off.  The remote is the size of a credit card and gives  you complete control over the unit.  The two small stereo speakers will  surprise you with the sound they deliver.  I plugged my Bu0026ampO headphones  into this little jewel and thought I had a front row seat.  I give this  unit a Big thumbs up.  A must have for any movie buff who wants the best  and he wants it in the palm of his hand.,5,1,636

A3S5827VSZE66O,0,I just received this Transport and am mildly unhappy with it.  For those of you who might not have thought of it. here is a little advice.  Check and see where your buttons are .play. ff. rewind. and then look at the picture of the case with the cd player in it.  Guess where my buttons are?  I have the Koss player with the tranparent blue lid.  Yup. buried under the snap lock and the nylon sheeth.  It seems of pretty good quality. but the loops are a little tight on mine and you can already guess where its going to wear out but thats just conjecture.  Theres a tiny zipper pocket in it. that looks like it might hold 2 AA batteries and some keys .off the keyring. and thats about it.  All in all. not a bad idea  well see how well it serves its purpose.  Add a star if your buttons are accessible.,3,0,803
A3S5PAZ9L8VH72,33,I am always amazed that companies force new learning on their next version of software. which makes it user unfriendly.

A3S5USAAZE6029,0,Briefly. the FM and AM reception are very good for the Grundig YB 400PE radio. SW is decent and SSB is fair. at best. The controls and display for the Grundig are good. too. ergonomically. the choices made by Grundig were sound and better than much of the competition. Which is to say. the buttons and controls are easy to master in comparison to similar Kaito and Sony models. The Sony ICFSW7600GR is a better unit. I have to say. but the audio on the Grundig is much preferable to the Sony. Overall. I would take the Sony. but the Grundig is a good portable radio and I would not be disappointed if I were on a desert island with just a Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE as company. Well done.,4,1,685

A3S76NP1H3R0XH,0,After just two cycles of the batteries. they stopped working in my tactical flashlight.  I measured the voltage and found them to be almost 4.2 volts fully charged .when it is supposed to be 3.0!!!..  I dont know if this can damage a voltage regulated light. but Im not willing to take the chance .they dont work in two separate types of flashlights I have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now..  Im returning these and buying some surefire nonrechargeable batteries.  What good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work. the batteries fail?  And if you arent using it for tactical purposes. then why get a light with CR123A batteries in the first place?Even when this charger WAS working .only on the first cycle.. it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says.  Also. the light turns halfway to green but stays halfway red. and doesnt charge both batteries evenly.,1,0,969

A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,1212,I had to buy a printer cable for my Epson 890.  When I priced around. this could not be beat.WILL NOT WORK WITH PARALLEL PORT ONLY COMPUTERS For the person that had a previous review. this is a cable that will only work on a printer that has a USB outlet.  This is not for printers that are strictly parallel port hook ups.ENDS FOR PRINTER AND COMPUTER DIFFERENT The USB end that is for the printer if you look in the photo. is the small end to the left.  It is only about 316u0026quot wide and shorter than that.  The USB end for the computer is the big end to the right in the picture.about 38u0026quot wide and shorter than that..MANY USB PRINTERS HAVE BOTH USB AND PARALLEL PORT CONNECTIONS Many USB printers have both a parallel port cable connection as well.  That is one of those huge flat type ones .roughly 2u0026quot wide..This may sound simple for all you computer experts out there. but with the plentitude of this type of cable or that. it can get very confusing.Great buy.,5,1,986
A3S9A2BTLPBHBF,1372,Decently Comfortable. very convenient. easy to set up and use aside from poorly placed and inconveniently designed battery compartment.  It is exceedingly difficult to insert batteries into the halfbattery height compartment which opens above left ear phone and to get them in place. but its worse to remove them despite presence of a ribbon in the compartment meant to ease the process.  I write the following with the advisory that I evidently had a defective unit. thinking fresh batteries might cure the initially less than satisfactory sound volume. I .with extended effort. replaced the initial. presumeably weak batteries with a fresh pair.  The batteries immediately overheated to the point of being untouchable and I feared the headphones might melt. and only finally removed the batteries after an insane amount of effort and prying with other objects. after which I decided the lower half of the battery compartment cover would likely break before long due to the force required to remove batteries. and decided to return the unit  therefore never getting opportunity to effectively judge the sound.  I have been using the Emerson backphone headphones for years and find them a spectacular value with fine sound.,2,0,1223

A3SA9V6B50SOS3,33,In december I purchased this .Region 1 player. for a reallygood deal and I didnt go wrong.  Im only 16. so this was no smallpurchase for me and I learned it was well worth the money!  Im not just saying this because Im blown away by DVD in general. but because Ive seen other players. and this one holds strong against others. I use the built in DD .Dolby Digital. decoder because I have no DD decoder in our amp .just 6 channel discrete input..  Ive heard it when hooked up to a DD amp with a optical digital cable. and it seems better. but mine was still a lot better than VHS. and I also dont have really high end speakers. but still have lowend Infinty.  The picture looks great on the 35u0026quot JVC TV. but I cant use component video on it. just SVideo. still looks fine though.  Ive tried 3 CDs with HDCD encoding. but the player didint realize that they were HDCD compatible. i dont know why. maybe cause Ive got it hooked up with anolog cables with the 6 CH Discrete.  The zooming isnt really necessary. but that doesnt mean this player is a waste of money!  The dual disc system is an added bonus. not really an extra cost. so hey why not?  All the outputs are gold plated too.  Ive played at least 2530 discs. and havent noticed a flaw in playback at all.  The only .MINOR. u0026quothickupu0026quot was during u0026quotThe Bone Collectoru0026quot where for about 1 or 2 seconds. the picture sort of froze and sound was lost. then it came back. the disc may have been dirty though  rented.  As for the remote. i dont know how much better other players remotes are. but this one is fine. a lot better than the Panasonic A120s is. easier to use in terms of setting up anyway.  The shape is kinda weird of the remote though.  One thing that was a real bonus. like mentioned below. is how easy it was to set up.  Once hooked up .I dont know what the heck people are talking about when they say they couldnt even get it hooked up. you do about 2 minutes of set up with the easy on screen menu of stting up sound. tv screen size .4.3. 16X9. and a bit others. and then your ready! It would be nice to get a widescreen HDTV though. they say the Widescreen DVDs especially. look better on these TVs. the u0026quotcompressedu0026quot image is supposed .and does!.  look even better.  The only annoying thing is. is that I havent gotten my 5 free movies yet. maybe the mail is extremely slow and it didnt get there in time. You cant go wrong. honestly!,5,1,2452

A3SBZLD7FRRF40,13,First of all. I have used software named u0026quotStreamboxu0026quot to cut down the size of my files.  So. instead of playing the selection at 128 kbs. I have cut it down to 16 kbs.  Believe me. the quality does not deteriorate  that much!  By doing this. I now can hold 100 tunes .mine are all jazz.50  on each of my two 32 mb modules.  If I choose to do so. I just cut down on  the number of tunes. for example to 47. and replace them with three old  radio shows.  As long as I keep the number of selections at 50 or less and  do not exceed the 32 mb on each module. there is no problem.  Now for the  negativeYes. it is rather cheaply made.  Bump it and it will turn off  the battery compartment is not well thought out.  But. if you have problems  within the warranty period .one year.. Diamond will replace the unit.  One  more thingthe cost of the 32 mb modules is beginning to drop.  I would be  lost without my Rio!,4,1,924

A3SED7WW1G06AT,44,I dont think Ive ever been as disappointed with any electronics component as I have been with the Pinnacle TV tuner card.Heres what youre SUPPOSED to get. the Pinnacle TV tuner card accepts incoming video signals through an included Svideo in. composite in. or conventional cableAntenna input. Software supplied allows you to switch between those three inputs in the case of the cableantenna input. a built in tuner allows tuning in VHFUHF channels 2 to 83. or cable channels from 2 to 160 .or therabouts.. The video signal is displayed on a resizable screen. which operates much like a conventional window or as a full screen display. Audio handling is sparse at best the card has an audio out jack .no audio in. and you are supplied with a small external jumper cable. which you are expected to run from the audio out jack to the external input jack on your sound card. .Lets hope youre not already using it for something else.. The card also has an internal audio out jack. but no cord is supplied and the unconventional plug is difficult to find.The card offers you the opportunity to watch TV in a variable sized screen to record TV and to pause live broadcasts. giving you the rough equivalent of a Tivo or Personal Video Recorder. When you hit pause. the screen freezes. and the video signal is diverted to your hard drive as a digital datastream. Hit pause again. and the data comes off your hard drive and is displayed on your screen. while new data continues to be recorded to your hard drive. In this fashion you can jump forward and back through the program. playing the same section over again. skipping past commercials. and generally having a merry old time.At least. thats the sales pitch.The difference between the Pinnacle PCTV and the Pinnacle PCTV Pro. is that the pro includes a stereo TV decoder .the nonpro version is mono only.. If you read the enclosed advertisng material. you will be told that the Pro also includes a stereo FM tuner and indeed. the Pinnacle PCTV Pro website states. u0026quotWatch TV or listen to the radio on your PC.u0026quot However. when you purchase the Pinnacle Pro card. you will find that there is NO radio tuner. there is NO FM antenna input .even though one is clearly illustrated in the enclosed advertising.. and indeed there is virtually no hardware difference between the two cards.But the lies and deceit dont stop there. Lets go back to the claims made for the card on the Pinnacle website. u0026quotCreate your own movies from video captured from TV. VCR or Camcorder with the easy to use Studio software.u0026quot Well. true enough... but they fail to mention that the Studio software supplied is a 30 DAY TRIAL. After that point. the software locks up. and you are expected to purchase it. at great additional cost. Without this software. you can still record TV shows but you cannot edit out commercials. string multiple shows into one presentation. or any other commonly done VCRtype tasks. You can start recording. stop recording. and thats it. No pause. no nothing.Lets talk about the hardware for a moment... or lack thereof. You see. theres not much hardware here. and thats a problem. That conventional NTSC or PAL TV signal is analog. and it needs to be converted to a digital format FAST. The digital conversion takes a lot of processing power. and the conversion from raw digital video to MPEG format takes an awful lot more. Most TV cards that permit recording and PVR functionality  such as the Hauppage 350. available through Amazon  accomplish this with built in hardware MPEG encodersdecorders. Not so the Pinnacle card it makes use of your computer horsepower. substituting a software program for a hardware chip. This is fine. at least in theory but to make it work. you need to have well written software. and enough computing horsepower to dim the lights in the neighborhood whenever you boot up the machine. I was using an Athlon XP 1800+ with 768 megs of 333 Mhz RAM. two 40 GB Maxtor Diamondmax 7200 RPM Hard drives in a RAID 0 configuration. and Windows XP home... and it wasnt enough. Even with all nonessential programs and services shut down. the performance was still unsatisfactory. A minimum 2.5 GHz processor and 1 GB of FAST RAM  and a state of the art video card. like a high end Geforce FX or equivalent Radeon  would be a minimum requirement. But even then. the software is so glitchy. buggy. unreliable and undependable as to make the whole procedure an exercise in frustration.Oh. I could go on. I could talk about the audio drifting out of sync with the video every time you change channels. making it impossible to channel surf. I could talk about the included remote that turns the software off. but wont start it again. I could tell you about the amazingly unhelpful technical support. the fiendishly confusing driver downloads section. the dozens of bugs... but you must get the picture by now.This is a lousy product. It was implemented by a rank amateur with no concept of quality. and a keen desire to save money on manufacturing. The software was written by an individual or group without the faintest concept of the procedures necessary to write quality software  and it shows. all over the place. Theres a lot of amateur freeware that is better written than is the software packaged with this product. This software has more bugs than a cheap. inner city flophouse. The lack of ethics in marketing. production. and execution all speak volumes in describing Pinnacle Corporation as a company desperate to sell a fundamentally defective product in any way possible. including lies. treachery and deceit. However. all the glitzy packaging. the loud promises and enthralling hype can do nothing to change this product from what it really is. a sad little electronics disaster.If. after all Ive said. youre still contemplating buying this card. let me offer you one last word of advice. buy the card from a retailer with a very generous returns policy.Because youre going to be taking advantage of it.,1,0,6007
A3SEXRQ4J6H68C,1515,I originally would have given this product one star because it came with so little liquid that it only lasted a few cleanings.

A3SHI5VAR4PII5,0,This player is hands down the best value in its class.  The SD3109 offers more features than any other in its price range.  The most usefull feature is the dual tray...you can watch two movies back to back without  getting up. or use it like I do and keep your most used Audio CD in the  lower tray so its always available.  I had purchased a Yamaha RV902  .digital ready. over a year ago. and I was waiting for the right DVD player  to purchase...this one was it.  The 5.1 audio blows me away every time I  play a DVD.  You will want to see every movie you have seen on VHS just to  hear the difference.  The video is crystal clear with no jitters or  flutters.  The remote is lack luster. but it does the job.  This player is  highly recommended.,5,1,748

A3SI47O5FA9LJA,613,I was skeptical that the Pro8T2 was  fail safe  as described on the box.  Being an engineer. I decided to look inside.  Yes. the design is such that if the surge protection circuitry has given its life to protect your equipment .I would call this  succeeded  rather than  failed . your equipment will be safe  compared to other designs.  When the surge protection circuits fail in other designs. the protection is disconnected and a little light turns off .you check this every day. dont you?..  Your computer. TV. or whatever continues to function  only now you have NO protection against future surges!  The  safe  part about the Pro8T2 is that IT WILL TURN OFF ITS POWER if its ability to protect is compromised.  Yes. that means your computer will not turn on until you replace the surge protector  but that is the point  it will turn on  it survived because you were protected!  With other products you could run for years unprotected because you did not notice  the light was off.   .Tech note.

A3SMN4GQEQBCJ5,13,After recently purchasing a new Palm Vx. I thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap. The Palm V hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the moment.The case attaches to the Palm V via the left stylus storage area. A stylus shaped piece attaches the Palm to the hinge in the case. The case itself opens like a book and allows the Palm to move much like a page in the book. Located behind the Palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper. The case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the IR port as well as the right stylus.Pros.1. Protects as advertised. The point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all. and this case delivers as advertised. The aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the Palm V tightly and securely.2. Allows for IR port usage while resting in case.3. Case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketCons.1. Heavy. One of the selling points for the Palm V series is the sleek. lightweight design. While this case may not seem like too much additional weight. the combination of the Palm V in the case is noticeably heavier. In fact my wifes Palm III and my Palm V weigh about the same now.2. Obstructive. hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself. A friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well.3. Hand holding the unit is more difficult. With the included leather flap. you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the Palm in one hand. The hard case does not fold back on itself. which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the Palm. This is especially annoying for me since I use my Palm frequently while standing or walking here and there.4. ...Overall. I think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her Palm in the smallest package. You will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers. At this time. I am still using the case. but I anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when I grow tired of the Cons listed above.Thanks for your time...,3,0,2398
A3SNSN41NB9TJA,11,April 27. 2011I purchased a Nook 3g after being told by a Barnes and Noble employee that you could surf the web for free without a wifi connection. I bought this as a gift for someone who has no computer or wifi. The information was completely false! I will be not be purchasing anything from Barnes and Noble forever. Dont buy the 3G it does not work for surfing. What kind of company is this?,1,0,394

A3SS5HINOU946V,7,I bought the Sonys when the gym installed a new music system which blared out pop musicobviously the worst CDs in the customers collection. to get rid of which they donated to the gym. For this purpose. they proved okay. not great. but at least good enough that I renewed my membership.Where they really shine is on an airplane. The drone of the jet engines is cut by half or twothirds. and you dont know how tiring that sound is until youve switched it on and off with a pair of noisecanceling headphones. Much the same is true in a bus or automobile. and I never travel without them. The Sonys come with an adapter plug for the airliners audio system. so theres never any question of buying or renting airline phones. Shucks. Ive probably paid for the Sonys in that alone.Note that the phones work best on steady background noise. so theyre great with turbojets but only fair with conversation. This has nothing to do with Sony and everything to do with acoustics. So the crying kid in the seat behind you is going to sound about the same whether you have the noisecanceling turned on or off. .He will be quieter simply because you have these earphones snug over your ears..For severe situations. like the MTV music in the gym. Ive seriously considered using wax earplugs and turning up the volume on the Sonys. but most of the time they suffice. and so Ive never gotten around to it.An excellent investment in your hearing and in your sanity.,4,1,1445
A3SSP1GQEHPENJ,3335,camera was in great condition. arrived on time.  Took some photos with it and just got them back.  They came out fine and I am happy with the purchase.,4,1,151
A3SUM2ZAVBMQKS,0,The cable itself is OK. but the lock is very poor quality. The internal mechanism on my lock unscrewed itself from the body of the lock after about six uses  and no. it was not tampered with. or at least the antitamper mechanism had not been activated. This product is worth about USD5 and does nothing more than avoid tempting honest people. Im sure the proper tool would pop the lock out of the security port in two seconds.,1,0,426
A3SUN2NS6Z0LHP,3038,the scs125 sounds good but! the amp has a defect the amp gos out after a couple of years and jbl does not back it after two years.i have been looking for 8 months that is all i hear . the sub woofer has a defect. SORRY ERIC,1,0,223
A3SV5RRL6IY4WS,0,The cable looks very solidly and precisely made.  It does have the logo HDMI on it as required by the manual of my Sony camcorder.  It just doesnt have the Sony logo on it.  As till now I just plugged it into my camcorder to see if the plug fits  it does perfectly.  The cable is cheap for its typepurpose. and the cost of shippinghandling is low.  I received it promptly and it came well packaged.,4,1,398
A3SVCOAIYXLH0Y,0,This is great! I plugged it in. installed the software. .without reading the manual. and as soon as I erased the welcome mp3 that comes already loaded. I was uploading mp3s. They sound terrific even at high volumes. I ride a motorcycle. and it will be perfect for the bumpy ride. I do have a newer model PC. but if youre buying this type of toy. you should have a nice PC to begin with... Thumbs up! I may get 2 more for the kids. Im sure THEY will be able to handle it.,4,1,470
A3SXB2B9F2MTVW,11,I purchased MANY of these tapes. They are ok if you want to tape something once. and then just watch it occasionally. But. if you. like me. use them to tape over and over. on a daily basis. they degrade VERY QUICKLY. They start degrading. some within 2 weeks. and others within 2 or 3 months. One or two were actually defective when I received them.If you. like me. want something that will last. this grade of tape does not seem to stand up to the test. I would recommend a HIGHER GRADE Tape.,2,0,493
A3SXGIPX5TMV25,0,I bought this case after carrying my kindle around in the box for about 7 months. I couldnt decide on a case until this came along and caught my attention immediately.The case is very sturdy. and holds the Kindle very firmly. The top left elastic holder does limit the motion of the power slider. but that is easy to work around. I find it a very comfortable and durable case overall.,5,1,384
A3SXN8A6BODUBZ,24,This product said it was for my camera type. but it broke my camera. I turned on my camera before charging to see how much power was left. then turned it off and plugged in charger and went to bed. Woke up next morning. and my camera wouldnt turn on. Now all my camera does is flash the red light and wont even turn on.,1,0,319

A3SYRLMIFQGFPZ,23,This product is the best way to store your CDs.  If youve been having problems with all those annoying CD cases. I would reccomend buying this product.  Of course. there is the possibility that you have more than 48  CDs. in which case they have a larger CD case.,4,1,263
A3SYYROPVTOKG9,910,I love this case it is tough and durable and can easily fit in suitcases and it has lots of pockets for rolls of film and extra batteries if you had to choose one fairly inexpensive case I would choose tis one,5,1,209
A3SZFN52D3NSWE,3841,Im the kind of guy that wants something to function well and thats it.  This thing is brilliant at what it does. displays ebooks.  No frills. no apps. no video. no nonsense.  Because of this it makes it very easy to use.  Download Calibre for free and this baby syncs right up with it.  Battery lasts forever. and it has the same charger as most android smart phones. so In the mornings I take my smartphone off its charger and replace it with my little nook.  I am in the military and as someone else said. this fits perfect in the side cargo pocket of my ABUs.  I had the Kobo. which was a great reader. and my wife had the last nook which I didnt like because it was so damn heavy.  I bought this for me so I could give my Kobo to my little girl.  I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for USD47!  This thing is really great.  The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed. but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.  Using this little beauty. and loading all of my own books. and PDFs that I have converted via Calibre. makes me beg the question. Why are people still buying Kindles?  I guess that is the same dilemma I have with Iphones.  Oh well. a fool and his money....  Buy this now!  You will not regret it!,5,1,1319
A3T11ETG17C7C4,34,I ran this through my Honda CD player numerous times and it still skips. I finally gave up on it.,1,0,97
A3T1DE9OZLLLWG,2,Ordered this for our TV that required a 600x400 VESA mount.The item in the picture appears to be this product...ML563BThe Item received was this one...ML523BThe ML523B only supports VESA 75x75100x100200x100200x200mmThere are apparently adapters which can be purchased to allow it to support up to a 400x400 or 300x300. But never a 600x400. The link below shows the ML523BE. which includes the extenders......The seller needs to correct this product description. Weve purchase a cable and a larger tv mount  from them in the past and  both of them turned out to be ok products. They worked fine.  However. this product is misrepresented.If you only need the VESA 75x75100x100200x100200x200mm mount you will be fine. as far as size goes. I cannot review the quality of this product because I was never able to use it. It seemed sturdy. but I can see where some of the complaints about the easiness of the extending the arms and also installation can be justified complaints. You are instructed to attach the tv after it the entire stand has been hung on the wall. The plate does not appear to detach from the mount to attach to the tv as with other mounts I have experience with. This issue could get annoying.,1,0,1208
A3T1H8NBNDX30B,23,I suspect that all of the negtiv reviews here at amazon have something to do with amazon having a compeeding product... but I must say that I love my nook touch. If youre looking for something that covers a broad range of media. has lots of features. or allows you to easily buy books from someplace like amazon. I suggest you look elsewhere. But if you want something thats straightforward and easy to use for reading. this is a great little ereader! Im also not sure why everyone here is complaining about freezing and having to restart so often Ive never had any problems with that! The thing I like the most about the nook is the expandable micro SD card. and the fact that it can use epubs. If you go with the kindle. youre stranded going to online retailers that sell the MOBI format. whereas most places garanteed carry the epub. But to be honest. its not hard to convert between the two formats if you know how youve just gotta have a piece of software to do it for you.Bottom line. This is a great little ereader for reading books. and nothing more.,5,1,1058
A3T1OR5CMMDWMV,4546,This has been my worst purchase since the click and pop machines for the old LPs.  Trust me.  They are very heavy and not comfortable for any length of time.  You have to constantly adjust the transmitter when you change environments.  CD to Movies. etc. and this is no small chore.  It takes forever.  Trust me.  I also own the Advent wireless speaker.  Only because I didnt want to drill holes in the wall or run wire all over the place.  Save your money on the Advent purchase.  They are not the same company they once were.,1,0,527
A3T3M0LO0DRKMA,911,I have used 11 different digital cameras and the 950 is the best currently offered in the USD400 to USD900 range. Price is a little steep. but quality outways the difference in price from competitors. the 950 will  download 40 pix shot in Fine mode from Simple Technologies cardreader to a  G4 in 11 seconds. Its a battery hog I recommend buying Energizers NH15AA  instead of Duracell Ultra. I shot 150 pix in the fine mode 46 of them using  the flash until they were depleted.  Its ideal for Web publishing. however  I shot several photos for magazine use and the results were  nondistinguishable compared to film. If your a tweekhead you will spend  hours trying different traditional photo techniques with this camera and  your results will be quite surprising. Some of my favorites are Slow  Shutter Sync. 8 second time exposure. and a very accurate white balance  that is crucial when shooting in mixed lighting situations. Also try the  macro mode. black u0026amp white mode and Optional Fish Eye Lens for more  diversity.  Have fun!,5,1,1039

A3T5N5ZG7S10Y2,0,It is not so much the money wasted for this lowcost item. It is the time squandered trying to make it work with Windows 7 .64bit.. The drivers for this contraption installed successfully. But every floppy. and I tried many different floppy disks. failed to load. Every time. the process of copying data stopped halfway through. This device is most certainly produced for one of our countless landfills decorating our landscape. u00268211 If you have time to spare. or should I say waste. please give it a try. Due to its lowcost. the company should be asked to pay my invested time for testing this product rather than just the price for returning it.,1,0,651

A3T643FOKZCYEC,12,I was looking for Velcro ties that had the loop that i could slide the many iPadiPhone cables i carry through. These ties will keep your cables bundled individually but i would prefer an additional loop or eye for the cable than i would wrap the excess around.,1,0,260
A3T6554GZTFRMT,0,for college your allowed 1 power strip well it would be nice if you could use every oulet on the powerstrip and on a round one you can.  Its absolutely perfect.  Then you get these color strips to mark your cords to match your outlet so its just great.  My roommates just went online to amazon to order the same ones because the strip ones they could only use 3 out of the 8 outlets and with computers and printers phones hairdryers etc more is a necessity.,5,1,457
A3T6ZQONABIJSG,44,Great software horrible hardware.  Replaced it with a 720.

A3T7452S0K9357,0,Purchased to clean the cassette player of my 97 Oldsmobile. unfortunately the cleaning device is not really the right size.  I can put any standard cassette into the player without issue not this cassette cleaner.  It jams everytime.  Did I say it?  Everytime!  It does work well cleans the cassette deck. just has to be wedged out of the player when I use it.  Not sure if this is a factory second or mismachined. or maybe not intended for vehicle cassette players.  I will keep using it until it breaks.,3,0,505
A3T7LM7H1QTQ4Y,12,This is two products in one. which sounds good for USD50. .1. Its a discman. .2. Its a car cassettetoCD converter. Thats great if it works  as both products.But for me. it hasnt worked. On the first one I got.  the volume control didnt work. so it was no good as product .1.. discman.  On the second one. the volume control works. but it sounds horrible in the  car on anything that has electric guitar on it .ie most of what I listen  to.. So this second one fails as product .2..At the time of writing this  review. Im not sure whether or not I will again send back an  unsatisfactory product to Amazon. I suspect that the discman part of it is  fine. and that a decent car cassettetoCD conversion thingy would set  things right.But as far as quality goes. I have to score this product as  an unacceptable zero for two. It gets one star on the dubious basis of  u0026quotWhat can you expect for USD50.u0026quot,1,0,912
A3T7POAJUPYA06,3437,After purchasing a cheaper reader for eleven dollars including shipping that just didnt work on Windows 7. I got a refund and purchased this instead.  It was twenty dollars with free shipping.  As soon as I plugged it in it worked.  I read a good dozen floppies without any issues and was able to transfer the files I needed to my hard drive.  I do recommend this however if you are using windows 7 Ill give you a few pointers.  First off there is no install disc. simply plug into your usb and it will recognize the device.  It will show up under devices and printers so you need to go to start and click on devices and printers and then click on the USB floppy reader right click and open and it should be drive A.  You will more than likely need to do this for each floppy you put in.  It may take up to a minute to read the entire floppy its not as quick as a standard external drive or usb stick by any means...however it will read your old floppies and if you wish you can even transfer files to it and take it with you.Bottom line. this works great you just need a little patience.,5,1,1088
A3T8G23JTU5C26,0,This is REAL. Im 13 years old and i live in Pennsylvania . LISTEN! A VERY good player has good sound and is very portable. There are a few small set backs . the plastic outside is flimsy . stronger than it looks . if u drop it on hard linoleum it will be fine but i wouldnt go mountain biking with  it. The battery case thingy pops open and is poorly designed . if u bump it  too hard it turns off . that can be fixed by putting a small spring inside  or something though.The headphones are ok . they sound decent and are comfy  4 me . the software is decent but i like RealJukeBox better.I wish it had  better EQ but the ROCK setting is good 4 me . CLASIC setting is best 4 punk  rock.. Sometimes the rio doesnt connect to the port cord cuz gunk gets in  the uncovered connection but it can be cleaned. with a Qtip not with  water..Its easy to set up . if u can use a remote 4 a TV all u need to  know is the port conection which is fast and EZ. Music is of good quality  at 64kbps and free with Napster or Scour Exchange.Battery life is GREAT one  batter has lasted me about two weeks. not with constent but frequent use..  My battery life indicator measures wrong but that doesnt really matter to  me . its no prob . it measures almost dead wen the battery is brand new but  the battery still works.no other complaints. over all a Great product .  small lightweight . relativly strong. Their are players that record and  have Fm tuners . u can get a FM tuner 4 extra money and u can have it  support other formats 4 more money too .It cant record . but no biggy.with  64kbps u get about 2430 songs... get a smartmedia card.  i got 32mb  which adds the capacity to about 5660 songs. but i geuss 16 MB would do.my  bro has an MD rio ranks lower cuz extra memory is expensive but the rio its  self is half that of a MD player. Great product . buy it. Excellent  present.,4,1,1870

A3TBS2ZGGNFYYT,0,I have two older model Walkmans and I dropped both of them by accident and the cassette tape player feature no longer works.  To my surprise. when I went to several local stores. I couldnt find a similar Walkman for sale.  I guess with the iPods and other new technology. the tape players are being phased out.  I bought a newer model Sony Walkman at Target and the sound quality of the tape was so awful I took it right back.  These players that only use one battery have terrible sound quality Ive found. The FM radio stations had terrible reception. too.I found this Sony WMFS499 Sports Walkman for sale here on Amazon.com and purchased it and I love it!  Since I use my Walkman for walking and running. I need a durable player that can withstand being dropped and getting damp in the rain. and the case on my new player seems indestructible.  The sound quality of both the FM radio and tape player are fantastic!  I decided to buy another one to have as a spare in case I lose this one.  That sounds kind of crazy. but having a good tape player for exercise is important to me and I dont want to ever risk being without my Sports Walkman.,5,1,1142

A3TE9JX65YWASZ,0,If you think you are going to be able to use the Jornada to pick up email from your company server while out of the office. think again. Although the manual says you can set it up to do this. the techs at HP dont have a clue  about how to make it work.  After paying the best technical guy I know for  a full days time. he also couldnt make it work.  If you remember to leave  your desktop computer on. you can pick up email in the Active Sync mode.  But if you forget. youre out of luck. This seeems to be due to the fact  that Windows CE. like many Microsoft products. just has too many bugs. The  Jornada is NOT ready for prime time. Save your money and get a ligthweight  laptop that runs Windows 95 if you want to be in touch while on the road.,1,0,749

A3TFLI11T4K9AK,0,I purchased the nook and it came VERY quickly. 2 days tops. I am giving 3 stars due to the fact that there was something wrong with the battery.

A3THICY5Y6L9UQ,1622,I saw the koss PP257 in the picture and then saw the price and thought not bad.  I went ahead and bought it but when i took it out for a run it didnt give me what i expected.  I live on the north shore of long island and  experienced a lot of static and fading in and out of the stations.  Ive  used other products like the sony ones and didnt experience any of the  fading in and out.  What really attracted me to the item was its price.  I  do recomend this product if you exercize at home but if you run in the out  doors spend the extra money and get yourself another product.,2,0,580
A3THOMATM7Y94V,33,The earpiece and mike are good if the connection would stay in the radio. I am using this with my MR350. Not sure if it is because the connector on the headset is so large or the rubber cover on the radio. but the connection continuoulsy pops out of the radio at the slightest touch. leaving the mike open and no one able to communicate with you. Not sure if this is just with these radios but I would not recommend this set with the MR350s,2,0,440

A3TKGJYEB1E9E0,0,I received the Palm V as a birthday present.  At first I thought that it would take forever to learn how to enter information using the graffiti language but within a couple of hours I had mastered the basic letters and  most of the symbols.  I am not a sale person or one who keeps track of any  business type of information.  I planned to use the schedule and the  expenses the majority of the time.  I found that the handbook for the Palm  V is very user friendly and most quesitons could be answered by use of the  handbook.  The only complaint that I have that you cannot edit the  categories under the expenses type or add any expense type.  It is strickly  aimed at the business persons.  It would be great to be able to add or  delete expense types.  Other than that this is a great tool for any person  and really easy to learn how to use.  The cost is finally coming down to  make it worth buying.  Dont pass this up for any reason.  Give it a try. I  know that you will get hooked just like I did of the Palm V.,4,1,1022

A3TLPFNP3V2BWK,0,I only use Superadio III for FM.Plusses..1.  Selectivity and sensitivity are excellent. and comparable to the Tivoli PAL .which costs over USD100...2.  The sound quality for the spoken word is quite adequate.Minuses.Note that to me the only significant Minus is 1..1.  The IIIs reproduction of music is poortounacceptable.  Ive even tried playing music through up to eight IIIs .yes. eight!. to see if the lack of musical sound quality was due to simple lack of amplification its not..2.  Both IIIs that have stopped working for me did so because the onoff .silver. button while appearing to be in the downon position in fact wasnt low enough to turn the III on.  Fortunately one can solve this problem by wedging a dime between the button and the case..3.  Should you try to tune to the same station using multiple IIIs at the same time .as I do.. theres a noticeable variation between IIIs in where on the dial that same station appears.Considerations..1.  Sounds best when both bass and treble are at halfway on .that is. if the control were numbered from 1 to 10. it would be at 5...2.  The bass control adds more distortion that bass..3.  The headphone jack takes a stereo .mini. plug .even though not surprisingly the sound through the headphones is monaural.. which I consider to preferable to a monaural jack. because effectively all headphones have stereo plugs..4.  According the the Users Manual. that NormalWide button works only on AM. not FM.,4,1,1456
A3TLZ39PXJJ7QV,810,I must say that for a simple nonswitched 10Mbps Ethernet hub. this one is pretty good.  The metal box and small size makes it pretty handy.  Unfortunately its pretty outdated for the things you can buy for a few more bucks.  Youre probably better spending your money on a Linksys EtherFast 5port Worgroup Switch. which has a dedicated 100Mbps .or 200Mbps in fullduplex mode. of bandwidth in each port....  But if youre adament about a plain 10Mbps hub. this is a very good way to go.,4,1,483
A3TM20GH659WDI,22,I was looking for some headphones to replace my old Sony MDRV2s that were losing their foam covering.  I wanted them to limit outside noise while not leaking the sound out to outsiders either. as I need them for practicing piano without disturbing my roommates.  This is why the closedback design seemed favorable.In reading reviews of other headphones while trying to make my selection. I found that a major problem with closedback designs is that the sound resonates and distorts. making it sound like tin cans over your ears.There is no exepction with these.  When I tried playing my keyboard through them. they sounded way worse than any headphones or ear buds I had ever used with it.To their credit. keyboard voices other than piano sounded a little better. so maybe these headphones would be great for listening to techno music or something. but certainly not classical.I shall be returning these.,2,0,904
A3TM3ZHUK9A1GK,23,As with some other items I just received. I have not had this for very long but it has worked just fine so far. Item just as described.  Would buy from this seller again.  I also received it very quickly.,5,1,204
A3TMC3Q6IKL397,0,I bought this mouse for my mother.  She is 80 years old and it was almost impossible for her to manage a mouse.  She could not hold the mouse still while clicking.This track ball provides a resting place for her hand so  she can move the ball. get her fingers off it and then click.  Setting up  one of the middle buttons for double clicking is also important.  Since she  has difficulty managing the double click sequence and double clicking with  one button is 100% reliable.Without this device she would random drag  the mouse while trying to click and double click and wind up doing very  strange and frustrating things.  This mouse isolates the movement of the  cursor from the clicking actions which is essential for her.Everyone  else who uses her system adapts very quickly.  It is not a problem for  mouse users.,4,1,821
A3TN040N8569P2,88,This product is amazing. I had a CD that was completely unplayable that I just fixed as well as a DVD that was completely unplayable.  To the people who have problems. READ THE DIRECTIONS FIRST. it will play. it wont look as new as you want. but it plays just fine.  To the person who wrote about residue. what residue? The SkipDr uses nothing but water. Ive never heard of water leaving residue.  Dont be stupid people. this product isnt made for the stupid.,5,1,459
A3TNF8XL9ER1DF,44,I ordered this last week to replace my old cable. which I had lost. When I got the cable today I immediately tried to hook it up. but it wont fit anywhere on my phone. its not the same as the original cable I received with my phone about a year ago. SO I dont know if there is a newer version of this phone out that it is compatible or with or not. but if you if are looking to buy this cable. make sure to look at the picture and your phone first and dont make my mistake.On a positive side. the item was here in only a few days in good condition and is reasonably priced.,2,0,573
A3TNMCEWZI038N,0,Having owned both the Altec Lansing 48s and these I feel I am knowledgeable to speak about thses speakers.  I blew out the Altecs.easy to do since they have a digital volume adjustment with no readout so if your computer restarts you have no idea what they are set at until you play them..  The Altecs were good speakers BUT THE YAMAHASLIKE MANNA FROM HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The bass is deep.tight and rich and the satelites are so clear that I am hearing stuff now on songs that I never heard with the Altecs.  These Yamahas are a masterful feat of engineeringBUY THEM!!!!!!!!!!!,5,1,577
A3TOAMX04VLZKZ,45,Originally I bought this backpack for myself.  Im forever searching for the roomiest. most comfortable. and safest backpack.  Since I do not have a laptop. but my husband does. he has now taken it over and plans to travel  with it.  We both find it extremely functional and easy to wear.  My  colleague has modeled this pack at work and also finds it appealing.  I  also embrace being an advertisement for amazon.com.,4,1,417
A3TOASQGF58Z8S,35,I bought this player about 3 months ago. and have had great luck with it. I have a Zenith 27u0026quot TV. so the speakers arent all that great. This great machine EMULATES MUCH better sound over my existing tv speakers. I  was VERY impressed. The picture was great too. no complaints at all. It  also shipped relatively fast.,5,1,325
A3TPM2VJA0X1Y2,22,This case is the perfect size for the D460 and accessories .case is approx 7u0026quot tall X 3.5u0026quot wide X 3u0026quot deep.. The main pouch is well padded and made of soft material. The bottom is reinforced to resist wear. Inside the front zippered pocket. there is a mesh pocket for memory cards. as well as an divided elastic band meant for 4 AA batteries. Inside the flap of the front pocket there is a zippered mesh pouch. which runs the entire legnth of the flap .approx. 6u0026quotx3u0026quot.. for extra accessories.The only thing I dislike is the velcro on the main flap is a bit weak. and seems to come open without much force. I would have rather seen a zipper to keep the main pouch closed.Other than that. this is a fantastic case. and I recommend it.,4,1,769
A3TQTHF9OKW9L7,55,The  newer model c2020 has all the fixes except the lens cap tether.  It comes with charger and NiMH batteries.  They even moved the power on switch and changed the menu controls.  I thought the software to be very good for  most peoples use. A USB memory card reader is still a must have.,4,1,289
A3TR171J5STZED,1315,One of the reviewer above said that his experience when using the unit with the modem is bad.  His modem speed is 56000 but when operated with the RCA extension unit it runs at 9600 speed.  Of course. the manual of this product shown here in Amazon explicitly said that it will provide best result with modem at 9600.  It is not the products fault.READ THE MANUAL BEFORE  YOU BUY!,4,1,380
A3TR5KZYRTWIK5,1516,Purchased this radio a month ago and it has exceeded all my expectations.Very easy to recharge batteries right in the lower portion of the radio. Also the accessory plug adapter is great for use in the car or on the motorcycle.,5,1,227
A3TS0RU5T6XH4P,22,I recieved the VCR on Friday 892013 and someone hooked it up for me. the picture is all whoobbley and sometimes stacticly. I did not recieve the remote so it is hard to do the tracking on it right now I am a little upset about the VCR. Hopefully in the next couple of days I can get it to work. if not I will have to send it back and get a refund or an exchange cause I am really not happy about the product. We shall see.,2,0,422
A3TTE8TBQ032HR,0,Its label tape. but I needed a refill so I added it to an order of stuff I needed so I wouldnt have to go to an office supply store.,4,1,132
A3TUEUHI0BANUA,0,It is very simple to use.  But it doesnt seem to work.  For example. the playback of a movie that I video tape may be very bad from the visual standpoint. although the audio is OK.  There will appear on the screen a notice that my video head may need cleaning.  I remove the tape that was visibly defective and insert the dry video head cleaner and follow the simple instructions.  When the cleaning cycle is completed. I then remove the video head cleaner and reinsert the tape that was visibly bad.  There is little. if any. improvement.  Shortly thereafter. I insert a new tape that I recorded on.  The notice again appears on the screen that my video head needs cleaning. even though I cleaned them the same day or one or two days earlier.  If it worked. it would have been a good product.  No liquid to insert. reasonably priced. and easy to use.  But it did not work.,1,0,873
A3TUYBYRJEEGA5,33,It protects my nook..  The clips that hold the nook in seem a little loose in comparison with my old gray with silver words Bu0026N nook case.  I like the feel of it.  I dont like that I cant fold back the front cover some to make it smaller when holding it.  The leather is stiff.  Im not sure the magnetic latch will stay on forever.,4,1,335
A3TXIBKJBNPKX4,0,I love my NOOK..I am so glad I got the black and white and not color because my ipod does all the internet stuff and my nook feels like I am simply reading a book. I definetly recommed it to everyone.,5,1,200
A3TZ53BGX202OO,33,I got this cd player because it has all the things on it and its easy to use and program and the color is ice blue and thats cool and the sound is wide open and clear no skipping at all and I dont use batteres that often I love the wall adapter its all i nead,5,1,259
A3TZ8BI2UUXRMP,25,The product wouldnt fit my nuvi product. I had a nuvi2595 LMT model . According to a website I visited the 2460 LMT  was supposed to fit most all nuvi models including the 2595 model .I called the seller and they informed me I needed a different charger and asked me to send it back . Which I did and they credited me a refund. The sellers were very helpful in telling me which model would fit and refunded my purchase price.,4,1,425
A3TZI7G52WTQGD,11,Ive been using for 2 weeks now for work communications. with only one problem. The coiled cord is so stiff it pull the mike off wherever I clip it. Either make cord 46 inches longer. or she more flexible cord.,4,1,209
A3TZPKTJUYMERH,0,Bought this for downloading map updates to my Garmin Nuvi.  Excellent value.  It wont work with my Mac Mini. but is quite simple to use in a PC with a card slot.,5,0,161
A3TZS6FAG01FSE,0,This tape makes great labels. The blackonyellow matches all the Dewalt tools in my workshop. My only complaint is that. at least for the width of tape I purchased.  the backing is difficult to remove.,4,1,200
A3U0O5JF0YRZSN,0,I got the E105 and have used it for a few months now.  The MP3 player is OK. but after playing 5 or 6 songs. it hogs memory and starts cracking.  The only way to remedy is to soft reset the machine.  Using the MP3 player  slowly drains the memory until it performs painfully slow. The sync cradle  does not work properly and disconnects from the computer at random  intervals.  The screen is all scratched from using the stylus .weak.. The  more programs loaded onto the 32 megs of internal memory. the slower it  gets.  Loading even 1 MP3 file on the 32 megs of internal memory makes it  painfully slow.  What is the point of having so much memory if you cant  use it?  CE could use a new version too.  There is no option to close  programs.  You have to either reset the machine or go to START. SETTINGS.  SYSTEM. TASK MANAGER. END TASK to close programs.  Whats up with that? The  intent for a good product is there. but dont beleive the hype. this  product is not ready for the masses.,2,0,989
A3U0VZB1PQX5M4,66,Flawed drivers  not compatible with Windows98.2d Ed..  I have had experiences similar to the Reviewer. u0026quotAn electronics fan from Chicago.u0026quot I wish I read that review. first! If the device is left  plugged into the USB port. Windows98.2d Ed. wets the bed at bootup. The  Tech support is a long distance call. weekdays during normal business  hours.  The support information is printed among the other hype on the box   throw away the manual. but dont forget to read the fine print on the  box!  I wasted many hours trying to get the USB to function properly before  I pulled the box from the trash and found ..... listed  as a website.  Then. I wasted another couple hours trying to get the newer  drivers to work. For the time being. Ive given up  Ill just have to  remember to unplug the thing when I put the computer to bed  or Ill find  Film Reader USB has left a blue puddle on my screen in the morning.,1,0,921
A3U3429ZHUHRNM,55,Anyone can unlock it with hollowed out bic pen in less than 30 seconds.Laptop owners buy a combination lock and not the standard circular locks used for laptop locks.,1,0,166
A3U3CO526W87PB,5174,Case was adorable but a little flimsy. I like more of a durable case. Great transaction though. Still have the case and use it from time to time.,4,1,145
A3U4AIFD3JJZSH,0,I recieved this product. read the box and had to return it. Thanks for making it so easy to replace for what I needed.,1,0,118
A3U4WSE52PLWRC,3,I ordered this product to give to my mother for mothers Day.  She got it on time.  Now As of June 13.2000 the modem is no longer working. It simply wont connect. There is some type of error and wont accept commands.,1,0,215
A3U5YY6V7DZB9I,23,This disk has tiny. tiny little brushes on it.  It didnt seem to do anything for my DVD player.,2,0,95
A3U6HVI3EWAZWU,47,Works good....like the motion. Its hard to put the tv on the mount. Other than that its exactly what its supposed to be,4,1,119
A3U6OYOI8UNIRI,1,Im 65. and a USN communications veteran. So I know whats good and whats bad.Forget all those cheap Chinese radios with digital tuners that have God knows what for input impedance. Forget Radio Shack and their combination short wave AMFM. This is the best AM radio ever made. It is as good as the old Hammarlund. Hallicrafters. and NCRs. They were tube radios. the tubes needed replacement. then the IFs needed realignment. This is transistor. It doesnt wear out.I dont have a scope or sig gen to make a signal to noise radio check. but I can tell this has a very sensitive RF amp. You string a 100 foot longwire to this radio. and youll be able to pull in half the country. Im paying 130year for XM to listen to Tankee ballgames. but I can cancel that out now.,5,1,760
A3U6VLSJO05UGD,45,You probobly wont like this review because its coming from an eleven year old.  This is a great product. exept for the bateries.  Now to an 11 year old. 200 buck is a heck of a lot of money. I know theres those super fancy  1000 doller cameras that are way out of my budget. . no i didnt get help  from my parents writing this review . I used to have a POS camera called a  JamC@m. Believe me. never buy it.  Anyway. this camera quite good. but i  thought a little to much i guess. cause the pictures were only 640 by 480  pixels. This was quite the disapointment. I still have fun making slide  show like movies with the TV port.  Oh.  and. if you have a mac. dont buy  this product.  If you are a profetianoa photographer. but dont have tons of  money. buy this camera.  The little screen on the back of the camera is a  little slow though. like if you move the camera fast. the screen will blur.  thats all I can think of right now so. i hope this was helpfull.,4,1,964
A3U6W3M2UDRK1N,2325,This is acually a good player when you first purchase it. You really notice the sound quality and the different features such as u0026quotgrooveu0026quot and u0026quotmega bassu0026quot functions. The water resistant  body is also good for pool side listening. The head phones that are  included are not very good ones and are easy to break. They also feel very  weak when you wear them. The antishock memory could have more capacity but  with the locking hood. it helps. This is a great CD player until it begins  to age. After a year and two months. mine started to act up. You would have  to push play three or four times before it would start. The LCD screen  started to blink and go out at times. Eventually you have to put foil on  the button inside or else the CD player will not know the lid is closed.  Then my motor went out. This is a good player but for a short amount of  time.,3,0,890
A3U7I2H2SLL8C8,56,The product was what I expected and the price was the main reason I made the purchase.  I have never gotten a bad wird yet knock on wood.,4,1,137
A3U8JV6UJV2HJA,1,Perfectly awful.My twins got them for presents. One never worked the other has broken after two weeks. They also have a diabolical system of charging you for downloading. I gave my son my debit card number as a one time deal the nook sucked in the number and now its there permanently for him or anyone who finds it to just press once and charge my debit card! Its disgusting! Also. the online support is practically nonexistent theres actually a glitch they havent fixed in the Chat customer service that doesnt allow you to categorize your complaint in one area until youve categorized in another. Oh.and have I mentioned that the nook gift cards I purchased for each of them dont work?,1,0,688
A3U8L18K3JQ5AH,33,Was working fine until they added google to it. Constantly adding google+ and other apps you cant delete. System slowed down and started to get kicked off the web so it could synchronize my library with the new google updates. So google killed my fun and my nook. Traded it in getting a Kindle Fire HD instead. Nook sold out and it didnt get better for it.,1,0,356
A3U97QF29KHLJQ,26,this can very fast love it so far never had a colored onenow I will never go back to black and white,5,0,100
A3UBNP5DWQCNEH,22,I purchased this binocs for a tiger safari in India and am amazed by the quality of this product. Certainly recommended and a great value for price. AAAAAAA plus quality.,5,0,170
A3UC5VT6RMOR33,22,This unit has very poor audio in comparison to some higherend units and it is most likely due to the size and type of speaker used in the unit because when I used an external speakermike the audio was much better. As  for the the battery life...It is a weird thing. Midland had the right idea  to shut of the LED display while on a single channel. which definetly  improves battery life. but when the unit is scanning the display stays on.  As for the durability of the unit. it is fairly obvious that the battery  door on the back of the unit is a very poor design and comes open  accidently. In general. I would have to say that its worth spending a few  more dollars and buying something halfdecent.,2,0,702
A3UCQ3WHDZE2L8,3743,I purchased this item for use with a variety of video chatconferencing software applications.  No special drivers were required for my Mac .OS X 10.7.x. and the sound output quality is SUPERB.  FAR exceeds what I expected from such an affordable USB speakerphone.  No tinnyness or vibrations. rather clean highs and impressive midslows for such a small device.I havent tested it with any conferencing software. so Ill update my post once I use it as intended.,4,1,459
A3UDAWGZFMOL3R,45,I bought the Asus Transformer Book T100TA and wanted to buy the memory card for it. so I found this specs that seems like it was made specifically for Asus.  When I received the memory chip it had nothing on the package relating to the laptop.  I assume that in fact Scandisk came out with memory chip made for this product since it has been selling like hot cakes. So just be warn they are scandisk with the same specs that sells for less. its exactly the same but for less.,1,0,475
A3UE78V8Z8G1YP,11,the tape is good and works perfectly with my labeler.I used to label most of my familys things.It doesnt work very well with objects that need to wash with hot water or will go to microwave. the ink start to fade out.,3,0,217
A3UE9QQ7I0DEKK,0,This is a great product.  I am an attorney and I carry this around with me at Court.  Very professional looking and I really like the magnetic flap.,5,0,148
A3UFCX1AE4TKZE,22,Ive been using these for over a year now.  Basically. in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They arent as good as similarlypriced studioclass headsets. but youre paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent. and has acceptable detail in treble. vocal. and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well.  Ive taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices. which is nice in the office.However. I must have pretty big ears. and Ive found that the foam cups arent quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long. and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 18th inch stereo jack to the dual 18th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I dont like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDRNC11s might have been a better choice in that regard.Theyre also kind of bulky unless you have a large carryon to keep them in.  Im paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me. since the MDRNC20s come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I havent had any spills yet. but active travellers may wish to find a case thats more rigid.All in all. Im pretty happy with these.  The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldnt justify the USD300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups.,4,1,1809
A3UFJZ9NU190YH,1111,My HP touch pad was a gift from my son.  I love its convenience...including using it as an alarm clock.  I accidently tripped over the charging cord and misaligned the plug which prevented me from recharging the device.  Thankgoodness for this product which is completely compatible.  The only thing I didnt consider was the length of the cord.,4,1,344
A3UFXU650BHG2O,0,very good tapes never a problem the best frequency response chrome oxide getting a little pricey these days though excellent off vynile,4,1,135
A3UGS7H6GMM6Y4,0,The sound quality on this radio is fantastic. The only improvement that I would suggest is to convert the tuner to digital. Its sorta tough to fine tune distant stations with an analog dial.,4,1,190
A3UHU5EYXTEWH8,1,Absolutely useful reader and helpful device.totally recommend to buy. High speed. different modes to read and apps included.you can easily carry it with you.,5,0,157

A3UKB1QYS8KBW0,22,I am trying to get this to work for the last 2 weeks ... unfortunately without success. I bought the bundle 3 .Bluelogger u0026 Street Atlas 2005 u0026 Street Atlas 2005 Handheld.. The installation went fine. but I had problems in hooking up to bluetooth. I had to reset my HP iPAQ 2215 several times in this process and my IBM T30 .2.4 GHz and with 1GB RAM. was very slow ... not sure why this was.Once I got the laptop to work. I took the Blue Logger out for a trip and downloaded the trip when I returned. Well. I coudnt make sense out the data the Blue Logger logged  the waypoints were almost all over the map. This was not the route I took.I am still within the 30day riskfree guarantee and try to return it next week.,1,0,724
A3UL1A747PIV70,78,The Nook is nice. but I still like a real book. I dont have to worry about the battery dying with a real book. However. if you want to read War and Peace. its easier to carry a Nook with you than that phonebook of a novel.,3,0,222
A3UMGM3USYLL9B,14,I dont really recommend anyone buying this since the plastic stuff which makes contact with the touch screen is not as durable as I expected. If you roll the screen vastly with this pen. the plastic stuff can easily be ripped.,2,0,226
A3UMRFL0EYCQK6,0,Well they sold this as a new product. and it was not. The serial  on box didnt match serial  on machine. And u could see where there had been some work done. Little marks on top where screen was lifted. I was disappointed by that. Reconditioned should have been specified.,3,0,272
A3UNB8ASV0YNCN,11,The TV wall mount worked just fine for a 22 inch Vizio.  It was easy to mount.  Very happy with it.,4,0,99
A3UNL085ZNYV2W,0,I never could get this to work to my high standards. Receptions was very poor and short reach. Transmission about the same,1,0,122
A3UOX98XANA5BE,0,The cable arrived promptly and is working fine.  More expensive cables work no better than inexpensive cables. in my humble opinion.,4,1,132
A3UQ7RTEAEPUFX,0,I have had the Psion 5mx for about two months and have found it to be a very usefull machine. It is a wonderfull design and is full featured with very usable software.The case has a nice grey metalic finish. It really feels good in your hands. On the front side of the case you will find buttons which enable one touch voice recording. which is great for meetings. The volume is not that loud due to the small size of the speaker but it serves the purpose.On one end is a flash memory card slot. The machine comes with 16 mg. but this slot allows for upto 128 extra. which is more memory then most people could ever use. Great for storing EBook. Encyclopedias. etc. Also the stylus is stored here. It is three sided. stanless steal. with a plastic coating. It has a sturdy feel.On the other end is a cover for the Lithium backup battery and a softhard rest button. On the back of the case is the AA battery compartment. the speaker. and serial port connection.When opened the keyboard slides out to revel a black keyboard and a good sized screen. The keyboard really makes the difference. it has a good resonse. You know when you hit a key. It is hard to u0026quottouchtypeu0026quot but u0026quothunt and pecku0026quot works fine. Anyone who has bought a PALM. and then one of those foldable keyboards has bought the wrong machine.The screen is good. not great. After all it is 16 greyscale. not color. But there is an excellent backlit for dark conditions. However this does drain batteries. .I use rechargable and get about 7 hours of normal use. Sometimes there can be glare because of the reflective nature of the screen. but tilting the unit will alleviate this.On great feature is an enlargerreducer icon. This is like changing the % of a document you want to see. Great for spreadsheets and EBooks. There is also a cutcopypaste icon which is very handy.All of the major software applications have an icon on the bottom of the screen for quick access.  Word and Excel are easily converted tofrom your PC. The Psion versions have excellent features. All of the standard formating options are available. bold. underline. outline etc. The sheet has many mathmatical. financial and logical functions. There is also a nice graph feature. PIE. BAR. Line etc. in the sheet software.I have seen Excel on PALM devices but it is not the same. The screen is to small and if you want to WORK with a file you really need a keyboard!Adgenda and contact are standard. There is a regular and scientific calculator. There is a spellcheckerthesaurasisThere is a Jotter program. which allows quick entry of notes into what looks like 3 x 5 cards. Great for meeting notes.There is an excellent clock program as well an outstanding freeware program for world views of time.Also included is an u0026quotEtch a Sketchu0026quot program that allows free from writingdrawing and has many different brush featuresIncluded is a decent clipboard collection which can be copied into any document. This program is very usefull for quick notes. or drawing maps. flow charts. etc....There are other features such as internet connections. database. infra red printing and even programming on this that I have not even looked at.On the internet you amy easily download alot of freewareshareware games. software. etc.  I really like the EBooks on a Psion. the screen makes a BIG difference when reading.One last thing to remember. because of the keyboard and screen size. the Psion can seem a bit bulky when compared to a PALM device. However I carry it my back pocket or in a suit coat. If could easily fit inside a purse. If you travel alot you do not need to worry about docking stations. all you need is a couple of AAs.  All in all a very good computer.,4,1,3728
A3UQCHV318XC5K,1515,I just got this thing and although it looks nice and feels nice it has limited capacities.  Most importantly I cannot insert a microSD card with my own epubs into it and this is why they gave you more memory. They hide the fact you cannot expand it with the card and charge you more to get less capacity.  Ive never been more disappointed with an Amazon purchase and cannot understand why the Bu0026N website doesnt point this out and neither does the Amazon website.  Im returning mine ASAP and will order the  Simple  model with Glowlightthe  simple  one is more capable.  I am very disappointed in their marketing of this model .deliberately deceitful..  The reason I have liked the Bu0026N readers is their expandability and this trumps the Kindle features in my mind.,2,0,772
A3UQILJFVZMXFB,12,A terrific cd player!  Got this for my 7 year old son and he loves it.  It has plenty of features and with the car kit and adapter included. its a great value.  The sound is very good with the headphones but I really like it in my van. especially with the bass boosted!  I read a lot of negative comments about the headphones. but they seem fine to us.  Theyre not broken yet.  They do fit better backwards. at least on adults.  The antiskip works really welleven on Cleveland .Ohio. streets which are always in need of repair.

A3UUK286EGZKEA,12,Made at a time when the inclusion of songs was all but compulsory for a family film. this musical adaptation nonetheless manages to translate the best aspects of Twains book to the screen.  The movie does an impressive job of creating a dramatic shape out of Twains material.  The book is a collection of episodes which form a composite portrait of Toms character. and. for adult readers. offer a glimpse into a lost world but there really is no narrative drive.  The murder and Toms subsequent dilemma about testifying in court are simply two episodes unconnected to the other events.  In the book. the boys simply decide one day to form a gang of robbers and go live on the island.  In the movie. the retreat to the island arises out of the boys fear after having witnessed the murder. and it is only the guilt they feel while spying on their own funeral that makes them return home.  The songs are not especially memorable. but harmless enough.  The performances by the supporting adult cast are strong. particularly that of Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly.  A splendid scene at the dinner table is a masterful fleshingout of Twains prose.  Full of nice photography and beautiful scenery. this movie sparkles with joy and youthful optimism.,4,1,1238

A3UZ17HANZ9F1E,55,When I hear PDA. I would like to now envision a device that may look roughly like the Palm V. but has a lot more packed in it. Palm V is an excellent device and it is a great buy for the sake of the technologys first step.But. after using it for about a year now. I am being selfish. I want more memory. I want color. I want sound and I want a floating connection to the rest of the world. So. my advice  when you buy a PDA. go for something with at least color and more memory .for the sake of technologys next step.. You are going to run out of the Palm Vs 2MB if you are like me and like to download all those available applications. Palm Vx has 8MB memory which should be enough for the time being. but I want more .Sorry !..I am looking at the PDA to be the materialisation of Isaac Asimovs vision of a hand held device which is carried by everyone in the world and has a unique identification number. So if you want to talk to your sister. just punch in her id number and there she is on the screen looking at you and yelling at you for buzzing her when she was in the shower !! Our privacy is going to be under fire. but it is going to be fun all the same. Asimov said that by 2010. this will be a reality. And. the world is fast getting there. Palm V is only an initial step !! My advice  go for the next step.,4,1,1318
A3UZRSWR92PB68,2227,Having thought long and hard over my purchase and physically used many models and makes of GPS it is hard to say which is best as they all seem to  have positive and negative aspects.Ill compare the Magellan 315320  to a Garmin 1212XL as this is its most likely competition. .The Garmin  12XL is significantly more expensive..The Magellan has a far better  screen .more pixels therefore finer detail and varying levels of greyblack  for graphics. and offers customisable displays not seen in the Garmin.you  can choose what data you want to see and what screens you want made  available from a choice of nine.. A GPS compass only works when you are  moving so that if you stop and turn around it will no longer point  correctly. The Magellan compass screen shows where the sunmoon should be  on the horizon so that you can orientate yourself this proves extremely  useful and is not available on the Garmin. However on the map screen the  Magellan does not allow you to change zoom levels as well as pan over other  areas of the map. meaning that you cannot zoom in to look in detail  anywhere other than your present location  making the screen far less  useful .Garmin can pan and zoom..Both units can display all the same  data .e.g. Heading. Bearing. Speed. LatLong. Time to Go. etc..and store  more waypoints and routes than most people would use. The Magellans and  Garmin 12XL also have a directory of updateable cities .31512XL. and  nautical navigation points .320.. .Anyone considering the Garmin Etrex  should note that it does not have a number of useful features seen on these  models and has an irritating screen that only shows one item of data at a  time so requires constant button pressing..Satellite lock on times  and performance are the same with the Garmin being very slightly quicker  but both as accurate and constant as each other. Only the Garmin 12XL has  an external antenna port .especially useful for vehicles although all will  work well enough if positioned under the windshield.. Special reamplifying  antennas work with all models. The quoted figures for battery times are  Magellans 15 hours .using 2x AA batteries. and the Garmin 12. 24 hours  .using 4x AA batteries.. The Magellan is lighter to carry.  Both  makes are easy to use once you are familiar with them although the  Magellans manual seems to have been written by someone who was not!Final test. hold it in your hand examine it. press all the buttons  the  Magellan does not seem to have quite as good build quality as the  Garmin.In summary the two makes are very similar in performance but  the Magellan does offer more useful features and a nicer display for your  money with two batteries instead of four. The Garmin offers better  reliability and build quality....... But surely the  Magellan will be fine! So I bought the Magellan 315 and broke it within  three days by getting it wet!As I wait for a replacement unit from  Magellan I think I am correct in saying none of the GPS available are as  good as they could be. What I really need is Magellan features on a Garmin!,4,1,3076

A3V0PEIMOBU8H5,44,After ordering and returning the Coby brand version. which did not work at all. I am pleased to report this one works fine.  I bought it to play tunes from my Sandisk mp3 player on my car cassette deck. and this unit fits the bill nicely!,5,1,238

A3V1LX1CDLMGKR,0,I just recieved this DVD player and I LOVE IT!  I bought this player for the 6 disc changer and HDCD feature.  I also own the 2109 model and was please with that one but the movie collection has grown and I got tired of  getting off the couch to change movies.  The carousel is very quiet. the  picture is excellent. and the additional operating features are great.  Now  for my take on this random play controversy.  DVD players are first and  foremost a DVD player that happens to play audio CDs.  DVD movies load up  into the player while audio CDs do not.  Once a DVD movie is loaded it must  play that awful WARNING screen first and any other thing the maker of the  DVD wishes you to see.  So with that said. every time the disc would change  on random mode while its playing DVDs you would first have to see the  dreaded WARNING screens. which basically ruins the random play feature.  Now maybe one day in the future they will have a different random play mode  for DVDs and CDs. but thats not the case now.  So I hope that kinda solves  the random play mystery for some of you. others will just never understand  it. .Maybe they should buy a dedicated multiple CD disc changer.Oh yeah  this changer also plays CDVideo disc. but dont think you can transfer your  movies from VHS to CDVideo and play it on this player since it doesnt  play CDR disc.Ok. Im done.,5,1,1368
A3V1RXBLW8H7RZ,3234,This is my first digital camera. which I have shoot over 3.600 pictures for the past 21 months.  The pictures are overwhelming if the settings are correct. If you depend on the Auto Mode you will end up with many shots that are sub par.  You may need to adjust the lighting to accomodate for indoor and dusk pictures. The shortcomings are the bulking feel when holding the camera for several shots. that is why I prefer the tripod for a steady shot. The optical zoom is pretty good. and the digital zoom is worthless .I hear the same holds for other brands too..,4,1,562

A3V8Q2V0C0LR1T,0,I dont have much to add that hasnt been stated in the other reviews.Its thick. sturdy. and the addition of a writing pad addresses what I think is one of the worst drawbacks of the ipad.However. it doesnt have any ability to work as a stand which is somewhat annoying and the case .the border thing that actually holds the ipad in place. actually blocks the light sensor on my ipad so I have to flip that part of the case up to get it to detect the light in the room.,4,1,467
A3V8S5VKPG1B79,0,I just recently received the Rio 500 for a Fathers Day gift. I wanted one to paly audible files so I was pleasently suprised to receive it. Unfortunately Im returning it because the device doesnt live up to its billing.The main problems. 1. Low volume. Even maxd out the unit  doesnt have enough volume to drown out any background noise when listening  to the unit in a loud environment. ie. coffee house2. Poor documentation  and software. Theres little documentation with the unit to describe the  functions of the scroll wheel etc. youre on your own to figure it  out.3. Headphones the very first day I lost one of the foam caps and  had to have it replaced. only to have it fall off again a number of  times.I called Tech support about the volume problems and they just  responded that the Rio 600 has better volume. It was obvious that they were  unable to talk honestly about the 500 since it is a product that is being  phased out.Having said all of this I did purchase the Rio 600 and I give  it two thumbs up. The volume rocks and it has more functionality to the  controls and the layout. Since the 600 cost over USD100. and has only 32MB of  internal memory its more expensive but in the long run I think youll be  happier.,2,0,1234
A3V9DR2PGR9MIM,0,This camera is the best! I have absolutely no experience but it was so easy to figure it out! I especially like the option of saving or deleting photos on the actual camera. in case someone blinks or something. The auto flash is also awesome because I never know whether or not I need it. Its also so easy to put on my computer. and I can email my pics to friends as attachments in a jiffy. I strongly suggest this camera for great pictures and a good time!,5,1,457
A3V9X7HHL3MURJ,33,Bought this product to take to the UK and Ireland. Worked great!  All three of us ended up using it at some point during the 3 week trip as the others were having problems with their adapters...this one gave us no problems and it was great that it was compact and you could charge 2 devices at once.  I also like the lights to say it was charging and knew when they were charged the lights went off. cant wait to use it through out Europe next summer!,4,1,451
A3VBGRQ863LA5L,0,The product itself is very nice and easy to use. I use it for skiing and find it very convinient except VOX.

A3VC7DFTNM2FKK,1,This product . e reader is a great idea especially for seniors. Family who buy this as a gift for seniors with limited skills will have to be sure they teach them the basics. Even this review request for me is difficult to understand. My computer skills as so many of my age group. 80 yrs old are basic and new products take time to learn. I have not at this point learned or mastered the skill needed to use e readers to their fullest capacity. Barnes and Noble offers classes for e readers but only in the evening. I stop night driving a year ago. Im sure once I learn concepts involving the e reader it will provide me with many hours of enjoyment. Thank you.,4,1,662

A3VEJGA8LMWAOX,0,I absolutely love my Nook HD+.  I bought two for myself because it was such a great deal.  I purchased them through the Barnes u0026 Noble website for USD170 and never regretted my choice.  My husband now has one. as does my my sister.  I use it mainly for browsing the web. but also for reading books I have purchased or borrowed on Overdrive.  My two kids .3 u0026 5. got the 7inch Nook HD and it comes in handy for our rare restaurant visits. to keep them quiet and occupied.  The microsd storage option is wonderful.  It would be great if other tablets offered that. but I guess they want you to use their cloud for backup.  This is simply a great deal for the money.,5,1,671
A3VFCVUAFUCUJU,23,I ordered a nook from Amazon in Sept 2012. It stopped working properly within 2 monthswould not hold a charge. It started out holding a charge for several days. then reduced the time to about two days. So. I began trying to get a replacement. Amazon took no responsibilitysent me to Barnes and Noble for satisfaction. So....Amazon is NOT the place to order a NOOK. Thats my first warning for anyone wanting this ereader!Dealing with Bu0026N. First they claimed I had actually purchased the NOOK more than a year ago and thus the warranty had expired. It took a lot of phone time to prove their records were wrong. .I think perhaps they sent me a used NOOK that someone else had purchased and returned.. After much phone time. they saw that I had a record of purchase for just this year. Then I began going through their lengthy bureaucratic process to get a replacement. At the end. they demanded that I pay for the replacement. with my money to be refunded when my old one is sent back. I said nono way was I going to trust Bu0026N with more of my money. So they said I could do this exchange at a store. Unfortunately. the closest store has closed. and another is 70 plus miles away. but I dont have much choice. I said OK. Id do this exchange at that store. but probably it would take me a couple of months before I traveled to that area. No problem. they said. Thatll be fine. Then they sent me an email that said. Do this right away. the replacement will be good for only a limited time!Meanwhile. I have a largely useless device for which I paid almost USD100. Will I ever get a working device? Well. for over 3 months. I have not and Im not optimistic. I guess I will just toss it and get a Kindleexcept that I dont much trust Amazon to stand behind that product either!Dont get a Nook dont expect help from Amazon if you do.,1,0,1832

A3VIEY97D9UM8I,0,This system is at best adequate for Home Theatre in a smaller room.

A3VONQL7YW8UPM,44,We just purchased the Meade 90 ETX telescope and decided to get the computer controller too  and man are we glad that we did.  Were novices with the telescope. so finding specific objects in the night sky is a challenge.With the autostart. after taking about 15 minutes to go through the alignment process. we can just tell the Autostar what we want to find and it moves the telescope to the object for us.  Without this. the only thing we would probably look at in the sky is the moon.NOTE. If youre not planning to use your telescope to look at objects in the night sky .i.e. planets. etc.. then you dont need the Autostar.,5,1,625
A3VONQL7YW8UPM,1414,I read all the reviews before buying ... and was a little worried that it might not meet expectations.  But it has worked out great.It was a thrill to see Saturns rings and view Jupiter.  The moon comes through bright and clear.  You can see other heavenly objects .even galaxies!. with it.  You wont see galaxies and nebula in the same detail as you do in books  but youll see the dim shading of them in parts of the sky.Its compact and portable  so you can bring it to the beach. etc.  Our neighborhood is way to bright to use it for much nightsky viewing  so portability was a must.A scope that gave a better view. at the same price. would have been too big.  And a better portable would have cost too much.  This one was just right for us.  If price is not a problem. get a better portable scope.  If size is not a constraint. then spend less on a larger scope.  Otherwise. this one will do fine.MUST HAVE ADD ONS. A tripod .see my review there..  The computer controller .youll NEVER find a lot of the night sky objects without one..  One or two good night sky books .to help you find cool objects like binary stars and galaxies..COMPLAINTS. It would be nice for this .and all scopes. to see some pictures of how nightsky objects will really look with it before buying.,4,1,1274

A3VU1J666BU5JV,0,For professional typists. a natural keyboard is vital. Its key point is the possibility for hands to rest on the keyboard in their natural position. without need to curve ones wrists. One can then let his hands  constantly in a ready position to type in a command. effortlessly. From  this point of view. the size of the keys or their relative positions  doesnt really matter. One eventually get used to it. and if you ask me. I  like the feeling of this keyboard more than any other that I know. With it.  my speed reach 122 words per minute. Any other keyboard reminds me  constantly of its existence. This one is almost part of me.Using it for  UNIX doesnt spoil its capabilities. For instance. one of the windowkeys I  use as a shortcut for Mx under Emacs. and the Ctrl key position is so well  fitting the hands side that one has just to gently bend it to push the  key. without any strain on fingers. Ctrla or Ctrle which require the same  hand then go as one key. And what a more important key than the Ctrl one  for UNIX people?,5,1,1036
A3VU8ZBADJOZU,23,I bought these headphones a while back from a store called Factory Direct. They were refurbished. and I got them for only 20 CND dollars!

A3VUF7MR1JR5J4,33,The GoodI must say I love this DVD player.  The first one I have owned and it playes great.  I use the AV jacks into a 28 inch Phillips Mag TV and it looks like a movie screen.  Im so spoilled that I dont even  rent VHS tapes anymore.  I had one problem with a rented DVD .Wag the Dog..  But once I cleaned the disk like the manual says it played perfectly.  The  stero sound is great too.  A quick tip though.If you dont have a  receiver and just use your TV for sound. in the system setup choose PCM  sound and high compression for the best sound.  No compression makes you  have to turn the TV up real high in order to hear clearly.Make sure  the sound on your DVD player matches the one on your DVD when watching  movies.  I bought The Best Man for my lady and the player was set for Dolby  while the disk was sending DTS.  Result. no sound and 5 minutes of PANIC.  Just match them up again and all is fine.The BadNot being able to  burn your own Audio CDs is a bit of a moan.  But once you  play the Matrix  for the first time you get over it.  I am mad that I cant play burned  Video CDs. Wanted to archive my collection of KungFu movies and tapped  Saturday morning Cartoons.  But in a year I should be able to upgrade my pc  and get a second DVD player for the bedroom so I could do that then.The UglyAll the reports I have heard about the DVD player had made  me kinda scared about my future with the RC5220P.  The review seem to be  about 65% to 35% in favor.  I am almost past the 2 month mark so I will do  a follow up if anything happens.  But so far I am on happy camper.,4,1,1585
A3VUQ3Q3Q80VP0,4243,One small feature I havent seen mentioned the keyboard has an extendable foot you can use to keep it from tipping over on nonflat surfaces.  I found this keyboard very nice during finals the notes I took during the  semester quickly becam a searchable database.  Graffiti simply cant match  the speed of a true keyboard.,4,1,320
A3VWERLK6ZOWP,0,Brought the refurbished nook for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it.  We recieved the nook in its original box with all its accessories.  The delievery was timely. We were able to download books and use it right away. Ours has the 3G feature in it. For the price we paid it is very well worth it. No problems so far.,4,1,322
A3VX3P0SZ9QU7T,0,This product is junk.  I bought it because I didnt want to play Resident Evil 2 with the keyboard... but I ended up playing it with the keyboard anyway and doing much better than the pad.  The problem is this. the  calibration program is junk.  You set a null input and yet your character  will spin around as if heshe is doing the Chubby Checker Twist.,1,0,353
A3VX64FYFCYBRA,88,The RCA926 wireless phone jack and the extentions are not what they advertise.  They will work as a phone jack and with satellite.  but when used with caller ID and your satellite recever it will not display the caller ID .if you subscibe to it from your phone company. on your TV.  No where on the online discription of the product does it state this. Only in the instuction manual that came with it.You will be better off purchasing the wireless jacks from Dish Network which are cheaper and will make full use of the features such as the caller ID being displayed on your TV.If I had know I would not of throw out the boxs for the wireless phone jack and the additional extention I had purchased. I would of returned it for a refund. I do not recomment this product if you plan on using it with a satilite receviever.,1,0,820
A3VXW2QUU8G1AL,23,The original reason I purchased this device was to use it for my textbooks. But to my displeasure. Barnes u0026 Noble doesnt allow for any of their tablets to read text books from NOOKStudy .their ebook reading program.. It has been a rather irritating discovery because they hide that fact in the fine print.I feel that anyone who is thinking of purchasing this product should know this fact up front. If the user does not intend to use it for that reason. great. But if you do. be warned. This will be a waste of your money.Other than that. it is fine. It runs like an android for internet. My wife and I use it mainly for quick searches and to watch videos. But being run on android programming means it can be slow and cumbersome at times. And you cannot download anything without it being through Nook.If you so choose to buy this product. I recommend a stylus pen to prevent the screen from building an oily film.,2,0,919

A3VY72S8J2P4Q4,0,I have been through bunches of wireless headphones.  There are three transmitters stationed around the house now.This one works much better than any of them. with solid clean signal all around the house.But once you put those batteries in. theyre in for life.  You can get them out with several minutes aggressive effort with tools. but youll get tired of doing this.  Maybe somebody should have designed this thing competently in the first place.The headphones themselves are the small cushioned type that just clumsily sit on your year.  Not painful but you couldnt call them comfortable.,1,0,590
A3VZ0EAKYY8KP,22,I recently purchased the nook thinking it would be great for school.  Most of my readings for class are pdfs that the professors post online.  Reading on the computer screen hurts my eyes and it seems wasteful to print out all the pages.  This seemed like the perfect solution.  However. the result was teeny tiny print on the screen that I was unable to enlarge because it wasnt the Barnes and Noble ebook format.  In addition. the capacity of the device is grossly overestimated.  I have no idea how it is supposed to fit so many books if it couldnt even store 500 pages of pdf document for me.  Definitely something to skip purchasing.  Save your money.,1,0,656
A3W112102BC6BG,410,I bought these babies the same day that i bought my Vx. I thought that it would have been a good investment counsidering how small the styli are. Considering my penchant for misplacing things. particularly pens. i thought i should go ahead and get them. For some strange reason. Ive only lost one in 6 months and that was the one that came with the unit. In that aspect one pack of these replacement stylus should last you a while.However if you can get other replacement styli that can fit the silo i suggest you go that way. The replacement styli dont seem to fit the silo as well as the original one. It doesnt fit right. After a little investigation i found that the plastic tip .the part that can unscrew. is slightly larger in circumference then the original stylus. Thats why it seems a little tight when you take the it out and put it back. Why this is. i have no clue but its really annoying.For anything else you can get these babies to preserve the continuity of the unit. otherwise i recommend you find another replacement stylus that can fit the silo.Personally though i dont use the stylus. I recommend you go get one of those multipens that have a stylus. pen and pencil all in one. All serious Palm users use one of these instruments simply because any type of prolong use of the stock stylus will certainly give you cramps. at the very least. Its like writing with a toothpick. If you anticipate that your going to be scribling on your palm a lot go get a multipen. Cross makes a good one. Lamy and Rotring also makes excellent multipens. Personally i use a Rotring black matte Triopen. It carries a blue pen. stylus and pencil. Its a great size. weight and looks incredibly cool.Again if you anticipate scribling alot on your palm. i strongly recommend getting a multipen. However if you dont think you will be the stock stylus will suffice.,3,0,1859
A3W112102BC6BG,1313,What a lot of people dont realize when it comes to using computers the most abused piece of equipment would be the mouse. Particularly u0026quotInternetu0026quot PCs and Gaming PCs. The entire computer experience is usually distroyed with a substandard mouse. It is critical that you find a good quality mouse. Afterall it is the primary input device for your pc.You normally dont associate Microsoft with hardware and many of their hardware products barely make the u0026quotsatisfactoryu0026quot level. their mice however are exceptions.You wont be disappointed with this mouse. Its definately not a highend mouse but this is how mice should be made at the very least.Another aspect of the mouse that is often overlooked is the mousepad. A good quality mousepad also contributed greatly to the whole experience. I recommend the 3M mousepad. I promise you once youve tried it you wont want to use anything else. It also keeps your mice clean.Good product. good value,4,1,967
A3W1HR9KXP0Q9J,0,The microphone is great and has decent noise cancelling. but no mute switch as advertised.I bought this with the intention of creating a boom mic for a pair of headphones. and for that. theyre great. I will miss the mute functionality. but I cant really complain considering they knocked the price back down to something reasonable .USD9.99. instead of 50 bucks. Decent mic for the price. amazing mic if youre looking to velcro it to headphones.,4,1,445

A3W44XJDJI0TMU,0,After going through my first 4pack of alkaline batteries in my digital camera in only 1 day. I immediately looked into rechargables.I hadnt purchased any rechargables in a while. back when only NICADs were the only option.  I was often a victim of the memory effect. which NIMH completely eliminates.My camera has both an LCD display and a viewfinder. and the batteries will usually last about 2 or 3 days of picture taking unless I use the LCD monitor. which will reduce the longevity to about a day and a half.If you transfer your pictures directly from your camera instead of a card reader. your battery power will suffer a great deal.Overall. Im satisfied with these batteries. but with todays higherdrain cameras. Im sure there are other batteries that will hold a stronger and longer charge.,4,1,797
A3W44XJDJI0TMU,88,I purchased this charger along with a few AA NIMH batteries for my digital camera.While Ive never timed how long it takes to recharge the batteries. I usually plug it in overnight and does a pretty good job.Even though I dont own any NiCd batteries. the charger is able to recharge those also. as well as 9V rechargables.My only complaint is that Im often u0026quotclosingu0026quot the bottom terminals to keep a tight grip on the batteries.  Theyve never fallen off while recharging. but when you insert them. you get the feeling that they may fall off.,4,1,554
A3W4V3QSUXK138,23,I write under very special conditions. I was using a palm with a keyboard. but I found it not to be powerful enough. A laptop was too heavy. the battery life was miserable. and it took forever to turn on. I found a jornada on Ebay. It is a piece of junk! They get constant memory losses. and it took a week for the screen to fall right off its hinges. I got another and it was wiped with the most crucial information of my life. Like you I read negative revues and gave it the benefit of the doubt.after all I love all electronics.. but heed my warning STAND CLEAR.,1,0,565
A3WJ78MM8UM1Y,715,I bought the 3pack of these tapes and they are terrible.  Only one of the 3 took a second recording with quality.  I have TDK tapes purchased more than 15 years ago. used at least once a month. and they are still good.  These old tapes are used on the same VCRs as the Maxell. so not an equipment problem causing the Maxell tapes to fail.Today Im going to buy the Sony 3pack.  Much more expensive but if they last better than the Maxell. then well worth it.,1,0,457
A3WRK30AW1EY,0,Only a few days after I bought it. one side of the headphone broke down. No sound would come out of it. and when it does. the sound would crackle every now and then that I just had to take it off.Its happened to me twice with this product.  At first. I thought it was just sheer luck that I got the defective product. Unfortunately. I couldnt return it because it was already opened. But when I purchased another one. it happened again.Dont buy these. Theyre low quality and will break down easily. Save your money and buy a better quality headphone.,1,0,550
A3X3IMU43NG53,0,When I used this product. I worried that the piece being superglued could come off. but when my monitor was stolen the thief attemted to rip the piece off the desk. the piece held on the desk and the plastic piece broke allowing the wire free. Now I am looking for one that is metal.,1,0,283
A3X4HP16UB4IF,1617,I absolutely LOVE my Nook Tablet!! I got it for Xmas. and it has been amazing. It completely solved my issue of wanting both an iPad and an ereader... it does both! Some people on here complained about apps. but I dont really care about apps so I havnt experienced anything like that with mine. Purchasing a book is really easy. and when you read you can set the styles yourself such as page color. font and font size. etc. And navigating the internet is super fast too. and I prefer it to using my iPhone for internet. I also love the Pandora radio feature it doesnt even play ads which is awesome! So all in all. I am one happy camper. ..,5,1,640
A3XLL2MERH9OK,22,How a company as well established as SONY. can make such a piece of crap. and then act like dont even recognize it when it breaks. is beyond me. Its a typical case of a brand name being so well known. they can make garbage. slap their name on it. and it still sells. Well. Ill never buy another thing with their name on it. Oh yeah. sorry to vent. but I got the nodisk error too. Sony said they were not aware of any such problem. Yeah. sure.,1,0,442
A3XNTYRDE0MFI,44,I recommend this monitor for anyone that cant decide what to get because of its wellrounded features.  Personally. I am more concerned about image  quality than size.  When I looked at the slew of monitors that were offered  at the store. this one seemed to have the clearest looking images.  Its  also not too big or too small. so its a decent u0026quotfirst monitoru0026quot  as well.  I work at an engineering firm. and we have used Viewsonic  monitors religiously with little or no problems.  The USB hub is extremely  useful if you have the right drivers for it.  It eliminates some of the  wire cluttering in the back of the pc. plus you dont have to reach back  there as much anymore.  The onscreen menu is easier to use than most TV  menus.  This product has been running over a year for now me with no  problems.  Hope that says something.,5,1,848
A3YAPBN7SS89,1717,I bought this power strip to plug in my tv. receiver and cable so I can completely power them off when Im done watching tv.  But the power switch is a poorly designed button switch which takes several pushes before it will click in so my equipment is powering on and off with every push.  Its very annoying and I wish I would have bought one with a toggle switch instead.Updated. After a while. the button does work properly.,3,0,425
A3YT985IUC44Y,912,Common problem.Amp fails.  Sub will start making a machine gun sound without even having audio signal driving it.C6 capacitor fails.  Straight from the BU120 service manual from Infinitys website.  Theres an appended memo that indicates this is a common problem and to replace the capacitor with an upgraded capacitor .10 microfarad. 100 volt. nonpolar electrolytic..Ive had both of these problems.  The C6 capacitor basically just got up and disappeared.  There was virtually nothing left of it after it blew.The amp was replaced once already. but apparently failed again.I think the speaker itself is good quality. box is well constructed.  The circuitry is terrible.,1,0,669
A3YWSYEIZSYNJ,1818,I love these things. they fit wonderfully into my system and have great response. The bass is thick without being muddy and the mids and highs are crisp and clear. I got them on sale and have been more than impressed with the money I spent. It has been a joy to listen to them. everything sounds wonderful from Mos Def to Johnny Cash to Aerosmith and Van Cliburn. I just cant say enough about these. to bad I have relegated them to my bedroom for my listening pleasure and not letting everyone else enjoy them.,5,1,510
A40DG6B2VJXX6,12,I received this item and it is defective. It keeps deleting all of my books. photos and resetting itself to factory settings.

A4116CA7C7MWY,22,I was very excited when I got my Zenith DVD2200 in the mail. Icouldnt wait to hook it up and watch some great movies. My first fewmovies on the machine worked great. but I could not get Ghostbusters to work at all! The player would give me a disc error every time I put it in. Finally. I called Zenith and asked what the problem was. They said it need a software upgrade and to send it in. I did. and got it back about 2 weeks later. This time no discs would work at all!  NONE of my DVDs worked. I sent it in again. another two weeks... Now. all my movies work. but I have to put the disc in an average of three times before it will read it. Avoid this unit at all costs!  Obviously. Zenith forgot to put the quality in before the name went on.  END,1,0,750
A4116CA7C7MWY,3435,I was up and running with the reader in minutes. It wasnt surprising .because of USBs usual painlessness. but it was appreciated none the less.Transfers directly from my Agfa ePhoto 780c were painfully slow. This reader trounces it in terms of speed. plus. I no longer have to tie up  one of my serial ports or use up my cameras battery during  transfers.Mac compatibility is a plus. especially if you plan on taking  it with you so you can download pictures on almost any computer. even  Windows 2000 machines!...this product is a steal if you use a  digital camera with SmartMedia cards. Its like a trip down easy street.,5,1,623
A41JUIFTT1J4B,44,I got my Rio PMP 300 from my employer as a gift.  It was my first exposure to MP3. as up to that point I had been dismissing it as a fad.  Having the device. and about 150 CDs. I figured why not give it a shot.The installation of the software went smooth.  I found an update. and installed that as well with no problems.  Then I started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable.  I was running on Windows NT. which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer. but with some caveats.  I would start ripping and the software would crash.  I would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash.  I would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didnt actually make it.  Bottom line  the connectivity for this device was pathetic.But speaking for the device itself  I loved it.  The music played cleanly. without interruption. regardless of how much I shook the device.  The buttons on the front are well placed. well labeled. and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access. but you dont have to worry about them protruding.  It has all the features you might want including random and repeat.  The display lets me know how much memory I have. what track number is playing. and the time of the song.  There are also various other indicators that are helpfull .battery. etc...The memory on this device is small  32Mb.  And the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64Mb total with an expansion card.  That expansion card can hold its own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory.  However. vendor chose the odd memory type of 3.3V for the external memory versus typical CompactFlash.Theres a convenient u0026quotlocku0026quot switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering.  This can be good in two ways. it wont get turned on accidentally and burn battery. and you wont accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening.  The belt clip is handy. and detachable. and the battery life .one AA. is quite respectable.In all. I really love my Rio PMP 300.  Its perfect for a trip to the gym. a jog around the neighborhood. or even for a short plane flight.  If all you need is an hour .30 mins on internal memory alone at a 128 sample rate. to pass the time. then you really dont need to spend more  this is the perfect device.,4,1,2409
A42G533KTQSEE,23,As this is my first digicam. I bought the FD73 for its price. simplicity. ease of use. unique diskette storage and large 2.5u0026quot LCD screen. Im not disappointed. to say the least! On my large 20u0026quot computer screen the u0026quotNormalu0026quot modeu0026quot images look just u0026quotFineu0026quot! Even after severely cropping images. they remain remarkably sharp. Love the 10x zoom. Indoors and outdoors out of the sun the LCD screen is great. In u0026quotNormalu0026quot mode I make an average of 25 pictures per diskette.On the down side. I miss the time exposure option. The LCD screen is weak under sunlight. Suggestion. Try positioning yourself in a shaded area. The 120 min. battery empties much faster than that! Avoid battery drainage by turning off the beep and not using the image management menu .deletion. copying. formatting. etc... The user manual doesnt provide much details about camera specifications.,4,1,930
A42GF38T56D3U,99,I am a big FPS .First person shooter. gammer and I love the idea of the button on the side. its feel is nice and the dual scroll feature is great when doing research online.The cons are that they are prone to fail.

A44UKZE6XEV9,0,I purchased a Kindle for my wife last Christmas. She loves it and uses it more than any other gift I ever purchased her. She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasnt sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from Bu0026N and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didnt experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery. its nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. Ill probably never need it but its also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.The new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother. I have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device. I had no problems whatsoever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me.My wife still loves her Kindle but I think she is a little jealous. She asked me why I didnt get her a Nook for Christmas.I was completely in the dark about ereaders until just 2 months ago. I know during my research I found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader I checked into. If you were putting off getting a Nook because of bad reviews. I would give them another look. There has been 2 firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns. Thats not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago. Im sure there will be further updates as time goes on and it will get only better.~eddie,5,1,1954

I did not want red but instead wanted the pink one... but I guess its my fault. I think the seller should put the red elephant as the main picture instead. Anyways. it was still cute. I tried it out on my laptop.. AND IT DOESNT FIT! the way the usb is built is not like standard regular usb flash drives that you could find at Target or Best Buy or something. It is a little bit bigger so it does NOT fit my laptop. I was VERY WORRIED. I tried it out on my computer and it DOES fit.

A4ABNXMETDFGW,33,Ive had the Nook ereader for less than 18 months. Its been ailing for at least 12 of those months. At first. it wouldnt start up for no apparent reason. Id get crazy messages and images on the screen. but no access to function. I went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions. They did. Lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions. The things I had to try were a nuisance but they worked when I was persistent. I learned to fuss around and get the thing started. Then the charger started failing. Id have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the NOOK. That worked for awhile. After awhile. it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so I bought a Nookcompatible charger from Amazon. Good news. It worked. Bad news. It worked for only a week. I called Nook Customer Service. They said I really needed a Barnes u0026 Noble brand charger. So I laid out another USD15 or so. That charger worked for about 3 days.Now the EEG for my Nook has flatlined. No web advice and no Customer Service advice helps. However. in my last conversation with Bu0026N. they told me to take it into a Bu0026N bookstore and have them look at the device. This will be my last ditch effort. If further measures require an investment of more than 10 cents. Ill tell them to pitch it in recycle.I wouldnt have hung in nearly as long if it hadnt been for a NOOK game Im addicted to and can get nowhere else. Time for onlinegamerehab. I guess. I will never buy another Nook. As my kids would say. its a P**** Of S***.Barbara Cox,1,0,1589

A4AO6FZWDEVSY,1929,This CD player is very nice.  It is ultra thin. only 1 inch think. and very lightweight. compared to my Sony Discman that I bought in 1997.  It is very easy to use. all the buttons are pretty straightforward. The display and all the buttons .except hold and open. are on the top. making it very easy to see everything.  The antishock is amazing 45 seconds long. which is currently the best on the market.  I was listening to a CD. and decided to put another one in. and when I opened the player without pressing stop. it kept playing for 45 seconds!  It actually stores all the information in the player.  The radio is also a very nice feature.  It has 25 preset stations. although the reception doesnt come in that great. but thats probably because of where I live.  The supplied headphones are OK. but not great.  I would rather have the behindthehead ones. but these are sufficient.  I am probably going to buy new headphones. The volume is incredibly loud with the supplied headphones the volume scale is from 010. and on a 2 its very loud.  This CD player is definitely one of the best you can buy for this price.  It has bass boost and surround sound.  The contents of the package are the CD player. headphones. 2 Duracell Ultra AAA batteries. an AC adapter. and a manual.  This player is definitely great. and you should buy it if you want a great buy!,4,1,1359

A4DN9SW5DJL5M,11,After lightning came through my phone line. causing my modem to always be open. I ordered a replacement modem through Gateway. This is what they sent me. Its nothing but garbage. which is where it now resides. Takes over a minute just to connect. several minutes to download one page. if they load at all. numerous disconnects. never a speed higher than 30 Kbps .when the old modem was getting between 40 and 44.. and more often in the low 20s. After two weeks I stopped using this modem and am back to the damaged modem which still works better than the Best Data modem. Probably the worst computerrelated purchase Ive made in my life. If I could give this negative stars I would. And the next modem wont be purchased from Gateway.,1,0,732
A4DZOJ79D9BXE,0,They are not exactly noise cancelling as I read in some of the reviews. You can hear the tv a little and the person watching the tv can hear a little bit of the music if its loud. It does allow for the one practicing to hear their music well. For the price Id say its worth it if your child is always practicing the same time you need it to be quiet or the tv is on.,4,1,366
A4G4HWKGH4HU4,0,Ive had this product since christmas.  It took awhile to decide between this and the kindle fire and frankly i wish i had paid more attention to the reviews.  i use this primarily to read. borrowing books from the library. and it is a pain to have to download books to my computer and transfer them to the nook via usb.  i bought a tablet so i wouldnt have to use a full computer as much. but here i am still tethered to it.  and there are apps out there such as overdrive that would allow direct download over wifi that bu0026n refuse to approve and make available through their app store.  which brings me to the second thing i dont like about the nook. and that is bu0026ns restrictive. north korean closed society attitude toward outside apps. what a pity bu0026n chooses not to embrace the full android community.  think of what might have been!  i have no problem surfing the web. and it also works well and looks good watching video from netflix.  my wife has a kindle fire and it is a pleasure to just go to the library site. choose a book. and have it load wirelessly without any fuss over external computers and wires. bu0026nopen your doors and join the rest of the word.,2,0,1182
A4GGT6O0GQNV2,66,For anyone who wants to have total control over what youre DVD movies look and sound like. this is the unit for you. Although the picture and sound are stunning.  If you feel the need to make them even better. The 550  gives you virtualy unlimited control.  And it will save the settings for  two hundred discs.  Just pop the movie in and all your adjustments are  recalled.  But beware if you are moving to DVD after years with a VHS that  flashed 12.00. opt for a simpler player.  Otherwise. you will be paying for  a something that you cant control.  The Sony 330 will deliver fantastic  picture and sound. for USD150 less.  And. as far as the sync problems that  many have reported. I have had the player for two weeks now and have had no  problems what so ever.  Even after checking out many of the reported  problem scenes listed in other reviews.  DVD is the future of home video.  Dont take my word. just look around yourself.  If youre ready to buy.  dont wait.  You wont regret it for a minute.,5,1,1004
A4HIYMV8IRN7C,2225,I have owned the Nikon CoolPix 950 for two months and when I go to turn it on from the electronic adaptor it wont turn on.  If I go back an hour later and try it it turns on and will work fine but every time I try to use  it I have to wonder whether or not it will work.  They dont send enough  documentation to tell where to ask about getting it fixed.  I ordered it  but still dont know who to contact. I use it for my business so am very  concerned.  Id like some help from Nikon.,3,0,483

A4J4DE23XGZCL,0,I had two FA310TX cards and a Netgear FA311TX had problems with all three.  Both of the 310s would stop working after a while  couldnt ping anything or get packets further than the card.  The FA311 started making my machine reboot during online games.  Had problems in NT4 as well as Windows 2000.  In frustration. I spent a little more and bought a 3Com 3C905 and its been rock solid.  Great price and probably a good card for most people. but I had zero luck with it.,2,0,469
A4JFLE8UB61RB,22,I have owned a Palm IIIx for over a year.  I cannot live without it.  But. it has it share of problems.  Lines have appeared on the screen but were cleared up with a hard reset.  I have had to replace the unit once .free of  charge..  It is fragile.  My screen broke .but I have not lost any data.  when it hit my cell phone in my purse.  I am buying a protector for it.  I  have it hooked to Aventgo and read the Wall Street Journal and NY Times  daily.  I recommend it to anyone.,5,1,481
A4JHEO7H330AF,44,I have used Maxell XLII for over two decades.  Ive used them on a Nakamichi 581 cassette deck. a Tandberg TCD320 cassette deck. and small handheld recorders from Sony .with builtin microphone..Ive used the Maxell XLII tapes for recording albums from vinyl. recording from compact discs. and recording live. e.g.. parties. waterfalls. and my own electricguitar playing using a Nakamichi microphone.When I first got my Nakamichi 581. I did a sidebyside test of an actual vinyl record. and my taped copy of the vinyl recording.  I was not able to tell the difference.  This demonstrates the high quality of the Maxell XLII tape.  The particular recording was a duet with Max Roach on drums and Anthony Braxton on saxophone.  This recording was an especial challenge to the tapes ability to record at higher frequencies.  The Maxell tape passed the test. so to speak.  Also. I recently listened to recordings that I made in the year 1980.  I have no reason to believe that the recordings on my Maxell tape have deteriorated.  This is another good thing about the Maxell XLII tape.I have nothing bad to say about the 90 minute Maxell XLII tape.But I do have bad things to say about tape recorders.  First of all. my Tandberg is a risky machine.  Perhaps. one time out of 100 times that I use the Tandberg. the tape gets tangled up.  I blame this on the Tandberg. not on the tape.  Another problem is that my Nakamichi 581 has been broken for many years. and I have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine.  The Nakamichi 581 was. and probably still is. the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind.  But I cant find anybody who can fix mine.  Again. this is not the fault of the tape.Finally. Sony had an excellent little handheld cassette playerrecorder. the TCM454VK.  The sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and childrens music concerts.  However. I dropped this Sony machine. and it broke. and it is not manufactured anymore.  Instead. Sony does make a similar. newer model. but the sound quality of this Sony cassette recorder is garbage .please see my reviews of the newer Sony machine..  But this is not the fault of the tape. Sony TCM200DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder adds a highpitched whining sound to your tapes.  A similar recorder. the Panasonic RQL31 Portable Cassette Recorder with Slide Microphone. adds a highpitched chirping sound to your tapes.The following applies only to recording nature sounds. childrens marching bands. and so on.  The following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discs.Last year. I bought a digital voice recorder. the Olympus DS40.  Please see my review of the Olympus DS40.  The Olympus DS40 is an absolute dream and a miracle   because of the very low background noise. because of the absence of clicking sounds when startingstopping or when pausingrestarting recordings. because of the extreme length of recordability. and because of its extremely compact size.  Therefore. at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds. marching bands. and parties. cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice.,5,1,3183
A4K99TPTQI9LS,44,I returned it  it didnt suit my needs.  I didnt like the grey background when reading.  I ended up buyind a Kindle Fire HD whichI like very much  also it has a slightly bigger screen,2,0,182
A4KCCDSLZ0R8,0,I have just returned from a three week visit to Shanghai. Beijing and Cambodia and used the TRV310 throughout.  Excellent quality video. sharp definitions. striking color. good in low light. This is my fifth 8mm .u0026amp  Hi8. camcorder and it far surpasses anything I have used in past.  Many  visual effectsalmost too many.  Major difference  between this and the  TRV510 is a somewhat smaller foldout screen and black and white viewer.  Modest price compared to full digital cams. Slight and only ocasional  camera noises during high volume playback. Highly recommendednot topof  the line full digital. but one can still use all previous 8mm and Hi8 mm  tapesso if you are trading up you have not forsaken your past.  Good feel  with low light and even 0 lux capabilities. though obviously the quality of  the latter is poor.,4,1,829

A4KQW4S2PAXIT,0,Product was shipped quickly from Toy 4 Kids. At first. I loved it. Its compact. has all kinds of adapters. and very lightweight  seemed perfect for travel. My first night in Italy. it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery .in regular outlet. and ipad .using the USB port.. Unfortunately. after the 2nd night. there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that. Burnt out after just 2 nights?  In short. great idea but very little durability.,1,0,508

A4MAMPMFK3FO5,0,This is a nice CB Radio. The only thing I dont like. is the buttons dont glow or light up in the dark. which makes it hard to use at night time. The light only lights up the LCD to see what channel youre on. but that is about it.,3,0,229
A4MQ4HZF3Q7JV,23,I have used Maxwell for some time. I liked the price and having used these in the past. you can retape over them many. many times. I use them to tape television shows on air after my bedtime. You get good. clear pictures even after several months of taping. I would reorder these again. Also. there are few. if any. places locally to purchase any brand of VHS tapes.,4,1,366
A4OGL6HINEZVL,0,As others have noted. there is only a small amount of velcro to hold.Also. I like the type of ties that you can wrap first around the cable .so you dont lose the tie. and then around the bundle.With the way these work. you cant do that.If you want ties in different colors and you wont be using them much .e.g. wrapping up a cable and storing it in a drawer until you need it. then these might be ok..but for the road warrior trying to keep all his cables organized. pick something else.,2,0,487
A4PSK5CKS0767,0,This is my first cb radio.  It mostly gets used for offroading but because of its versatility. i can use it in any vehicle that I happen to drive.  It does work with the little antenna that comes with it however it gets much better range with an external antenna .currently the little wil..  People say that I come in clear and I seem to pick up a lot of signals.  For the size and conveniece this radio seems just right for my application.  The radio and antenna cost me rigjt at USD100.,5,1,488
A4PYYPWSARFO0,22,This is the second Lautner cover purchased and was for a gift.The first cover was purchased from Barnes and Noble at twice the price. I have been using that cover for a year and a half and it has held up nicely. The inside was dirty from handling over a year. but I was able to wash off most of the dirt and finger oils using a cloth and dish soap. The advantages of this cover is the magnetic closure which can be flipped to hold the cover open when reading. The only disadvantage is that this cover has only two clips to hold the Nook and the Nook sometimes slips out of the clips. Would be better if the cover had four clips to match the four notches on the Nook.,4,1,666
A4Q37YOBC90DG,55,Fun and cute idea.  You need to wet the stand to make it stick to your phone.  Even with wetting the stand it will not stay on for very long.  Might make a cute gag gift. but not really functional.,3,0,197
A4QXQO4O749CW,12,Well. I just read the other reviews and I can agree with some things. but not others. For example. Ive had mine running for hours at a time and havent had the slightest problem. Maybe thats just his. I think the sound is great and so are the features. The only problem Ive had is that if  there is even the slightest scratch on a disc. it sometimes has a hard time  reading it. On the other hand. a disc can have a big scratch on it and it  reads it just fine. Go figure. Anyway. now that the price has gone down on  these cdjukeboxes. Ill probably get Pioneers 101 disc player to replace  my 25. seeing as its u0026lt...u003e less than the price I originally paid for the 25  a few years ago. In conclusion. this is a good player with a good price and  Im sure the amount of u0026quotlemonsu0026quot are few.,4,1,809

A4SPPOE9HOMTA,2021,I have used my Nook for almost a year and its one of the best purchases I have ever made!I read so many more books than I ever did before.  I love that many of the classics are Free.  Its the most convenient thing to be able to bring along 400 of my favorite books wherever I go.I chose the Nook over the kindle for the touch screen. the ability to go into the Barnes u0026 Nobles store if I have issues and my the ability to download Library books.  I highly recommend Nooks!!,5,1,477
A4SVJ7V6HZF9U,44,put this tape and just push play and it cleans your vcr.

After playing the tape twice I now have a crystal clear picture and a normal voice on the  vcr playback!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,1,316
A4SZ62RJ8GRMY,22,I have noticed that most of the reviews regarding this product are recent.  I bought an AIWA system for my college age son.  We both felt it was a great value for the money until one month past the warranty expiration when  the CD changer quit working.  A couple of months later. the tape deck went  out.  Everyone my son knows with an AIWA product has run into the same  problem. My college age daughter reports the same. I tried contacting AIWA.  but their web site does not even provide a way to send an email.  After an  extended wait on their 800 number. I was told there was nothing they could  do once a product was 3 months past warranty other than charge what I  considered an exorbitant fee for repair.  Bottomline. if wellcared for  AIWA systems barely last more than a year. how great is the value?,1,0,810
A4UMQLZ0O489D,6667,I have owned this camera for over 9 months now and I really like it. The image quality is stunning and I didnt find it all that hard to figure out how to use it. The controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomically.The camera is also slow .I think this is true with most  digital cameras.. You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal. but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son. and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.A significant short coming is  the built in flash. Its nowhere near powerful enough. even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is 4 feet away. Images often come  out too dark. This wouldnt be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash. but there doesnt seem to be one. Also. the camera tends to  create u0026quotred eyeu0026quot a lot. which you can correct if you have  PhotoShop. but thats more work than I want to do.The camera does eat up  a lot of power. I agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries. You can get a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for about USD20  bucks .it takes 4 AA batteries.. Id suggest getting at least 8 AA  batteries.I do suggest getting extra memory .I have 32 megs. and one of  those USB memory card readers. its a lot faster than a serial port.,4,1,1393

A4VA7AY5G19MI,0,As far as the audio quality is concerned. Im well satisfied with this headset. I use it almost continuously when Im working in my office.

A4YF160Z2596D,0,I first grew acquainted with Autostar about 6 months ago .albeit the 494 model. on the ETX70 AT. and had some accuracy issues the first few times I used it.  They were easily fixed. though. with a good drive training .on a power pole about a mile and a half away. and careful motor calibration.  That was in May. and except for when the batteries are low. I havent really had problems since.In late June. I moved up to the LXD55 6 inch ShmidtNewtonian .which uses the same 497 Autostar as the ETX line.. and after one repair call for a motor problem it has easily met my expectations for visual work. While the short focus Newtonian may have a wider field of view and a much better sigting scope than the ETXs .as well as significantly more aperture for under USD800.. keep in mind that it must be POLAR aligned which is MUCH more difficult than an ETX AltAz procedure.  I usually cheat and use Polaris instead of the true North Pole. but my accuracy is still predictibly within 3045 arcminutes .1234 of a degree or easily within the view of a 26mm eyepiece. on 9095 percent of the slews with a rough setup.Heres how to get the thing to work the way its supposed to on an ETX when you first get it.  Do the first 6 in daylight to make the setup easier.*Skip Time for now*Enter Date .if you will observe that night. and nearest city*Enter your observing site name and adjust your latitude and longitude .use topozone.com or a topomap to find your location to the nearest minute .60th of a degree.. for your site*Train the drive using a distant .1 mile or more. object. Procedure is in manual. If done well you should not need to do it again for months*calibrate motors*turn off telescopeThat night .or any night..*set up and level telescope .use torpedo level and rotate tube to check level..  This is only necessary if you know that your site is significantly .5 degrees or more. off or your tripod is set to less than maximum height*Aim north at Polaris .the North Star.. Do NOT use a compassit is often as much as 14 degrees off from true north.  Use the two stars at the end of the big dipper to aim at the first brightish star at the tail of the little dipper. Align finder scope if necessary her.*level tube by bringing it straight down to horizontal*start alignment .easy at first. two star when you know the sky better.. push the down scroll button if the star is behind a tree or other barrier. center in the eyepiece. not just the sighting scope. Press enter. Repeat for other star .preferably far from the first onethe farther the better.*Enjoy!For the long term. get a star atlas or astronomy program and a range of good eyepiecesfilters.I deducted a star for the fact that Autostar displays thousands of objects nightly that are below the horizon and that the NGC and IC catalogs are nearly worthless unless you have a comprehensive atlas and know the catalog number of the object.s. you are looking for.,4,1,2916

A51D2RXPNEOLT,1,This was the worst thing I ever bought.  I thought it would help me to get organized. like the name suggests.  But instead. all I found was hours of trouble trying to get this thing set up.  Once I finally got it working. it  said it downloaded my mail. but all it did was succesfully delete a letter  from my Boss!  It included the deadline for a project. that I never  recieved. thus I did not make the deadline and was fired!  I was completely  disorganized for weeks while I tried to get a hold of everything I lost.  I  think that the people who named this combobulation machine an organizer  should read the english dictionary.  An Organizer is one that organizes.  not one the disorganizer. and deletes my email! Apart from that. this  thing would not run any of the games I downloaded from it. and it also kept  losing all of the memos and stuff I put on it.  Maybe if the makers would  have made a more stable OS. I would have been able to recommend this  product.,1,0,973
A51SQFC8HK6GS,662,This keyboard has fantastic feel to it. I did talk to many people who say that they just cannot get used to it. I am used to it and enjoying it after 5 minutes of use. I dont feel pain in my wrists anymore which is the big plus. However. this keyboard does have couple of immense mistakes in its design of arrow keys and shortcuts such as u0026quothomeu0026quot. u0026quotendu0026quot. etc. Arrow keys are not alligned in a usual way. they are much more compact as well as shortcut keys which is. for me. A BIG problem. For half an inch of space. this keyboard did lose a lot of points. Also. the keyboard is very high. which means that if you have a desk where the base slides. you are in truble. In all. this product does have an excellent feel as far as typing goes. however. there are many more flaws to it. Honstly I would rather buy Professional version of this keyboard. and pay more monay for it. That is why I give this product grade of three stars minus.,3,0,964

A53GPDEU2HHP5,0,I am very pleased with the V3 2000 I received this week.Performance has been rocksolid in both 3D and 2D. I chose this card largely based on a value model measuring 3D framespersecond per dollar. This seems like a good way to sidestep the religious nature that the 3D card debate has  taken.My other considerations were software compatibility. screen image  appearance in 3D. and 2D performance superior to my previous 2D card. With  early drivers from 3dfx. the Voodoo3s 2D performance was reported to be a  weaker point of this card. but with drivers available now I see a  noticeable 2D boost over my machines stock 2D card. the IMSixMicro Twin  Turbo 128 8MA. My whole system is more responsive and actually seems more  stable. And. yes. all my 3D games are gorgeous and fluid under this card at  any resolution I please. .Note. I have yet to test Q3A.. Naturally. Im  using the card on a platform that 3dfx doesnt even support or warrant...at  least not ``officially.If you buy this card for a Macintosh. this is  an important thing to know. While my own experience has been fun.  considering the product wasnt even packaged or intended for my platform.  Id buy from a retailer with a liberal return policy. just in case you were  to run into difficulty with. say. flashing the cards ROM .which ships for  WindowsPC use. with the ROM image that 3dfx supplies on the net for Macs.  Not to worry otherwise. 3dfx has done a bangup job of .not?. supporting  the Mac. Mac driver updates show up at 3dfxgamers.com every week or two.3dfx is apparently considering whether to support the Mac only through  other board makers as in the past. or to finally go directly to Mac  consumers with their brand.,5,1,1699

A5A4374R8I7NB,0,This PDA came out in mid2004. and it was a great PDA for this period.  Mine is still functional in 2012.I have had numerous PDAs from the Palm M Series to HPs Jornada and IPAQ to a Toshiba and an ASUS MyPal A716. This Dell Axim A30 unit is by far  hands down  the most impressive unit that I have used.The unit is quite light and the display is very vibrant compared to the ASUS A716 .also still functional after all these years.. It does not hang wile multitasking or viewing pictures  soft resets are few and far between.Even refurbished. these are very reliable  an allinone gadget for all your needs .I prefer having my contacts on a device that is not my phone.. Shame that it does not come with a bottle and can opener or you would have a complete survival tool for urban living!,4,1,785

A5E0ILXXXJQJH,0,This radio has been on sale in the sub range.  I have read countless reviews and purchased two units.  Both units work well.  There are GESuperadio websites and discussion groups on the web with lots of info.  This radio has worked well on AM near a window at work .lots of computers there. and has worked well on AM and FM at home.  This isnt a communication receiver but my experience is that one gets more stations and with better reception especially on AM than most any other basic AMFM radio.  I find FM to work well also.  This radio is recommended by many radio stations for listeners who are getting marginal reception.  For radio experimenters it is eminently modifiable.  A loop antenna can further improve its performance on AM.  I am not a sound quality freak but anyone can discern that the sound is very good.  It has external antenna terminals and earphone jack.,4,1,878
A5F1VYKN8SU4M,89,This thing makes the Palm a complete and useful system. I live in Alaska so dont get a lot of opportunity to shop around for other options. and this looked like it would do the trick as a case. It does protect my Palm.  but thats not whats really nicest about it. Whats nicest. I discovered.  is that my drivers license and credit card fit in the back of the case  .with the graffiti quickreference stickers inside the front flap. and now  its all I carry in my back pocket as a wallet.,4,1,486

A5GPLWZZA1DJA,0,Ive had and used q 370Z for over a year. and Ive never had a bad snapshot that wasnt the photographers fault.  Yes. I sometimes get redeye in low light. but a lot of that is caused by the compactness of the camera  the flash is too close to the lens to avoid ALL redeye. Increasing the room lights helps. Other family menbers have had a series of 35mm Pointandshoots. but the 370Z is better.  Reliable .at least for me.. simple to use. with a zoom range that goes from true wideangle .most dont. to portraitlength telephoto .the regular ELPH doesnt..  I still have my 35mm SLRs and 7 lenses for u0026quotseriousu0026quot photography. but it sure is easier to carry the ELPH 370.,5,1,678

A5K3MY209ABZR,0,This truly pocket size tv is ruggedly costructed and stands up to being carried around quite well.  Its durability is almost in the class of the Sony Watchman. still the benchmark for miniature television.  Performance.  while certainly adequate for a portable TV has three major shortcomings. 1.  The color is often too rich and the tint is not totaly acurate and varies  too easily with reception.  2. The flourescent backlight is located such  that the brightness tends to be uneven leaving the top and bottom of the  picture slightly dark with respect to the center.  3. The AM band on the  radio is not quite sensitive enough to reliably receive weak local  stations.  I also noticed that the tuner is sometimes slow to lock onto the  nearest station when the set is first turned on.  This is not a defect but  rather a characteristic of the circuit design and certainly is no reason  not to buy this set.If you are not too picky about an absolutely perfect  picture on a pocket TV then this set will serve you well for years.  The  built in radio is a real plus that more manufacturers should consider  offering.  This set is worth buying for the TVradio combination alone.  The TV picture is bright with high contrast and reasonably sharp.  Unless  you are a perfectionist spoiled by the pure precision of Sony sets like I  am. you will be very happy with this set.,3,0,1372
A5K62GOUAJREJ,2020,When I bought this product. the price seemed right. and the sound was great. Overtime however. my control pad wore out smooth!  My battery mechanism holder broke!  And the headphones broke as well!  I got a  replacement pair. but those eventually broke too. The Rio offers an hour of  music storage.....which is only true if you use 64kbps!  Pretty much  cassette tape quality. An expansion card will allow the Rio to hold more.  but at almost 100USD!  The sound never TRULY disappointed me. but it should  be noted that it ISNT EVER CD quality. NEVER. It takes away bass from songs  to allow more volume. The durability on this product is a joke. The  software that came with it was efficient. but not great. It would be more  cost efficient to get a CDRecorder and make CDs rather than to use this!  Dont waste your money!  Get an Mp3 player from a better company such as  Creative. or possibly even Sony.,3,0,907
A5LT4YDSNS4BD,23,Everything works great with the headphones.  I have tried it all over the house and even in the garage while running power tools.  I have noticed little or no interference doing this.  Next I am going to try mowing the lawn with them! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would prefer Li Ion or NiMH rechargeables instead of NiCad because of the memory issues.  Otherwise a great buy.,4,1,394

A5MY3D9WGQAHI,2,If your considering the purchase of this based on the previous reputation of Maxell. think again. This DVD seems to have a mind of its own as to whether it activates once you place it into your DVD player. If you do end up with the screen prompts dont consider yourself one of the lucky few! It does not possess the quality or capability to properly clean the DVD laser in the very least! Complete and utter junk.Fools rush in. were wise men never go...,1,0,453
A5MZIPAP7VUOU,68,This was the worst radio I ever tried in over 60 years.  It only tuned one strong local AM station and that took up a large part of the dial.  Another local AM station that all 9 radios in the house receive with ease could not be tuned in.  I think I believe the reviews. though. and assume that the quality of current production is so poor or variable that a number of these radios. with once a good reputation. can no longer be expected to function.  They were quick to refund my money.,1,0,488
A5N6CY3KJVZV6,910,Loved the Webcam for the first year until I upgraded my PC to Windows XP. 3COM did not support this OS and the product was useless. Paid USD200.00 for one years use. Shame on you 3COM!,1,0,184
A5NXPT48BLG39,0,Low price. spotty picture quality As a disposablepriced VCR this is fine its unsuitable for dubbing tapes though. It worked fine right out of the  box. and the onscreen time counter etc. worked fine.I bought this VCR  to save a little money. and Ill keep it rather than go to the trouble and  postage for an exchange. You get what you pay for in this case.The case  is smaller and much lighter than most VCRs that Ive handled. and the input  and output jacks are well labelled. This would make a good VCR for a  childs room or playroom. I think. Since the display quality is like a  mediocre tapedub job. this wouldnt do as a second VCR for copying tapes.  Since the buttons and printing on the remote control are very tiny. a  separate remote would be a must if the machine is meant for a childs use.  I strained to read the lettering myself.Its working fine so far .I  havent tried the programming functions.. The image quality for a good tape  is mediocre. faces and so on look a bit smeared and theres some aliasing  visible .as with lower quality computer images.. This problem might be  caused by the tape heads. .I imagine the quality would be just fine for  most cartoons though.. As important. it adds a lot of bright specks to the  picture when the scenery is very dark .and the picture is properly colored  when the scenery is bright.. I think this darknessproblem is electronic  and not caused by the tape heads. If you like movies with dimly light  bedroom scenes. or soldiers creaping through the shadows. the bright  flickering noise will bug you.Personally. if I could rewrite the  original order. Id spend a bit more since the VCR is for me. This price is  not a slashdown sale sort of deal. or a clearance deal its in line with  the quality. Its a bit hard to believe that Toshiba actually made it.,2,0,1816
A5O11P25SIMQQ,961,Dont be fooled by the other reviews if you are looking for supreme performance.  If you are looking for a good portable boombox. then this is definately the best option.  If you are searching for true sound. you are  far from it here.  While the bass is resonant. it is hardly consistent with  the rest of the equalization. not to mention quite muddy.  Dont use the  ACS feature.  It just makes the sound blotchy.  I purchased one and am  satisfied. but i still wouldnt agree with those reviewers proclaiming this  machine as one to be worshipped.  Also. while being one of the sturdiest  boomboxes available. it is still quite fragile.,3,0,636

A5Q4GEXKZBBI9,11,I plan to rotate the open cover. then insert the Kindle.  I plan to cut a slit so that the notebook could be inserted from the opposite end.  Moleskine could have made this product for lefties or righties using only a wide band to hold the notebook.,3,0,249

A5RPKO4LEXYIB,0,My wife gave me this camera for my birthday. I only had 1 sereal port on my computer. so  shopped around for the disk to use. so I could down load pictures without using the sereal port. Have enjoyed the camera for the  last month. cannot wait to take pictures at a zoo.  Have taken some of our  animals .Dogs and Casts. and they are clear I realy enjoy the camera.  however the battery life is to short.  Will invest in rechargable ones for  the summer.  Where can I buy extra memory cards.  Thank you Poloraid for a  great camera.,4,1,532
A5SF6XG0IIBEF,89,This suits my needs well enough for me to not have to worry. The SD card itself seems to work with my Windows Phone.I should mention that this apparently came with an Android app preinstalled. so you wont get all of the storage capacity. However. there was still plenty left for me to use .almost 60GB. so Im not too worried about it.Also. is it just me or did this thing try to get my location when booting up. without the app being installed?,3,0,444
A5THRKFO1IPEL,0,I ordered this. and signed up for the free trial of Prime. which allowed me to have free 2 day shipping. i ordered on a sat. so it took an extra day but i had it when promised .thats extra day was because of a sunday. not amazon. i checked and they had it shipped 56 hours after i ordered it. I had an issue with it at first. because when i tried to use the car adapter i had the same high pitched sound some have complained about that came over everyone elses radio and they couldnt hear me. a quick call to Midland solved the problem. If your useing the rubber ducky antenna as i have to. .no way to run wires to mount a regualr one in my convertable. not to mention limited real estate to mount it to. you have to take a piece of electric tape and place it over the antenna contact on the bottom of the radio. if you dont then its trying to put out through both the short antenna. AND the enternal antenna wire. which. and im no electronice expert. i would guess causes some kind of feed back. one little square of tape and my problem was solved. i searched all day looking for a fix online and found nothing. so i hope this helps some people.  over all i am satisfied with it. the range is short. but better for me because of the soft top .not as much metal to get in the way. but i only wanted it for short range line of sight to friends with mobiles and the occational trucker i work with on way to and from work.,4,1,1419

A5US5UZ4SVGK0,0,I purchased this item to charge a GARMIN nuvi 50LM u0026 265W in the house as the packaging did not include a home charger.  It takes FOREVER.  To get fully charged it has to be plugged in anywhere fron 3648 hours. I have tried to locate an OED Garmin home charger but apparently they dont have any for these older models so if you are looking for a quick charge for your Garmin GPS this is not for you.,1,0,403
A5V88D7KFLRRP,0,I thought for the price it would be a complete kit. Its OEM! Its just a bare drive. no cable. no driver. manual  nothing.

A5WAZ7PEUDTBX,811,Though a little pricier than most other shower radios. this one is worth it.  Excellent design features that one would expect from Sony.  all buttons are the membrane type. so no worry about water seeping into the unit  all digital tuning. it locks in the stations beautifully. even the TV and weather band.  Will go for months without need of fresh batteries.  .I play mine about 12 hour daily.. The only minor disappointment is tone quality.  Frequency response could be little wider on both the low and high ends. But hey. how high of performance can you expect for any waterproof speaker?,4,1,592
A5X3DVSN6XRJ1,0,I recently bought a Nook and when I bought it home for the first time. I was impressed. The user interphase .much improved over Nook 1st gen. was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list UI of the new Kindle touch. Holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the Kindle touch desperately lacks. Hardware and software wise. the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use eReader.However. when I started to look for books to purchase .they were about investing if you were curious.. out of the five books I tried to find. I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted. I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews. and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are. but the truth is. Bu0026N still has a ways to go.I am aware the the Nook supports epub which allows it to read generic pdf files .something that the Kindle cant do.. but one of the features I look for in ereaders is convenience. Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient. If only this device had the Kindle store on it...Bottom line. When you buy an ereader. youre also buying into the manufacturers entire ecosystem. With the Kindle. youre buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer thats not going away anytime soon. With the Nook. youre buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the ereader space.Two word recommendation. Research selection .before purchase.I hope Ive helped.,3,0,1652
A5XR27ZFIRJI8,33,I have been using the 6Disc DXC540 for about ten years. Once a CD got stuck inside. My brother and I took the unit apart. extracted the stuck CD. and put it back together. Other than that. no problems. This CD changer has a somewhat warm. almost analoglike sound. in a good way. I have used it with various amps receivers. and speakers. and only now with my NAD C372 int. amp does the Onkyo sound not quite as great as I thought it used to. Still. the NAD brings out the best in it.  I have just bought a Sony CDPCA70ES 5Disc changer on Ebay. When I get it. Ill pull the Onkyo to compare the two units. Should be interesting. I believe the DXC540 has been superseded by the Onkyo DXC380. The 540 has more frontpanel versatility and most likely. the 380 is more current internally...DAC. MP3. and such. Anyway. the 540 has served me well for quite a few years and reliably so.,4,1,875

A601IGAG8FWGW,0,This case looks nice and has plenty of pockets for all the other stuff you have to carry around.  But. if youre using it for something other than back and forth to the office or have a thinner laptop. there is just not enough padding in here to protect the computer from scratching and rubbing.  We bought this for my son for school this past Fall.  He has one of those thinner laptops and the cover was soon dented and scratched and the constant rubbing of the screen on the touchpad controls left little white marks on the display.  While you can blame the computer design some. after we added more padding in the case. we had no more problems. On the plus side. the case is durable  nothing has yet ripped or torn off  and its easy to spot clean.,3,0,749

A63BTA965XT5J,1316,I ordered this camera thinking it was waterproof as the other review said it was. When I opened the box the instructions said not to submerse in water.

A63WW5UC6KU18,1,I owned these speakers for about 8 months. and by the end of those 8 months. I needed new speakers.I use my computer primarily for playing games. listening to music. and watching DVD movies. in that order. When I first got the FPS2000s. I was thrilled with their sound and ease of use. First. the pros.These speakers are tiny. and you can put them virtually anywhere in the room. They take up little space. and pack a whollop for their size. The subwoofer is about the size of a shoebox. and fits well under a desk. The contents are packed very intuitively. with the speakers and their wires wrapped individually in the top portion of the box and the subwoofer hidden in the bottom.Setup is more or less a snap. but it takes at least 30 minutes. You are required to label each speaker and its wires with the provided stickers. This makes it easy to identify the front and rear speakers in case you decide to move them. and makes wiring easier. The front speakers are supplied with 9 foot cords. and the rears with 16 foot cords. All attach to the back of each speaker and to the subwoofer with wire clamps.The most convenient piece of equipment in this package is the volume control knob. It plugs separately into your subwoofer and can be attached to the side of your monitor or your desk with a sticky pad. It has a dial that turns the speaker system on and off and controls the volume. and a separate one that controls balance.The performance of these speakers is quite impressive. given their wattage rating .a piddly 7 wattschannel for each satellite. plus a 30 watt subwoofer.. Coupled with any of the Sound Blaster Live! sound cards. you have the option of digital audio. which makes connection to your soundcard much easier and provides for better sound.For games. these speakers are pretty good. but nothing extraordinary. The sub doesnt pack enough power. so you dont u0026quotfeelu0026quot the game. For music. midlevel sounds are lacking. so MP3s and even CD audio wont sound rich and deep. but rather high and almost tinny. depending on the volume. Movies sound best on this system. The surround sound really kicks in here. and when positioned properly .and provided that the room is small enough.. these speakers create a wall of virtual sound. The sub fares better here. and literally shook my dorm room when I played u0026quotSaving Private Ryan.u0026quotHowever. after several months of use. the speakers wore down and emitted static at higher volumes when the bass became too much. The power wasnt enough for my liking. and after reading reviews of the Klipsch ProMedia 4.1 .I highly recommend those.. I decided it was time to move on.In short. these speakers are an excellent value. and sound tremendous for the price you pay. The packaging and setup is well done. and the speakers are amazingly loud for their size. However. movie buffs. gamers. and people that like their music will quickly tire of the lack of raw power. The entire system has a total of 58 watts. less than just one of my Klipsch satellites. and after a while this lack of power shows. Overall though. a solid package from Cambridge. .85100.,4,1,3130

A665UGC0PD5VL,0,I purchased these batteries to use in a small baby monitor that requires 9volt batteries.  Alkalines lasted a good week of the monitor being on quite often these rechargeables last about 2 days on average.  I discovered they are really only 7.2volt batteries .hidden in the packaging. but they work with my monitor just fine.  The batteries take 10 to 13 hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous!  I guess they pay for themselves over time. and seem to be the best 9volt rechargeable product that is out there. but it is almost a step backward from alkaline batteries.,3,0,578

A67JP5CSU3SGQ,55,One reviewer that gave five stars said it you could get six uses out of it before you had to rewind it the cleaning tape. which I hoped for.I was sad when I ran the cleaning tape and it only lasted 1015 seconds before it stopped and had to be rewound.  The instructions say run it for 20 seconds and then remove. reuse another 20 seconds after 20 hours of VCR use.  When tape is at end. simply rewind and reuse again and again.Instructions dont say how many uses I will get before I have to rewind but if I am to believe one five star review. I should have 6 x 20 seconds or 2 minutes of cleaning tape.  I dont know if I got a defect. but there is only 1015 seconds of cleaning tape on mine total.maxell? guess I cant complain since it was only several bucks.  It might have worked. dont know if nonperfect picture is from old tape.s. or VCR.  I was trying to get best picture possible before transferring to DVD.  Hopefully the 1015 seconds did more good than bad.Why 1 star from me. tape doesnt even play as long as instructions say before rewinding is necessary.,1,0,1065
A680RUE1FDO8B,1213,Obviously these headphones are not for the audiophile. Nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or more.These headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package. Commuters. some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these. They fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you. The headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it in.The earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear. .Ive been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort..If you dont demand much in the way of bass or treble. the audio range is acceptable. As I said. these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said. distortion isnt a problem even with the audio cranked up.These headphones dont pretend to be noisecancelling. They are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor. They are sturdy within a limited degree and should last for several months. Considering their price. the need to replace them from time to time is hardly a pain.Overall. a good value as long as you dont demand or expect more than the product can deliver.Jerry,5,1,1413

A6C5MYVHNBJJA,1,The ViewSonic E771 has been with me through college using two different computer systems. As a Computer Science major. it has been through a lot of use. The picture is crisp. colorful. and bright.At about two years into its life. it started malfunctioning. The monitor was caught in an odd resolution. I called ViewSonic. and without any hassle they had me send it in. They sent me back a new one in no time. even though I had no receipts or original packaging.As a basic 17 inch monitor with no frills or extras. the E771 does a great job. I definitely recommend this monitor along with any ViewSonic monitor. ViewSonic is a very trustworthy company that stands behind its products.,4,1,683
A6CT51FUL6UT8,22,Nice compact little radio that fits on most motorcycles. Ride in a club where many members have these. One of the only suitable CB for a bike that doesnt come with an OEM CB. Range will depend on antenna. Rubber unit that attaches to the radio and is part of the package is good for short distances. Would guess 14 mile or so depending on the terrain and conditions. Weather band is a nice feature as is the cigarette lighter external antenna connector. Also comes with two battery packs and a charger for the pack that uses 8 AA rechargeable batteries. I am currently trying eneloop batteries in the unit. The other battery pack holds 6 regular AA batteries. Both battery packs as well as the cigarette adaptor slide on and off easily so you have plenty of options. I dont see why 6 rechargeable batteries couldnt be used i the 6 battery holder. You would just have to charge them in the other pack or a regular charger.,4,1,921
A6DJJKB8YUNK2,0,I purchased three of these units for use in three shops that needed music to complete the store ambiance.  I paid USD70 at Home Depot for the first set and USD35 at an online outlet for the other two.The first set worked okay for the first week with intermittent static that could be remedied with a speaker retuning and this prompted me to purchase the other two sets... I searched on Froogle to find the cheaper price.Problems Ive found with these sets include.The speakers receive static depending on if someone has walked in the transmitters path.The transmitter stops for no apparent reason and the power adapter must be removed and replugged to the transmitter to get it going again.  u0026lt This happens more if a slow or quiet song is playing.The speakers are individually tuned by dial.  The speakers are placed above the store fixtures in order to get the widest sound spread.  Having to individually tune the speakers everytime static begins to come across in tedious.These speakers are pretty much useless unless you love the sound of static or no sound at all.,1,0,1074
A6DT8CT4PWF4N,1010,This radio has outstanding AM and FM reception compared to standard radios. I live in the northern part of Toronto and can clearly recieve Buffalo AM stations which is not the case with the other radios I own.I  dont have enough experience with Shortwave to speak to the quality of that  feature.Each band .AM. FM. SW1 and SW2. has 6 memory presets. In  addition. you can direct enter any frequency you want which is rare in a  radio these days.My only complaint about this radio is its behaviour  when the batteries run low. Instead of just shutting itself off for good.  this Grundig radio starts to reproduce static and will shut itself off when  a crackle is particularly loud. Yet you can turn the radio back on and it  will go for another 5 minutes.,4,1,755
A6E13VCMW78ZH,1010,I should have read the other reviews better before buying the bag.  Kodak has a nice idea. but the bag just isnt big enough.,1,0,124
A6F6HE86W3A4V,55,I bought the 5mx about a month ago and have had great luck with it.  It works well with my home pc and transfers text flawlessly and easily.  The only problem I have had is it sometimes doesnt want to connect to my home pc and I have to keep clicking on connect until it does.  I love all of the features.  The keyboard takes a little to get used to. but now I can type about 30 wpm with it.  If you have large fingers. this probably wont work for you.  I love the spreadsheet. the u0026quotdaytimeru0026quot. the notebook for daily lists. and how easy it is to download some awesome programs from the internet including lots and lots of books.  I havent dealt with customer service since I have had no problems with it at this point.  If you want a word processor. spreadsheet. address book. ebooks. and lots of games to entertain you.  this is the u0026quotcomputeru0026quot for you.  If you need more. look for a notebook computer.  I am happy with the battery life as well as it being lightweight.  I take it backpacking and use the tape recorder to record notes and then at night. I type out my notes.  It works great for this.  So far. I have suggested this little beauty to several friends.  A color screen would be the only additional feature I would like.  I have 3 books. 8 games.  lots of notes and addresses and have only used about 14 of the memory.,5,1,1362
A6FIAB28IS79,1616,Not having either a DVD or CD player .I just feed discs to my iMac.. I found the discounted price on this model to be all the rationale I needed to invest in such a device.  Its capable of producing flawless images and soundsunless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive. which happens far too often with my temperamental .fastidious?. machine.  I would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions. as this model requires extra deep shelves.  Finally. its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with GE or other RCA monitors than with  Philips. Magnavox. or Sylvania monitors.  .It may be important to remember that  a VCR plus DVD assembly requires running the latter in u0026quotauxilliary mode.u0026quot which is hidden away somewhere in my sets menu choices and virtually inaccessible..  In short. the machine has done little to alter my high regard for similar products produced by Sony. Panasonic. and other Japanese manufacturers.,3,0,982
A6HIYEJGCE1MA,33,Ive owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far. I agree with the other customers about the manual... it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language. not three languages together in one  page. But the camera is very easy to use. takes excellent pictures and has  many nice features. With a tripod. you can take great pictures at night  without the flash! The software is also very easy to use. Although its not  documented in the manual. the camera comes with a TWAIN driver. so you can  choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your  favorite photo editing software.,5,1,630
A6IXG5WSHJ7U6,1818,This radio does have okay sound. but the major problem I have with this radio is you cant see the slide dial that selects the stations.  Contrary to the picture. its very diffilcult to see the stations. the numbers for the station arent light enough to see. I think their actually grey and against a black background forget it.Once I get another radio. Im giving this one to the Goodwill.,2,0,388
A6J6BDVUO3OD2,0,i Use the cable to watch on my hdtv screen or a for a field monitor. Nothing fancy but does the job. No problems here.,4,1,118

A6JEVJCN12Z44,11,I got this a weekandahalf ago and put CyanogenMod on it and it runs smoothly. Nothing is instantaneous. but everything is quick.,4,1,128
A6JFYV0P26OJ7,1,I purchased a Midland 74105XL as a gift. but gave it a quick test to make sure all was well before wrapping it up. and it performed exactly as could be expected.I compared it to an Oregon Scientific WR8000 All Hazards portable and an Icom ICM3A marine VHF handheld radio. Reception quality was good on the active weather channels in this area. however there werent any alert warnings broadcast at the time. so I  cant comment on that feature. The Midland was a bit better than the Oregon Scientific. probably due to its telescoping antenna vs. the short rubber ducky type on the WR8000. The Icom being a transceiver. and having a more sensitive receiver was better than both. The AMFM section of the 74105XL works as well as any inexpensive portable radio.The build quality of the 74105XL is also typical of an inexpensive radio .and typical for Midland.  sort of cheap feeling. but perfectly adequate for tabletop use. I  had posted a negative review here on Amazon.com on the similarly featured Midland WR10 All Hazards radio based on its less than userfriendly design. Fortunately. the layout of the 74105XL is much more straightforward.Something thats probably applicable to just about every All Hazards radio currently in use in the U.S. is the quality .or. lack of. artificial speech used for NOAAs weather radio broadcasts. Up until a couple years ago. the broadcasts were recorded by a real. live human. They have since been replaced by a computer synthesized voice. and it sounds just like what you might expect  very artificial. According to the NOAA weather radio site ...... they are currently in the process of upgrading all of their stations with a newer technology. more natural sounding speech system. They even have sample audio files available for audition.The 74105XL does not feature the SAME specific area warning system. so its probably best suited to milder climes or environments where a highly localized warning may not be as essential. As a good. basic weather radio. the 74510XL does the job. By the way. the recipients I gave the radio to are happy with it!,4,1,2085
A6JHWO98IB3U4,45,When installing the lock. the instructions are easy to follow once you get the hang of it. but one important detail is left out  there are two small metal pieces right next to the center lock mechanism.  These have to aligned horizontally to the Kensington security port before putting the lock in place.  This is common sense. perhaps. but it took me a few minutes to figure out what to do and how to do it.  There are no written instructions so if you find the pictures confusing you could be lost.The lock fit surprisingly loosely into the security port... but this isnt exactly a good thing.  Enough pryingpullingjiggling of the lock would definitely damage the laptop.Like everyone here has already said. this lock is basically a deterrent.  It wont work well as an actual theft spoiler. but a laptop left in public with this lock installed is probably a lot safer than one without.,3,0,887
A6K9A1FE7XYUK,22,After graduating from the Sony FX11 8M .top of the line in its time.to the TRV310 the only real noticible difference was the picture sharpness. color left a little to be desired. What really upset me was the grain i was getting in different lighting situations. My old Sony 8M w1 lux was  superior in this respect. Not pleased at all I took it back and purchased  the TRV87 Hi8 which replaces the famed TRV66..Same camera except the TRV87  plays Standard 8M tapes as well as Hi8. In comparison to the digital8 310  model. the picture claritysound were the same. the Hi8 had truer color  reproduction. longer battery life. longer recording times and is superior  in filming in low light conditions with its 0.7 Minimum lux compared to  the 4.0 minimum lux of the Digital8 cameras. Forget the Nightshot feature  on both cameras. horrible. So.in my opinion the Sony TRV87  Hi8. you get an overall superior camera with a proven track record. The  Digital 8 models definately needs improving to exceed the Hi8 in overall  performance to warrant their higher price. BTW. I just love the TRV87. an  awesome camera in every respect.,1,0,1124
A6K9A1FE7XYUK,2629,Being DVD is relatively new i didnt want to go overboard on a high end model that cannot give me a sharper picture or sound. Having read some of the reviews. Im holding my breath. Ive had mine 2 months now and so  far..so good. Not one problem. In comparion to the VCR. i was amazed at how  vibrant the colors were and the clarity of the picture vs. a VCR. One must  have a TV that delivers about 500 lines of resolution to fully appreciate  the clarity of the DVD player.,4,1,472
A6L2WUINA0JME,22,As a stand alone Ereader it is good but overpriced.  I need the backlit screen because I like to read in bed. and my wife hates any external lights.  However. with a little technical knowledge and a micro SD card. this device can also become an inexpensive android tablet.  Android 2.1 is already installed. so with a few simple steps located easily on any internet search engine. you can have your ereader and a decently powered Android tablet as well.  A stock Nook Color would receive 3.5 stars due to the high price tag. but with the android capability. I give it a 5.  Just make sure you know what you are doing before you modify your device because I am fairly sure it voids any warranty.,5,1,694
A6LAFVB3WUUMT,23,I won this camera through ClubPhoto and though I have limited experience with digital cameras. this was a breeze to use. I found the resulting pictures to be of excellent quality. So far I have not experienced any  nagging problems. I do find that uploading images is slow and I am  uploading to a Pentium III 450. Great fun with the software that came with  this camera! So far those I have taken pictures of and printed out using  the accompanying software were very impressed.,5,1,479
A6LXAPP89MLS6,1920,I bought Dazzles DVC about 2 years ago. In my opinion. it worked fine for capturing TV or videos to MPEG or VCD. However. at price about....remember. I bought it 2 years ago. and the price is still the same now.. you would expect it to do more than just capture MPEG1 videos. ATIs AllinWonder Radeon video card has far more functionalities than Dazzle DVC. and yet it cost less.you can find it online for about USD150 these days.. AllinWonder Radeon can capture not only MPEG1. but also MPEG2. Dazzles DVC II also captures MPEG2. but it has a price tag of...Plus. AllinWonder Radeon has a buildin TV tuner. so you dont have to attach an extra VCR for your computer to capture video. The only downside about AllinWonder Radeon is that it is also a video card. if your computer already has a highend video card .i.e. GeForce4. etc... you wouldnt want to replace your highend video card with this. If you dont own a highend video card. and are looking for a video capture device. I would suggest you to buy ATIs AllinWonder Radeon. and replace your current video card. because Radeons 3D performance is about the same with nVidias GeForce card. Itll cost less than Dazzles DVC. If you are looking for both a highend video card and video capture device. then get either Allinwonder Radeon 7500 or 8500. It got all the video capture functionality plus high performance 3D graphics chip. AllinWonder Radeon 8500... video cards 3D performance is equivalent to nVidias GeForce3 and AllinWonder Radeon 7500... performance falls in between Radeon and Radeon 8500. If after reading this review. you still want to buy Dazzles DVC. then take a look at the used listing for this product. Because Im selling my Dazzle DVC since I bought a AllinWonder Radeon. and the Dazzle DVC is still in very good condition.,3,0,1795
A6MD0AGOXLNAX,56,I am using these headphones with my CD player when I am at the gym. I wanted some that wouldnt get in the way and would stay in comfortably. I have tried the regular ear buds before but sometimes they would become akward or would shake a little loose after some time on a cardio machine. These earhuggers are soft around the ears and have an adjustable volume on the cord. Great for working out. If they last me for awhile after bring thwon in my gym bag over and over than they deserve the 5 stars!,4,1,499
A6MHD7SKZ1OJO,22,I think this is basically a good product. It is very sturdy for the money. My only beefs are that I found the instructions quite poor and lacking  in detail. I found the tilt and swivel adjustment more difficult than other reviewers. It requires you to loosen a bolt that is hard to get to. and it took me a while to figure out where it was because it was hidden under plastic covers in the arm. Because it is so sturdy and very affordable. I will probably buy another for my upstairs tv.,3,0,488
A6NRTAHP02GWG,1,Has a great button in the middle to turn it off when youre not around .great with cats and pets in this case..  Fits many of those big lunky plug ins.  LONG cord is a dream for where it can be placed.  You will not go wrong with this.  I have a phone. laptop and Ipad on it all at once and it does just what you want it to  not buzzing. feel safe and WORKS!,5,1,357
A6NS75DX1KHMJ,22,I discovered problems. but discovered working solutions to make this reader work great. Had to disable my antivirus program to install software. Cannot hotboot the media reader. but i leave it plugged in. I did discover i CAN hotswap the smartmedia cards and downloadcopy as long  as im not accessing the drives directly or have another program working  the drives too. Mine is a win95 machine. as quick as the files transfer. it  isnt a problem just waiting for it to finish before doing other tasks.,4,1,501
A6O6R9UCVVNH4,79,ive been playing with my c2000 zoom for about 3 weeks and have been happy with the results.  i had previously been using a toshiba pdrm1 and the olympus just blows it away.  the only gripe i have is that the lens cap  falls off if you forget to remove it before powering on.  the last time  this happened the cap fell into a ditch.  trying to find a replacement is  like trying to find the holy grail as the size of the cap is unique to this  model .41 mm i believe..  invest in a cap keeper for about 2 bucks.  battery life is fine as long as you minimize use of the lcd.  radio shack  sells a small NiMHNiCad recharger with 4 AA nickel MH batteries for  USD20...another worthwhile accessory.,4,1,693

A6R9EDUR6OJ1,0,I bought this rechargeable battery for my electric bass.  I go through batteries once every two weeks. so though rechargeable would be the way to go.  However. when I tried to insert the 9Volt battery into the rear of the bass...it wouldnt fit.  The battery is eversoslightly oddshaped.  I have no problem with standard alkaline Duracell and Panasonic 9Volts. but not this Energizer rechargeable.  I went to Radio Shack and bought one of their rechargeable 9Volts and it fits like it should.Please Energizer. consider using standard sizing in your manufacturing!  If it wasnt so inexpensive and problematic. I would have returned my purchase.,1,0,642
A6SL1MDD0JBAK,66,Good product.  The length of the cord is great and allows for the tablet to be plugged in a good distance from the wall.  The tablet seems to charge a little quicker.,4,1,166
A6T8FYQQO7L5F,0,For only USD300. this camera is an excellent choice for anyone who needs to take digital photographs.  It has more features than I ever thought possible. including the ability to slice a picture into 9 sections and zoom  in on each one .on the LCD screen.. and hook it up easily to a TV and use  the slide show function to display your photos on a larger  screen.Although the positives outway the negatives. there are still some  aspects I could do without.  I have had the camera for 2 days .and have  been using it very much as well.. and already the battery low warning has  appeared.  I read that you should really use the AC adapter for doing  camera u0026gt PC transfers. as well as connecting it to your TV.  I  havent done that. so Im sure those are 2 main reasons the batteries are  already low.Also. it is suggested that you use the LCD screen for  viewing pictures only. as not only does it eat up battery life but you can  take more steady pictures when using the viewer rather than the  LCD.Camera u0026gt PC transfers are slow and you can get quite impatient  waiting for the included software to indexthumbnail all the pics on the  cam before you can do anything such as download. etc.But. for the price  its an excellent camera.  You can save in .bmp. .jpg. and .tif using the  included software.  Using the lowest image quality mode. you can store  about 120 on the included 8 megabyte SmartMedia card. and they come out  exceptionally well. too.  4 flash features. zoom. and more make this camera  a necessity for the novice photographer or just about anyone.,4,1,1577
A6TK95DKOTVBI,88,I dont have a small head and yet. these wont stay on my head.  The band only adjusts so much and thats it.  Constantly have to keep putting them back in place.  A nuisance.  Lots of other headphones to choose from.  I would avoid these.,1,0,236
A6TU9CU9VJA0D,0,I bought this battery as a backup for my Sony HX5V for a trip to Europe last summer. I used this battery and the OEM battery extensively. and the Sony battery had a MUCH longer battery life. I could average over 400 pictures and a few short videos on the Sony battery. and only about 150200 pictures on this one. The GPS was engaged with both batteries. If you need a cheap. emergency backup battery. then this product will suffice. If you want a true replacement for the Sony. then just buy the OEM.,3,0,500

A6U5436V1BEAS,0,If you flip flip the iPad to use in right hand mode the camera function is lost as the lens no longer has an opening to shoot through. It would be ideal if the case strap secured the cover of the notepad when the iPad is being used and it might had the pad been designed for right handers. Lastly. one corner of the hard plastic that holds the iPad in place broke off as I was trying to remove it from the holder to flip it over into the less than ideal right hand configuration. This product may be one of the worst designed products of all time...unless you are left handed. Now I know what it feels like to live in their world.,1,0,630
A6U8B9DW3ALU5,0,You Know. some of you said that the sound quality of this system are poor. and your right. But. the looks of it and the price of it force me to give 3 Stars for this Ficher Slim 1500 System.The Bass is not so bad. but it can be better for a Ficher System. The remote control is very complete and some of the fonction. like the u0026quotSureWakeu0026quot are very helpful.,3,0,371

A6UP7VDJSW14V,0,I have not bought this product. but from the price range given here. it seems that this product will not fully convert the color systems when recording of the signal is engaged.This device was meant for playing video games with american ntsc color system on pal tv.This device will work with dvd players also.If you need to convert ntsc to pal or pal to ntsc for recording purpose. then buy something else.,2,0,406
A6W0PO0ZUKS5I,1112,Ive had my RCA DVD player for about 1 year now and have had no trouble at all.  I have noticed that it seems to get hot after a long while of use with the glass door shut. but that could just be all the other components  in the stack. I keep the door open now and it stays cool.  When I was  looking for a player. I was informed that RCA players had trouble reading  dual and quad layered discs.like Matrix.. but it has had no trouble..maybe  he just wanted to sell me one for a higher price? . I bought RCA partly  because my TV and VCR were both RCA. It is a great DVD player for the  money. All the other brands are very pricey and dont offer that many more  features. By the way. mine will not play CDR music discs...Just in case  you were wondering.,4,1,754
A6WM6KD9JO11U,88,I have been using a Kensington Orbit trackball for about five years. Ergonomically. its been an excellent experience. My hand rests comfortably on it. the motion feels smooth and even. and its helped me avoid the carpal tunnel symptoms I was getting from using my laptops trackpad. The Kensington MouseWorks software for Mac OS X .downloadable at no cost from their web site. allows me to adjust the speed and acceleration until the feel of the motion is just right.Some constructive criticism. while the software lets me set profiles for what the right and left buttons do in different applications. it would be great if I could also set up speed and acceleration profiles. For instance. I might want one kind of behavior when Im playing a game. another when Im word processing. yet another when Im editing an image in Photoshop. Perhaps the Windows version of the software has this capability  I can only comment on the Mac version. though.Many people complain about the performance of the Orbit being impacted because of the rollers gathering dirt and dust. This is quite true. If you use it with greasy fingers. its going to be a real problem  but even with normal. careful use. dust gets in there. Suddenly youll discover that the pointer is tracking in a choppy way. or will only move in one direction. You need to pop out the ball and clean the rollers. Its annoying and hard to find a good. effective way to do it without damaging the delicate mechanism inside. But it can be done  I did it for five years.Kensington as a company is excellent. They really stand by their product. Five years is an amazing warranty for a computer peripheral. and sure enough. the one time I broke the mechanism while cleaning my Orbit they sent me a new unit without any hassle. Theyve earned my loyalty as a customer.Last month. as I cleaned the rollers on my 3year old Orbit. the rubbery material started flaking off. I guess I was scraping the dirt off too vigorously. It just didnt work well after that. This time. instead of using the warranty. I decided to upgrade to the Kensington Orbit optical version. No mechanical rollers to worry about. Still. the original Orbit trackball lasted long and was a pleasure to use. If you dont mind the occasional cleaning. and you dont drop crumbs and handle with greasy fingers. you should get a good long use out of it!,4,1,2355

At the time memory was very expensive but now buy all you can get.  I like bigger is better concept especially while on an extended vacation in other countries when you do not want to have to download photos to make room for more.I have recently bought 32 MB for a pair of Nextbooks and the same for my Galaxy phone.

A72A8JDQK4D8S,0,I ordered this 50 cable.  I was sent a 25 cable instead.  Now I have to return the cable. and due to their S_L_O_W return processing times I wont have the 50 cable I ordered by May 10th when I travel to another state where it will be installed over the weekend.  Its obvious to me Amazon doesnt check orders with package labeling to ensure the item being shipped matches the item that was ordered.  Order CLEARLY states 50 foot.  Package CLEARLY states 25 and that was obvious to me as soon as I opened the box.  Should have been obvious to Amazon before they closed the box to send it.,1,0,586

A744QP0BNPO5K,0,If you are considering a regular Canon Elph. go with the 370Z instead. its powerful zooming capability is well worth the extra.  For such a small. lightweight camera. its picture clarity is remarkable .even when you enlarge the prints..  I took it as my only camera on a trip to Europe. and ended up with photos that compared favorably to professional postcards.  Ive had this camera for a year and havent regretted it for a moment.  I keep it in my purse for all those moments when people say. u0026quotI wish we had a camera with us!u0026quot  If you are new to APS cameras. you will love the easy system of index prints and not having to handle negatives.  The handiest camera Ive ever owned.,5,1,695
A74HK3XXFGZ9G,1516,I should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product.  Handhelds. including this one. are pretty useless without an external antenna.  Perhaps it was defective. but this one wouldnt even pick up a broadcast 50 in front of my truck.  Nonetheless. this would be a great value if it worked.  It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments.,2,0,368
A75J6R85KNBYN,26,Best price. as offered and received sooner than promised. Card works great and is just what I needed. than you,5,0,110
A76KQUCK0PEXT,0,Maybe Im just used to much faster devices. but this is slow and cumbersome to deal with. It lost items that I had downloaded into it. and when you change the font size. the pages no longer reflect the true page numbers.,2,0,219
A76QA8ID3NTCC,0,I never write product reviews. but this thing is so awful. the customer service so bad. I made an exception. I wasted three entire days on the phone .my Christmas holiday. with customer service in some foreign country and they never could get the Wifi running. They had no clue. None of them. All they wanted to do was get off the phone with me so they could NOT help someone else. They kept telling me to take the Nook to the nearest store. which was two hours away. So I took it to the Bu0026N store and they said. yeah. we get a lot of that. Needless to say. they couldnt help me. I couldnt get my money back either. Just four Gift Cards. Do Not Buy A Nook. Buy a Kindle instead.,1,0,682
A778X9CUE16YO,710,have not gotten it mounted yet so only time will tell if it is a good product.  Purchased it for my brother who decided not to use it and am now going to have it mounted in my living room.,4,1,188
A77S0PYN1IWC9,0,Although this product got good reviews it definitely has not worked for me. Everytime I go to plug this in it turns off my computer. If it randomly doesnt turn off my computer it still wont play the DVD. I would say it works 110 times but I no longer use it because Im afraid it will erase my hard drive or something similar to my laptop. Also. why does it come with 2 cords?,1,0,375
A788NZEETL3P5,0,I bought this because it was the cheapest 10 foot cable of this type. Being that it was so cheap I was not surprised when it didnt work. I looked closely at the mini hdmi and the pins were bent. I had to straighten them out. then it worked alright.,2,0,248
A792B9WSCH7J3,13,This little DVD player is amazing.  As a frequent traveller I use this while waiting for planes. on the plane .yes it is allowed on ALL US based airlines after the flight reaches 10.000 feet.. and hook it up to the TV  set in my hotel room. The sound quality. as mentioned by others. isnt  great through the speakers. but its not bad for the 2 small speakers. the  sound is MUCH better using headphones. somehow the surround sound even  seems to work through headphones.  The little u0026quotjoysticku0026quot for the  menu is a little hard to use. but it just may be my big fingers. the remote  is great.  I would recommend this for anyone who does a lot of travelling.  or who is taking a long drive with kids. show them a movie and the trip may  just be a little more enjoyable!,5,1,781
A79SY7WQ8SZLM,7782,This player has major problems with certain disks.  It cant even begin to play John Carpenters Vampires. u0026quotThe Matrixu0026quot .dual layer disk. gets about half way through. then only plays every other chapter.  The  players computer software.firmware. loses its mind all too often even on  disks it has previously played causing the u0026quotincompatible disk  messageu0026quot which requires resetting the player by unplugging it.  If you  play back movies using the Dolby Digital sound setting you get periodic  pops in the soundtrack and times when the sound goes away for a few  seconds.  I have to say overall it has been a very pathetic DVD player thus  proving once again that u0026quotyou get what you payu0026quot.  If you have one  of these players and think its great. just wait over time with more movies  played you will change your mind!,1,0,859
A7A01Y50214JY,2026,Well. I had read all the reviews of this model on Amazon and based my purchasing decision partly on this information.  I expected picture quality from the 310 to be at least as good as my old PAL Sony 8mm.  However. after  2 weeks of using the 310 we had to conclude that it simply provides  inferior picture quality in most lighting situations.  Inferior in both  colour reproduction and in clarity. whatever the technical specs. say. For  example. I have a coat with a maroon sleeve but this appeared bright red  whatever exposure or program setting I used same with the shop model we  checked with when returning the purchased unit to the store  it didnt  appear to be just a snafu with the particular unit we had purchased.  We  also compared the 310 picture with the supposedly inferior Panasonic 910  and both colour and clarity were actually better on the latter.  Why?  What is Sony playing at?  We were expecting twice the clarity  .u0026quotresolutionu0026quot. and 3 times the colour depth from this Digital 8  camera. as widely advertised.  What are they talking about?  When it comes  down  to it. its about picture quality. no matter what bells and whistles  the machine has.Boy. was I glad to get my money back!,2,0,1226
A7BSTC5OXHCLZ,8089,The trackball was advertised as PS2 or USB.  It turned out to be a Serial Port PS2 and would not function with my equipment without special software which could not be loaded.  I sent it back. no problems. and ordered a Kensington trackball from Walmart online which was advertised PS2 or USB.  It has worked perfectly with no software necessary. just plug and use.  No fault of the trackball or the manufacturer.,2,0,413

A7FVB1BCX9AC9,0,On my modern windoz pc. these did not make it possible to use an old ps2 mouse as I had hoped. No reason to think it defective  another adapter failed as well  this is apparently due to an incompatibility between the mouse and the pc.,2,0,234
A7GQR8Z6YYU38,1,I have a HP mini and was in need of a cddvd drive. and because I did not want to purchase or trade in for a new computer I seached for a external drive. This product already has great reviews and compared to others I came across it is more compatible and affordable. It arrived early in a secure package. no instructions. no lable. just the product and cords needed. Which is understandable because its self explanatory you just plug in the USB cords and your computer should automativally read it. However. if you have Windows 7 you will need to download a media player.,4,1,571
A7I4CRUYLIHA0,22,Just received this player for Christmas.  Marvellous!  Page 7 of the manual. though. says you cant connect the player to a TV which does not have a video input connector.  I have an old Sony 13u0026quot Trinitron with  an antenna connection only.  Nothing in the manual gives any guidance as to  how to hook this up.  Theres nothing about accessories.  Amazons DVD  buying guide doesnt mention this issue in the section on video hookups.  Someone asks about it on the Amazon discussion board. and theres an  incomplete answer about needing an adapter.  What one?  How much does it  cost?  So after looking all over on Amazon for 2+ hours. I guess Ill just  call the electronics store....And Sonys remote doesnt include a TV  mute button.  No button for muting!  Other than omitting these basics. Im  sure the machine will be firstrate. whenever I figure out how to connect  it....,4,1,880
A7IA2N978EDZ5,929,Do NOT try to use it with a phone that supports one than one line though. It will cut off the call you are on everytime someone rings in. Otherwise wonderful for a desk top unit.,3,0,178
A7IHPCM87A2M4,0,I use the Spreed Conference Speaker Microphone with Skype and Webex via the USB port and it works terrific.  Sound quality for both the speaker and microphone is very good.  The microphone seems to pickup voices very well from anyone within the room.  I highly recommend this product for hands free conference calls.,5,1,316
A7JCA80LQF0M4,55,Total waste of money.  Instead of charging my Garmin. it made it cycle. thereby totally discharging the battery.  After that. my Garmin wouldnt work at all. After I hooked it up to my computer for a while. the battery charged enough for me to see that the Garmin wasnt destroyed after all.  This is the same charger that is also advertised for the Garmin 260W. as well as the 1490LTM  I wouldnt use it on either one.  I am at a loss as to why this is being sold on Amazon at all. since it never seems to work. according to the reviews Ive read belatedly   and its offered by numerous sellers.Definitely worth the price to purchase the authentic Garmin charger. if you feel you need one.  Suggest just charging the battery using your computer instead.,1,0,750
A7JJB8BM4GMDS,11,The hard case for Palm V offers good protection while on the move. But during operation it is a nuisance. The contrast switch on top of the Palm is depressed by the hard case making it impossible to operate my Palm when  it is resting in the hard case. overall handling is harder. HotSync is a  joke and finally the looks does not at all reach the finish of the Palm V  itself. Where the Palm V is well thought out and well designed. the hard  case is clearly an afterthought. Buy the hard case only for travel  protection  personally I would not buy it again.,2,0,560
A7JSD1S8PSINN,2121,Even in the age of DVRs and Tivo some of us still use VHS to record our programs. This tape although still produced is hard to find in stores but Amazon supplies it. For years Maxell has been the best VHS tape and even though their product line has gotten smaller their High Grade line .formally HGXGold. are simply the best out there. Awesome picture quality that will look better than the original broadcast. Still use a monoral VCR? No problem. Sound Quality in SLP mode is marvelous .which is what I use because I want the maximum amount of recording time.. I recommend the 8 hour length  because of the extra two hours of recording time. I used to use TDK 8hour HiFi or Extra High Grade tapes but TDK has stopped producing good tapes at long lengths so I moved to Maxell which is more than satisfactory. If you cant find these in stores buy them here.,5,1,856
A7K0YMHNEJNBJ,3031,Bought one right after they came out. I love the idea of a simple. cheap.er.. E ink. midsize book reader and it seemed to fit the bill as I tried it out. After using it for a few months. I realize that its not yet the device I was hoping for.Good. My setup was pretty simple Nice form factor Battery life Book display looks goodBad. Instore help was not that great. My nook was one that broke a few months after light use. so I took it back to the store. The thing was completely broken. but it still took 1 12 hours. At the end of this time. with the instore employee having to talk to several different people on the phone for approval and getting ideas for possible fixes and being confused by those fixes. they finally said that I could send it in and get a new one in a few weeks. That was odd because they had just told another customer that instore help was so much better than working with Amazon. After another phone call and manager approval. who also felt it important to play with the device. I did finally walk out with a new one. Holding the device is strange for me. I cant get a comfortable grip that also works for turning the pages. Not sure if this is the size or the fact that I have to be careful not to touch the screen the whole time Im reading. I just know that there is a subtle feeling that holding a real book feels better than this device. Cover looks good. but only hooks in on one side. even though the device has places on both sides where it could connect. Not sure why they did this. but the problem it causes is that when you use the buttons on the left to turn pages. the right comes up off the back an inch or so. This means the thing flaps every time you turn the page this way. Syncing to the latest page read does not work between NOOK for PC and the reader. When I emailed them. they gave a generic response that they are working on it and to check back with their website. which already said that it was supposed to work. Gave up on getting library ebooks after installing a couple of applications on my computer. several emails to libraries. and discussions with others that got it working. but said it was a pain. Could be a problem just with my area. Free books I tried are terrible. I had a hard time finding a decent one .the one I got  through google books were unreadable.. so paid for a cheap version. which still had problems. Physical page turning using the buttons on the left and right of the device is strange. The buttons require you to either press in just the right place. or press too hard. so there is always a pause to see if it did turn. or if I should hit it again. The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. Bu0026N battle since the books Im buying may not work on the devices of the future. and for the short term. they definitely will not work. For example. I was considering the Fire. but know that the dozen books I bought so far for the Nook will not transfer over easily if I do.Overall I like it. but hopefully the next version. or the next Kindle. will solve some of these problems. And please. Amazon and Bu0026N. work hard on making sure that ebooks are device agnostic in the future.,3,0,3180
A7LMUSGRFK6F5,0,This is a 1.3 Mpix camera and is an excellent camera for this category.  It takes great pictures up to 4 X 6.  I have even printed out 8 X 10 that are very good.  Upon close scrutiny you would notice pixels at that resolution but that would be true for any camera of this calibre.  If you have a laptop and an adapter card for the memory card then downloading pictures is a breeze.  No Kodak software is even needed.  I do find the Kodak software useful for simple cropping and printing of pictures as well as slide show presentation.  It is slow to upload using serial port on a desktop and well worth buying an adapter that accepts compactflash cards.  I have taken thousands of pictures with the camera and feel it is well worth it for the category of camera it is.,4,1,768
A7M65S692BTZI,33,I bought this case a long time ago. I used to have bigger notebooks than today. Nevertheless. great product. well made. durable and comfortable.,3,0,144
A7MKO11ZX97G4,0,I bought this to replace my old sony tape adapter Ive had since the Discman days. That one worked great until my car .Acura TL. decided to start doing the autoreverse deal and constantly spit it out. Being the cheapo that I am. I wanted to find another tape adapter instead of getting an audio input installed in my car. and I was hopeful when I saw the reviews on this adapter. However. this product constantly clicks. and loud enough to distract me from the music playing. Also the quality on this adapter is much worse than my 15year old sony adapter. Theres a lot of white noise. and I have to crank up the volume on both my ipod and my car speakers to get it to a volume where I can actually hear the lyrics of the songs.  Ive tried fiddling with the wire. moving it in different positions. and pulling the wire straight. but it doesnt help. Ive rendered the adapter pretty much useless. and for now am stuck listening to the radio until I decide to suck it up and stop being cheap about installing an audio jack in my car.,1,0,1028

A7NT2POY2DS06,0,I recently bought my first Windows phone. I love my music. so I wanted more storage. The Professional Ultra SanDisk 16GB card worked perfectly.  No problems at all and for a good price.,5,0,185
A7NX65ZU9KDDJ,22,the thing that really makes me like this product is the exposed back. the only reason i wanted a case is for the screen protection. i love the design of the nook but the screen feels a bit exposed for me. this is the perfect option for those who want to show off the lovely design of the nook but dont wanna hide it in a leather case. although i should point out that one of the advantages of having a full leather case was to disguise my ereader as a book. i had a sony ereader and the leather case made it look like an ordinary planner. besides that i really love this cover. the front cover is really well designed. the interior part of the cover is some soft touch leather that feels great to touch. especially when you have it bent back to hold in one hand. the exterior is leather and theres a neat little design on the bottom right corner where they have a blue tab that stick out slightly. it makes it look like a bookmark. anyways its aesthetically pleasing to me and i hope others can appreciate in the same way. the light is bright and very useful. but when not in use it hides well in the portion that attaches to your nook. it comes with 2 AAA batteries. i havent had my case long so i cant say how long those batteries last me but when it does ill post an update.,5,1,1277
A7OR8OWWGK55W,22,Works ok. Not worth the price tag new. I purchased refurb for half the price of new. Sounds is not CD quality. Sound is similar to FM radio as the device broadcasts over a FM signal. I live in a condo and placed 1 speaker in each bedroom and hooked the unit up to my stereo in the living room. Now I can listen to my Comcast Music Choice and CDs thru out my home.,2,0,363
A7OT82DN460H2,68,The one from the seller was crap. however that was resolved. I still had to purchase one for class and it was far more expensive than necessary. This has the equivalent of USD1 production costs and USD25+ extra charges.,1,0,219
A7RU8PR3WBUSX,1,This eReader is a total crap! You cant view detailed images and charts in it as it doesnt have a zoom functionality! this limits its use to just puretext ebooks. This issue has been raised ever since its released and yet Bu0026N has never released an update to make the functionality available.I really regret buying it. no wonder people are trying to sell them off preowned. Buy a Kobo mini instead. at nearly the same price it has all the basic functionality you would need from an eReader.,1,0,492

A7SUYY0AO8Z4Z,22,I like to carry a camera everywhere I go. In the past Ive carried cheap pointandshoots that took HORRIBLE pictures. The ELPH Jr. is the first Pu0026ampS Ive come across that I can wear on my belt and have reasonable  confidence that the pictures I take with it will be of acceptable quality.  The only thing I really dont like about it is the APS format. .Which  ironically is the thing that allows it to be so small..

A7TII11WWPNZB,11,I have in the past bought inexpensive chargers for various devices. all worked as promised. This one however did not charge my Garmin Nuvi 1450 at all. in fact it discharged what power was left in it. My Garmin constantly thought it was being hooked up to my laptop for updating. and cycled through these various screens over and over. I left it plugged in for over two hours. The gps had considerably less power than when I began to charge it. I suppose the lesson here is to believe the reviews and consider a higher priced wall charger.,1,0,539

A7V9WIUIB02OI,22,Good. strong mount and quality hardware. Includes all the different size screws required to attach to TV if yours doesnt have them .or if you lost them..  There is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around.  I mounted a shelf above the TV to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long HDMI cable through the wall.I took a star only because I received a different unit than the one pictured. It has 2 thick arms. rather than the 21 that is shown.  Honestly I think what I got is more attractive. but I believe that Amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization.  My unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture. it has a mounting plate with all of the VESA mounting holes in the correct configuration.  My TV is 26  so it fit perfectly.  I am sure my 55  would fit on it too. but I have a different mounting configuration for that one.,4,1,974

A7Y3926EVNPWN,55,Sweet sub that rocks any movie.  If you need a little more bass for your home theater this sub is perfect.  Most people with home theaters that are upgrading from pro logic to dolby digital have little tiny surround  speakers.  This is a great idea to balance out the sound during those  action packed thrillers like the Matrix or Saving Private Ryan.  If youre  after more boom. like for music only systems. then you might want something  bigger. but for home theaters this is perfect.  Its a good size. about the  size of a milk crate. it was easy to hide next to my couch.  This thing  gets real loud. if its not against a wall the sound is a little sloppy.  Volume. xover. phase. and auto on. switches are all on back.  Hi and low  level inputs are there too.  This will work with any system.  Bottom line.  For a hundred bucks. you cant beat this deal.,4,1,857
A7Y6AVS576M03,55,They are getting harder to find but I still love to comparison shop this stuff. I still make it a point to check out VCRs and the like whenever I get a chance to get out to an electronics store. The quality and dependability of SONYs VCRs unfortunately fluctuates exasperatingly. SONY made some very good VCRs in the past. SONYs SLV679HF VCR demonstrates a genuine effort to return to the type of quality product they were once known for with some good features.My daughters roommate owns one of these units as it so happens and this unit makes very good recordings. Prerecorded tapes look excellent as well. What really impressed me was the playback image of EP recordings. I observed that black u0026 white movies recorded in EP look better than those recorded in SP. which is a little hard to explain. but others agreed on that point. I have found this true of all the recent SONY VCRs that I have seen on the market since 2002.Unfortunately. I could not find many of these units on the shelf anymore. They were out there once I suppose and then they seem to have vanished. This VCR. the one I saw. really impressed me.,4,1,1122
A7Y6AVS576M03,1919,I have always used wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes since I can remember. Generally if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems. In fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads. Most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play prerecorded budget tapes in your VCR. You may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture. sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads. linear audio heads. rollers and guides. In these instances wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me. These cleaners really do work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your own.,5,1,804

A83N14T7FQV82,2,The wireless modemphone jack idea is a great one. but it rarely works the way it is intended.  Whether its interference from other electronics. old house wiring. or any number of things. it tends to have a poor signal resulting in a bad connection.  If youre using this for either a modem. security system that requires a phone line. or a telephone jack. its likely not going to give you the results you want.  My recommendation would be to go ahead and have a phone drop and jack installed and call it a day.  It may be a more expensive option. but its by far the best one.,2,0,574
A83WE5X94IY8B,0,Im still not really sure how it works but it really does fade from ND2 to ND400 with a simple turn of the filter. Saves having to carry around a bunch of different filters AND having to change them up to get just the right affect. Great little product!,4,1,252
A8490PK0EUBB3,0,I had. and resolved. an odd issue which I just wanted to share for anyone who might be considering this cable.I bought this to work with a Roku XD. The Roku would not connect to the wireless networkI got the standard cant connect message. I moved my router. changed the position of the Roku. tried different security settings. all to no avail. Sat on hold and talked with Roku tech support and Sisco tech support. without success.I swapped this HDMI cable for a different one on a whim. and instantly connected. Somehow this cable was scrambling or interfering with the wireless signal.So. if youre going to use this with a wireless device. maybe reconsider.That said. the picture was fine and the cable is inexpensive. What more do you want? I would just recommend against using it with anything wireless.,2,0,806
A84O215CIZY6W,78,I was the biggest nookkindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook. I would constantly diss the ereaders claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the booksprint was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom .u0026lt3!!. gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasnt cheap to download the books. but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me .which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore. but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long its insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer .hey. I had to finish the series before school resumed!. and I only had to charge it once a week tops. even then the battery wasnt drained I just didnt want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now its insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little. lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DONT FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you havent read yet.Also. when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook .or any ereader in general. enough. You can still buy physical books .I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them. but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.Even though my first nook was free .making it that much sweeter.. I would gladly lay down USD100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model. not the color though. thats more like a tablet PC than an ereader.,5,1,1928
A84P2QF6L57YX,44,I got this model MD as a present last Christmas and I love it for many reasons.  1.. It is sturdy yet compact.  The newer models I have seen dont seem as durable as this model.  2.. I can make my own u0026quotmix tapesu0026quot thousands of times over because MDs are rerecordable without losing audio quality.  Also I can take my favorite songs from CDs and put them on one disc instead of lugging around several CDs.  3.. I can record from any audio source.  Download from the internet and make your own MD without investing in blank CDs.  4.. The batteries last forever. or seemingly forever.  I listen on long road trips .8 hours +. and seldom need lots of extra batteries.  5.. Its so easy to use that I am able to use it.  6.. I have never had any problems with it.  I have even dropped it on the ground .accidentally. a few times and nothing has been damaged on the inside. or outside  7.. Its less bulky than a portable CD player.There are a million great reasons to buy an MD player. of which the above are only a few.  I dnt understand why more people dont own these.,5,1,1077
A850S0PK7OMFU,1314,Been using this stuff for a couple years.  Works great for me. I use it different than the instruction.  Find a flat surface. lay a bundle of tissue on it. place the disk scratched face up.  Place a couple drops of 1 abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward .you dont have to wait 5 minutes..  Keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry .about 5 minutes..  Spray once with 2. and using a clean TISSUE. continue wiping VERY GENTLY radially outward until 2 dries.  Try the disk.  If it doesnt work. repeat all the above until it does.  This really does work. but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches.  Ive had a LOT of scratched disks. and I havent found one yet that I couldnt fix with this.,5,1,811
A8540ROXP4VOI,2627,First. a few points of clarification that werent available online when I ordered this recorder.1. u0026quotMiniu0026quot refers to the size of the appliance itself. not to the cassettes it accepts.  This recorder uses  standard audio cassettes.2. The unit runs on 2 AA batteries. which .as  you might expect. are not included in the package. but which you can also  order from Amazon.com if you like.3. The package does not include  headphones. but the unit does have a builtin speaker that works passably  if youre listening in a lownoise environment.As for evaluation. if  youre looking for a way to make highquality recordings. youre going to  have to spend more than USD20 on your equipment.  This unit will provide  adequately discernable dictationespecially when listening through  headphonesbut isnt great for recording music or filtering background  noise.u0026quotPlusesu0026quot include a variablespeed playback option that  allows you to review a recording at fasterthannormal speeds .handy if  youre listening to get the u0026quotgistu0026quot of a lecture. or trying to  locate a particular point.. and a u0026quothilou0026quot microphone switch.  which according to the documentation switches between longrange .e.g.  lecture. and shortrange .e.g. dictation. recording even through  headphones. though. I found that this switch makes very little difference  in recordings.One complaint is that the placement of the control buttons  .play. record. rewind. fast forward. stop. is a little awkward for my  fingers.  This is probably a symptom of the u0026quotminiu0026quot size. although  Ive used other units that werent quite as challenging.All in all. Id  recommend this unit as a good buy for customers looking for goodquality  dication on standard audio cassettes.  Just dont expect any miracles from  this unit.,4,1,1828
A85GE3EXACRKW,5959,I bought this walkman and didnt expect such a great performance from such a cheap walkman. Great sound. slim as an audio cassette. If youre looking for a great deal. this is it!,4,0,177
A85PGE2FRU7J8,44,Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He didnt think he would use an ereader.  The Nook is so easy to set up and use.  I have one too and we both read with them all the time.,5,0,175
A85QY94NU4RQ4,0,Do NOT buy this DVD! The video quality is awful it looks as if it was made from a VHS tape . . . and with the exception of the opening sequence. its in the 4.3 format.I wish I hadnt given my Laser Disc player. and Laser Disc of this movie. to the thrift shop!,1,0,259
A86MSAYP2XWRF,11,Dont even bother purchasing this. I tried over ten times to get this to work. Finally. broke down and manually cleaned my VHS .which I really didnt want to do. and now have great picture.,1,0,187
A86Y6S1KJRCM4,33,Rechargeable battery .and the charger DOES come with it.. 40second buffer .unfortunately. I still have to carry in my hand when jogging.. no need for recording capability .so price very attractive compared to Sonys Id seen. were reasons for my choice .to replace Sony MZE40..  Have found the  overall product well contructed. handy. and with superb minidisc sound.  I  do not use the control panel... all the controls I need are on the unit  itself.  Nor do I anticipate using the AA battery adaptor.  As to  replacement rechargeable batteries. JVC says partssupplies available.  I believe them.  Excellent first experience with Amazon.,4,1,636
A88ECDA3K25FN,3235,This is the perfect product if you are into DVD movie collection.  What I have done is this. seperated my movies by actorgenre.  All my disney movies go into one. action into another. horror into yet another. Mel  Gibson into one. Sean Connery into another. and so on.  The possibilities  are endless.  This coupled with its big brother .aka the 20 disc holder.  also save tremendous amounts of space.  Just put the movie cover into the  slot on the front of a page. the movie in the back. then throw the jewel  case away.  Very simple.  This case also protects the disc from scratching  and dust. but it is also very presentable and will look distinguished on  even the fanciest of entertainment centers.  Plus. your movies are now very  ready for travel. Enjoy!,5,1,763
A89S4CAUALRFF,1516,The camera itself works quite well with focus up to one foot from the object. The software that comes with unit is lacking. Even Microsofts NetMeeting is more feature rich than what comes bundled. USB bandwidth is  acceptable unless you use other high bandwidth devices like scanners or  media drives during live video. Plan on scaling your frames and rate down  if are multitasking. The hardware installed on all flavors of Microsoft  Windows 95 and 98 and also worked on beta versions of upcoming Microsoft  operating systems. You will not find this product on IBMs site. it is  OEMed from another vendor. The same essential camera was offered to new  subscribers of Earthlink but was the serial port version. This one suffered  due to serial port bandwidth limitations.,3,0,772
A8AOI70PT1R1B,5154,These cleaners do occasionally work. but most likely youll need to clean it by hand. That said. do this......Its likely cheaper and you dont have to wait for it to arrive!,1,0,171
A8AUNKYWU4773,11,I bought this for my husband. since he phone was so full of music hed run out of memory.  This did nothing to help that.  Since he installed it. not only has it not provided more memory.  Whenever you try to save something to the memory card instead of the phone it says you have to connect to USB.  Not satisfied at all.,1,0,321
A8BGFC6VK46OW,0,The only positive thing I can say about this tripod is that it is very light and very cheap. I tried to use it several times   does its job only if the camera is positioned right on top .90 degrees.. If you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight. I was using canon powershot S3 IS. which is really light. I cant imagine if you use it with a dslr camera. My final conclusion  It is good if you dont need to change the vertical position of the camera.,2,0,506
A8BWB7IGWOH6E,0,I thought that this case was perfect.If you are someone who travels and hates having things scattered every where than you need one of these. The only complaint I had was that it only holds 6 minidiscs. I would like at  least 10. Overall it was a great product!,5,1,261
A8CMHJ1B4P9FJ,45,Bought it for my 7 yr old son who is starting keyboard piano lessons. . Fits his ears snug u0026 he seems to like it. Ive noticed the sound seems to distort a bit when hearing from the headphones.,3,0,196
A8F2AZWB20X1H,0,I am the Original Computer Dummy and wouldnt know WiFi from hifi.  I also resisted getting an ereader for years.  I like to turn pages when I read.  However. I played around with this ereader at the Barnes u0026 Noble counter and was instantaneously and totally hooked.  It is an absolute pleasure to use.  The images on the screen are clear and crisp and the adjustable font makes it easy on anyones eyes.  The color is glorious.  I liked the social connect to Facebook and found web surfing no problem at all.  The one drawback is that the Nook Color doesnt come with 3G yet so if youre not at a WiFi hotspot surfing will have to wait until you find one.Setup was very easy the directions are all on screen.  You have to charge it up before you start using it and this will take about three hours.  After charging it up you have to register your Nook Color before you can begin using it. and if you dont have WiFi at home youll have to take it to a Barnes u0026 Noble or any other hotspot to complete the process.  Once thats done. youre off and running and can start downloading books. magazines. or whatever.The magazine selection is somewhat limited at this point although I understand more will become available.  But as far as books are concerned. the skys the limit.  I was able to download books I never thought would be available.  And the prices are unbelievable.  The complete Jane Austen .all six books plus some extras. is available for 99 cents.  Most other books run between USD3.00 and USD10.00. and I was able to find a few freebies that didnt cost a dime.I love my Nook Color.  Its becoming a part of me.Judy Lind,5,1,1632
A8F3XK1F0LQQG,2426,it sucks and its slow,1,0,21
A8F89LPDHY6G1,1,This product was fairly cheap but it does not do a very good job holding together. If you need a strong velcro this is not the one.,3,0,131
A8FMH99F4393G,0,My intent in purchasing this headset was to better utilize Dialpad.coms new internet telephone service.I had a cheap .USD9.95. headset that I had used with voice recognition software and it was fine for that. but when I tried using them with Dialpad.com. the person I called would hear what they  previously said 2 or 3 seconds after they said it... just as clearly as  they would hear me.So. when I tried this new. more expensive headset...  I expected a minimal u0026quotechou0026quot effect.The net performance is  that the more expensive headset has not performed any better than the  inexpensive. generic type.If you choose these headsets. keep the packing  material. You may want to return them.,1,0,701
A8GT4H8U17KD7,3552,i think it not good. The machine was taken apart. Because there is some crack in it. I dont like it.,2,0,100
A8H5DO5JK3Y2C,2,I bought my Nino in December at an incredible price. two monthslater I can say that this machine is great. I use everywhere. inmeetings. courses. in my office. etc.  Before my purchase I studiedall my options. a Palm was a good one but the Window CE is better than the Palm OS.All that I need is in my hand,4,1,306
A8IF4ZBZRY86C,33,i was looking for a power strip that has sufficient cord the plug doesnt stick out too far and would look stylish on the floor at a reasonable price withof course a surge protecter its going to go behind an armoire that will cover the only outlet that i use for my vacuum. this was perfect.,4,1,290
A8J3U2SKD8FDJ,24,For under USD50.00. you get an awesome sounding system thatll beat most other speakers twice the price!  After plugging them in. I couldnt believe the sound!  The only problems I encountered were as you move around the  room. the bass levels seem to fluctuate  the separate volume control is  not ergonomically friendly  should be built into one of the satellites.  Overall. for the price. theyre a GREAT value!,5,1,411
A8J9IM48PGLQO,55,Lapel is lightweight and build seems fair.  Clip seems fairly durable and rotates.  I do not get very fast response time or clear voices through these or the Motorola 90 dollar walkie talkies I bought.  Not real happy with Motorola radios or lapels.  Perhaps going south like the Blackberry did....,3,0,298
A8JLIZ8ORW85M,0,I received my Barnes u0026 Noble Nook Tablet for Christmas last year .2011. and my husband received the Kindle HD. I use mine just about daily. I read emails on it. read books. watch Netflix while on the treadmill its amazing to have. Ive had a lot of issues with the HULU app. Ive had issues where if it times out while Im on a page and turns off. Ill try to turn it back on and the page I was reading is not visible. Meaning the page before and after is so I have to go out of the book open another book close that then reopen the book I was reading and magically my page reappears. Now. less than a year later the power cord stopped charging my nook. It looks like its charging but it is not. Yesterday. I call customer service. and they were helpful until they sent me to some barely English speaking person to help me. I supposedly fall under warranty. they wouldnt help me until I was able to plug the device into a USB port I didnt have one available to me. So after 15 minutes I had absolutely no luck. Today after another 13 minute conversation with someone else who because of the language barrier thought I was asking him to reset my password instead of send me another usb cord.?????. he told me that I should call back in 5 days because theyre out of stock on cables. I may get it in the mail though. but in 5 days if I dont. call back and check on it. I got no confirmation number. no confirmation email. nothing. I mentioned that I do use this thing daily. Well now I cant for possibly 5+ days and Im not super excited about it. I should mention my husbands kindle has the same capabilities as my Nook. and hes not had any problems whatsoever with it.For me to use it daily. means that I really enjoy being able to read a book. read my email. watch a show. but I probably would choose Kindle over Nook. theres really no advantage having the NOOk instead of the Kindle.,4,1,1883
A8JSYZTR5D1VW,0,This cd player is ok...but the case breaks very easily...A tiny little basketball hit it and the case broke. but it still plays...I guess I will have to fix it some how...I suggest you invest 20 more dollars in a sony cd  player. those thing last longer...KOSS should stick to making head  phones...,1,0,299
A8L37C5ABVJDY,0,After reading some of the negative reviews about this card. it is very clear that those running XP are giving up on this card WAY TO EARLY and just are frustrated. I have a P41800 and this card didnt want to work with XP at first. and XP will do its best to try to not allow you to install it. The trick is to keep plugging away and then downloading the XP drivers for this card from the ATI website.Installation is a bit hectic. and those with no patience could become frustrated because Microsoft has not yet digitially tested this product for XP. But I assure you it works fine and works very well.,4,1,601
A8L8U91R992XJ,22,There were needed in my computerTV setup.  They arrived on time.  And they seem sturdy and well made.  Note that they are a full 7Feet long.,4,1,140
A8LX0PN6LAH2S,0,It wouldnt run. Just snow on the screen. Couldnt rewind it. because it didnt go forward at all.  Went back to using my old one that has reached almost 100 cleanings. I was very disappointed. Wont buy another one.,1,0,212
A8N0LDIO7TDCO,0,I have bought two of these. and they both broke within six months. The lock is poorly made. and isnt secure.,2,0,108
A8NOWNJBEKN8F,0,i got it broken but fixed it a week later an also had to replace the charger it wasnt puting any charge out .other then that it was sent on time scratch free very well clean besides the power not working,3,0,203
A8P1VFCDZ8UTJ,0,Got these because I occasionally wanted to listen to music without earphones at my desk and wanted something that would sound good when cranked up.  I was not disapointed. the speakers sound very nice and the subwoofer .which is pretty large. but easily shoves away under the desk. really puts out a lot of base. .so much so that my neighbor complained and I had to turn the sub down a bit even though the music was relatively soft..The earphone plug on the right speaker is very convenient. and the volume and power switches allow the volume to be adjusted or turned off.  The speakers automatically mute when you plug your earphones in as well.Probably my only negative comment would be that the connectors from the sub to the sattellites are somewhat odd. one is a standard RCA and the other is PS2 style cable like you see on mice.  I guess the advantage is that its easier for people to plug in because they cant get the right and left speakers confused. but I would have preferred standard RCA or miniplugs on both so that I could possibly use other sattellites if these broke.Overall these are great speakers....,5,1,1119
A8PW0WUVGYF9P,2021,The concept and the quality of the product leads me to believe it will work. when needed. It is easy to use. with part wrapped around a stationary object. and the other end entrenched in the computer. Someone trying to steal the computer will break the case if the cable is attached. The cable appears to be heavy duty. and a large pair of nippers would be needed to cut it.,4,1,374
A8Q1L6NGVHBXX,1,This is less expensive than at cell phone dealers.  Seems to work well.  Saves hassle of loosing info when you upgrade phone.,5,0,125
A8QAAVV1R3SD6,33,Thinking this was similar to the Motorola walkie talkies I purchased two of them. but was disappointed and am returning them.  No way the range is 12 miles on these  I started with static at 13 mile in shopping areas and 1 mile in an open residential area.  Good for kids use or under one  mile in open woods....,2,0,312
A8R57APXJI69F,5156,I was very upset after I first got these hooked up.  Tried and tried to get them to tune in to no avail.  After many expletives and a hissy fit or two. I managed to stumble into the right tuning and was amazed at the clean sound and range.  I plug into my pc for my mp3s. digital box for music and news channels while working in yard or lifting weights out in the garage 100 feet away and through 3 walls!  I recommend these.  Just be patient untill you tune it in right.,4,1,471
A8RABGEOQWBCL,55,I wouldnt use any other. For someone that is lefthanded and sharing the computer with a right handed no brainer. the trackball is adaptable to anyone. It also is very compact and no mouse pad is necessary !!  buy it!  buy it!  C and M,5,1,234
A8RYLG2WJ3KJN,33,Worked very well,4,0,16
A8SEJJAHYT60M,0,This is my second Superadio. The first one was damaged by a nearby lightning strike. This radio really does bring in difficult to tuneAM stations. especially at night when faraway stations cause garbled andfading reception on closer ones. The wide tuning makes it much easier toreceive decent AM signals. My only criticism is the unlit tuning scale a lit one would be a great feature to use at night on the bedside nightstand. FM music quality is very good. All in all. a terrific AMFMreceiver.,4,1,494
A8THC8D64F5E3,11,I bought this tv swing arm mount for my tv from amazon.Its been a good one its built heavy duty to hold pretty big tv .I would have anyone of my friends buy this same mount for their tv. It lets you hang it up and out of the way and also you can turn it out or in adjustable to see it from anywhere I set in my living room. This unit is easy to mount on wall and put together by yourself but if you have an extra person around it would make it a little better when holding the tv up when it clips in at top then screw and tighten and adjustments and like everything else Ive bought from amazon it ships fast right to your door step.,4,1,632
A8TMTZFS8K4IB,0,I have had this radio for almost two years and unfortunately it has recently started acting up .turns off by itself and wont turn back on until you take the batteries out for several hours..  It wasnt until I was without it for a few days that I realized how much I love this radio.  It makes getting ready in the morning so much more enjoyable because you can listen to your favorite radio stations or the morning TV shows.  I have also purchased other shower radios which were impossible to tune into a clear radio station.  This one is great because of its digital tuner and preset AMFMand TV station buttons.  I often take this radio out of the shower and use it to listen to TV shows while I am working outside.  When this radio eventually dies for good. I will not hestitate to replace it with another one by Sony.,5,1,820
A8TZ88OM8YOLW,44,Ive used the RCA RC930 Wireless Modem Jacks to create a poor mans wireless network in my home.  It works!  And I love it!  I can now sit in any chair of my house. surf the web. and print .across the room. to my wireless HP 995 Bluetooth printer.My system consists of two sets of RCA Wireless Modem Jacks .a sender and receiver unit in each set.  one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs .which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected. a 3Com Bluetooth PC card for my laptop and a HP 995 Bluetooth printer.I now use my laptop in the following manner. first. I plug the RCA receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where I want to sit then I turn on the printer and finally. I extend the little blue toothshaped antenna .how cute!. on the laptops PC card  and Im all set to go!The RCA Modem Jack is good up to 56k. which is ok since I dont have internet cable or DSL service in my area.  But Ill gladly tradeoff mobility for speed any day.  Heres why.My desktop computers .old and new. are in my upstairs bedrooms  where I cant use them when my family is sleeping.  They are also far away from where my family spends most of its time  and thats downstairs by the TVs.With the RCA wireless modem jacks. I can now access the internet  while watching TV with my family and I can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep  when internet speeds are fastest.  The connection is fairly clean .free of static. and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if I had accessed the phone jack directly.Ive gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net. When cable or DSL eventually come to my neighborhood. I guess Ill have to set up a wireless network in my home .for a lot more money.  in order to maintain my mobility.Until then. Ill use the next best thing  RCAs Wireless Modem Jacks.  Theyre great!,5,1,1853
A8TZ88OM8YOLW,2123,As a heavy user of my Palm .which I access dozens of times a day.. the Palm Slim Leather Case is perfect for my needs.  I prefer it over other cases for the following reasons.The first is portablity.  I take my Palm everywhere with me .even to the little boys room..  And with the cases slim size. my Palm fits easily into my front pants pocket.  .Carrying my Palm in my shirt pocket is also an option.  But since my company switched to business casual attire. I no longer wear dress shirts with pockets to work.  Hooray!.The second reason is convenience.  With the Palm rail system. the unit is held securely.  And when I need to sync. the case slides off cleanly .the rail system being a simpler and much more elegant solution than the pocket or Velcro holding methods of other products..The third reason is protection.  The rigid cover is slightly padded. and the loop closure is very secure.  .Before adopting this case. I once used another cover  without a loop closure  which failed to protect my Palm when I accidentally dropped it in the street while I waited on the curb for a cab..  The loop closure is also easy to open. so access to my Palm is not restricted.My last reason for selecting this case is its ability to hold business cards.  I put my business cards .a whole slew of them. in the large inside pocket. and I put my kids doctor and dentist appointment reminders in the multiple credit card slots. none of which I want to carry in my wallet .which is already filled with plenty of other stuff..  Since my Palm is always with me. Im never without a business card. so I never miss an opportunity to have my name remembered by the many new customers or vendors I meet..As a comparison. many of the hard cases are very stylish.  But since they cant carry business cards. they arent really adequate for my needs..For a great combination of style and function thats perfect for a heavy Palm user like me  the Palm Slim Leather Case is ideal!,5,1,1956
A8UK2SUUIB3W7,1313,The new NookColor is really great.  I wish is was a little lighter. but aside from that. it is just what I wanted.  Tons of books available. reading them is easy. you can make notes. look up words in dictionary then get more info from Google or Wikipedia.  I really like having magazines on it. altho theyre a bit expensive.  Overall if youre looking for a great reader with a few extras. this is it.,5,1,400

A8X8D4BUY5DFU,0,Not bad quality but not anywhere near TDK EHG. Used one to record at HQ .1 hr.. a documentary and degradation from the original digital was noticeable. It still is much better than prerecorded tapes. which frequently are awful. It does make you appreciate DVDs.,4,1,261
A8XWBF2NFDRC3,0,I tried to installed my 42 LED slim body Vizio Tv which weights around 40 pounds. I located the stud and even used better screws than recommend but this wall mount is not strong enought for a TV of that size and weight. If you read other reviews this wall mount should be good for small tv or monitors of 32 with weight no more than 30 pounds or even less. VideoSecu failed to give the right specifications and I would recommend to use a wall mount the can cover two studs side by side. Good luck to you all in your next purchase.,2,0,530
A8Y4678B5ULS9,0,This product does not work with my base unit at all. even though they are both the same brand.  Sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit. However. is RCA quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely dont work? Very inconvenient for customers. It also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w base units and extensions from the Amazon reviews Ive read. Do your homework and I would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand.,1,0,550

A90J5VZYPZP62,0,I have read that this is a good product if one actually gets it to work. Unfortunatly. if you run Windows 2000 that is very difficult. For some reason. the drivers for Windows 2000 are still in beta. I cant get it to work with my Matrox Millenium G400 even though it is on the approved list. ATI does not support drivers and software that are in beta so they are of no help in resloving the issues with their buggy software. My advice is to buy a product that has software that works properly under Windows 2000 or to wait until this one does.,1,0,543

A95FMI8GNN32W,0,This is a great product just a few things that I thought the rio company left out. prosu0026gt great sound quality and everything is neat. consu0026gtIt is a little tricky to set up.the port stuff is a little hard they didnt  include great detail on it. next the software is ok that they give you but  It doesnt give you the choice of what sound qualityu0026ltkbpsu0026gt that you  want. which will save you memory if you get the right quality you want. I  recommend you download realjuke box if you get the rio. it is a little  better than the rio manager software.,5,1,566
A95JV9YGTCNTZ,1617,It works and it is one of the only shower radios out there these days. The stations come in quite well and we keep ours IN the shower with us. Its easy to use. Id recommend it to anyone for a great shower radio. It was a wonderful wedding present  one of our favorites for sure!,4,1,278

A9692QW5SWG0H,0,This product description says it is a NOOK Tablet. I received a NOOK Color. I emailed the seller and was told it was correct as per the Amazon product description. No where in the description does it say anything but a NOOK Tablet. And if anyone has done even an ounce of research knows a Nook Tablet and Color are 2 VERY different things. They have sent me a return label and I have been told I will get a full refund....so we will see how fast and easy that process will be.,2,0,476
A96L2RK4JXODS,12,I ordered a data cable for nokia 2720 as pictured with a small square data cable and received from yourselves a two prongcharger cable one a needlelike charger cable and the other a small square ended data cable that is too big and cannot be plugged into cellphone .

A9743XZGR2MBC,0,Received this DVD Player as a gift and it worked pretty good for about a year. Inserted a DVD last week and it just died. Took it to an RCA certified repair shop for repair and was told that when they called RCA for schematic info they were told not to attempt repair. Repairman said he was given a 1800 number for me to call and for an outrageous amount of USDUSD I could send it to RCA for repairreplacement. What a great service policy.,2,0,439
A97ZKXQ5M23SK,22,Once great. now garbage.This product used to be one of the best. possibly the best. dry head cleaners out there. It never failed to clean our vhs heads. usually with only one cycle and with no noticeable harm. It came in a blue box with a picture of two women on the front. The cleaner ran for around twenty seconds and featured an aquarium theme.Unfortunately. in the last year or so. Maxell has replaced this item with a head cleaner that shows nothing but static. must be run through several times. and then doesnt work anyway. My result was only product failure. but from reviews here. it seems that actual harm to the vcr is possible. If you are lucky enough to find an older blue box version of this cleaner. get it while you can. But stay away from the yellow boxbirds on cover Maxlink edition.,1,0,801
A98PPJJD3RBCH,33,These things are hard to find with the features I need. This headset is just right. No presstotalk button on the cord. so the talk button on the walkietalkie works properly. Comfortable headset and ear pads. Nothing extra that I didnt need. I highly recommend this useful item.,5,1,277
A98WI4F8V3GJP,12,This has great features including the ability to hook up to an external antenna.  Prior to adding an external antenna it worked ok. but I had some reception problems.  I liked the idea of using it as a handheld outside the vehicle BUT I have yet to do that with it.The unit has good volume.  Space in a Jeep is limited so I love that this is so small.  The channel lock is another great feature.  It eliminates accidental channel changes while bouncing around.,4,1,460
A9A673ZJS3ZGI,11,Pros. Thicker than many other cable locks Ive owned. Locks and unlocks easily. so you dont have to spend five minutes trying to lock. and then another five minutes trying to unlock. your computer. It DOES wiggle around on my netbook. which is why the rubber bumper is really nice. but doesnt wiggle around on my laptop. So whether you get the wiggle people were talking about depends on the computer slot youre dealing with. It is superior in every way. though. to the Kensington combination lock with the coiled cable. which is what I bought before this one. That one chewed the heck out of the plastic casing on my computer around the slot because it was so difficult to lock!! So if youre choosing between a Kensington combination and a Kensington key. go with the key. Your poor computer casing will thank you.Cons. As others have mentioned. its a little short. Also Im a bit concerned about the if someone tampers with it you can never unlock it again!! feature others have mentioned. but Ill deal with that when it happens. if it does. Key is a little bulky to carry.I use this as part of a multitiered security system. Of course a lock alone wont stop someone with a bolt cutter. Im only hoping to slow down a casual snatch and grab thief who might try to take advantage of me taking a quick bathroom break in class or such.,4,1,1331
A9BKIPTBOUDSV,0,This same drive seems to be sold under many different brand names. Obviously not very high quality. but I need the ability to transfer data by floppy disk to an older machine u0026 this seems to be the only option.I bought 2. 1 works .for now. and the other just wanted to reformat all the time. whether there was a disk in it or not.

A9C3MB170D9KO,0,My player arrived last night. Im totally nuts about it. I only found time to write a review because Im at work and cant watch. OK. the base gets a little warm after a while. but big deal.  Fantastic device. highly  recommeded.,5,1,226
A9ELHLPXF7JKD,45,A pretty good device overall. but one thing really bugs me.  I have it in a leather case.  I was carrying it in my hand one day and I dropped it.  Only one exposed area got a tiny speck of a nick. but the rest of the  device was cushioned by the leather.  That incident caused all the screen  touch points to drop.  In order to activiate something. I have to touch  below where it is displayed on the screen.  The functions on the bottom  moved almost completely out of range. and the writing area shifted down  also.  I cant tell if its because the writing area shifted downwards. but  the graffiti recognition is slower and less accurate too.  I cant say  anything else bad about it. but what a letdown to know that it cant take  simple impacts.,3,0,747
A9F11H8S6Q39J,2835,Almost a year to the day after the camera was bought. i turn it on and it greets me with SYSTEM ERROR and a LOUD clicking noise coming from the lens side of the camera. lovely. havent taken it in yet to see how much this is going to cost me.and this is with me ONLY taking approx 40 pictures.,1,0,292
A9FK70SX9LBSY,611,The quality of the pictures .fair to average. are on par with cameras in the USD100USD200 range. If you look at the resolution of other cameras listed in the USD400 price range you will find others have mucher higher resolution.  Im not sure who Sony is trying to fool but certainly not me.,2,0,290

A9I4TBQM0XV5K,11,Ive now put several hundred miles of highway driving on my Midland 18258 without incident. It has survived several episodes of 40+ MPH winds. Receive range is around 24 miles and transmit range is around 12 miles. SWRs tune down to about 1.5 to 1... not perfect. but very acceptable.When mounting both inner and outer components to glass. make sure neither is covering any defroster wires. Also make sure the antenna pivot screw is very tight else the whip has a tendency to pivot and fall while driving. Putting a bit of Loctite or Super Glue on the screw threads will help keep the screw tight over time if this becomes a problem.The 18258 is a decent solution for those who do not want to mount a magnetic or permanent CB antenna to their vehicle and only need to operate within close range.,4,1,794
A9IGBY0OA5RUK,35,For the price. its OK if you only will be using to upload music. listen to music. or copy CDs or regular DVDs.  It will not recognize double layered DVDs  DVDs that are 8.5 GB.,3,0,176
A9J3LMY955WKJ,11,I have seen the Kindle and wish I would have gotten it.  The kindle was out of stock and I got the Nook.

If I had to do it again the Kindle would be the way to go. but Amazon lost a sale and was out of stock...,4,1,368
A9J3UUIH5QRC9,37,Extremely slow FF and Rewind.  My kid is autistic and she watches VHS all the time. so I was depending on this thing to work.  I was putting up with it and using it about once a day. but  it broke after  2 months.  We got an excellent . cheap replacement on eyou know.,1,0,268

A9K49PQMU9V1X,912,If you take only 1 thing from this review. let it be this. THIS CAMERA IS NOT FOR YOU IF YOU PLAN TO DO PHOTOEDITING .MANIPULATION.Most of the photos you take with this camera will look a little blurry on your computer screen. and God forbid you ZOOMIN on the photo using your photoviewing program.  The quality of the photos is horrible .mostly due to the .jpg compression. and gives the photo a pastelcolor look to it.  The camera does have a setting to take better quality pictures using .BMP capability but when you use this setting you will be able to fit ONLY 1 PHOTO PER FLOPPY DISK.  Although the quality is better when using .BMP it is still not good enough for a serious photographer.The LCD screen will get fingerprints on it if you even THINK about putting your finger anywhere near it and if youre under strong sunlight it is hard to see the image.  A viewfinder wouldve come in handy. however.. I like the idea of not having to put the camera up to my face to take a pic.  A necessary evil you might say.If you DONT have money to burn. do yourself a favor and either wait until digital cameras are a dimeperdozen or take out a mortgage loan to save up for the FD90 Sony model.  I dont know about you. but ...+ is not something I part with easily least of all for a camera.WHAT IT IS GOOD FOR. Online Auctions .Ebay.. Unimportant pics.  Also. credit must be given where credit is due. For me. the main selling point of the Sony FD series is disk storage capacity.  This is a definite plus that enables you to share photographs with other people when they dont have a photodownloading facility in their PC .in my experience this includes one hell of alot of people..The 10x zoom is also a Godsend. You can almost use the camera as binoculars if you want to.  The camera also enables you to format a floppy disk .at the expense of alot of battery life..  A fully charged battery will give u approximately 2.5 hrs of camera use.In closing  Get this camera if you truly have your heart set on it. but be forewarned about the day that you are going to want to take the PERFECT PHOTO.  Its not going to happen with the FD73.  Not in the standard .jpg compression it delivers. and not at the 640x480 maximum capacity size.,3,0,2228
A9MOPP2X497W1,8891,I am very happy with this camera. I have never had a digital camera before  and there is so much that I can do it. I bought it as a gift for my wife  and she uses it for auctions on EBay.  It is easy to learn how to use.  It  does provide some documentation in hardback form unlike someother models.  I would recomend you to buy a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries and  it wouldnot hurt to buy at minimum. a 16 megabyte memory card.  The 8  megabyte card is fine for use around the house. but for example a vacation.  a 16 megabyte allows more flexiblity.  I gave it four stars because the  within 2 hours of receiving it. my wife was taking pictues and putting  those items up for auction.  I like this product and have recommended it to  friends.,4,1,755
A9MZROA9WNRJT,1213,I used this to mount a 42  TCL tv.  Mounted up great.  Nice that it includes a full set of different size screws to find the right match for your tv.  By the time this was on the wall. I did need to retighten the tension bolts to keep the tv at the right angle on the wall.  Full motion tilt is nice. but I imagine lots of repositioning might need more tightening down the road.,4,1,378
A9NWB7KLAU967,0,My father is a huge fan of this radio. as I am. Sound quality is very good without being a boombox. This radio does a good job pulling in weak AM signals. so it would be a good choice if you live in a remote area.,4,1,213
A9O2TF78V878G,33,I REALLY like it. except I didnt know it needed a speaker system! .I am not very bright when it comes to electronics..  I temporary plugged it into my computer speakers. until I found small Sound system that I liked.  I love all the features of my JVC 5CD Changer. and use the random button a lot.  The Remote Control works wonderfully. also!,5,1,342

A9Q3HPIZ3OUPN,0,I was thrilled to find this item since my identical unit had stopped working.  I received the unit in the original plastic sealed package.  I noticed before opening that the foam from the headphones was crumbling but that didnt bother me since I was not planning on using them.  However. the Walkman itself never worked.  The thirdparty supplier would not refund my money. saying that nowhere in his description did he say it would work and that it was sold as more of a collectors item. After filing a claim with Amazon. I was told to return the item to the supplier who once again repeated that he would not return my money.  I did however receive reimbursement from Amazon. I compliment Amazon on their claim process and warn others not to assume an item will work when purchased from this supplier unless it is specified in the description.,1,0,844
A9RE6P27GLL0P,22,Its perfect travel size. Easy downloads. I just love it ! Came in pretty fast and even though the case had some wear it was amazing. Thanks !,4,1,141

A9U1BQILTMSMM,625,My husband. young daughters and I own horses. and trailride at least once a week. Santa brought us four of these lovely little twoways this year at Christmas. and I couldnt be more pleased. Weve had none of the troubles noted in the other reviews. .although we dont ride on mountaintops.. and my children find the radios simple to use and easy to understand .not to mention the cool factor!..The radios are durable weve dropped them in snowbanks. had them grawed on by curious horses. and thumped around in saddlebags. Theyre certainly useful. we know if one of us gets separated from the others theyll be able to radio in and figure out where we are. And for what we use them for. theyre just perfect. We looked at a bunch of GPS handhelds. and decided we didnt need anything quite that high end. For the average family who hikes or skis. trailrides or just goes to the Mall of America. these are the perfect belt accessory. Go for it!,5,1,936
A9U1BQILTMSMM,2022,I bought one of these for my husband as an early Fathers Day present. and he loves it. He says u0026quotbecause its small and convenient. its always there so you can make quick notes as needed. Its perfect for keeping track  of incidental expenses much more easily than fumbling with notes and  remembering things.Another nice feature is that using the HotSynch  connection. the PP easily transfers information back and forth from  computer to the PP itself. This is especially effective when one uses  Outlook. and the PP will even allow you to write and store email which will  automatically be sent later. if you choose.u0026quotHe loves this thing.  uses it all the time. and it certainly makes him more organized. His last  word on it is.u0026quotI should have bought one a year ago!u0026quotGo for  it folks. you wont be disappointed.,5,1,840

A9UOB704J3VZ2,33,After reading the online reviews. I found a similar product for USD19.99 at a local store.

A9VWTFU19QE3H,9696,The pad jumps from left to right seemingly at random. drivers dont fix it. and there is no update anywhere that I have found .and ive been looking.

A9X4V6G6JIOMS,0,I purchased mine from Amazon.com.  As a long time devotee to SLR cameras I wanted a compact camera with many of the features of an SLR. including a telephoto capability. but without the size and weight.  I found the Olympus  Stylus Epic Zoom 80 with panarama an excellent substitute. especially when  weight andor convenience is a consideration. The standard and panarama  photos have been of excellent quality. The camera adapts to different light  conditions quite well. providing a clear picture. even in lower light.  Olympus recommends ASA 400 film. but I found ASA 200 to do quite well. You  do have the ability to override the flash and the autofocus when you need  to. which is a plus for those who like that feature in a true SLR camera.  The ability to carry the camera in a shirt pocket has meant that I have  taken pictures on hikes. birding with friends. in museums and any other  place where a larger camera would have been more of a hinderance. than a  help.  Definitely recommend it as a good buy.,5,1,1013
A9YBYH2FR60E3,3738,I bought this CD player a while back. hoping it would solve my problems... I was using a 1989... YES. 1989 SONY discman until now... no antiskip of course. which is why i bought the koss. The first thing to go was the  battery door. would not lock. The headphones I must admit were pretty  decent. but my ears hurt after 20 minutes or so... im an innerear  headphone person. The cassette adapter was kind of quiet. with poor stereo  seperation. The headphone jack developed a bad contact. so I found myself  using the UNAMPLIFIED lineout jack. I finally realized this player was on  its way out... so I managed to trade a SONY DISCMAN .1994. with car kit  for it. with a friend of mine. A month later. the KOSS broke .LCD  cracked.... and NOW. 5 months after .not to mention 5 years.... the SONY  works perfectly still! He regrets trading with me. I recommend you go spend  an extra 20 dollars and get a nice SONY Discman! KOSS should stick to  headphones! I am not an abusive person. my stuff usually lasts VERY long...  this player isnt designed for the real world... much too fragile!,1,0,1087

A9ZTFA4O4RXZK,33,I was going on a business trip. and didnt have time to get these in through Amazon.  I had a previous version that went bad after four years. so I bought another pair .through Walmart..Maxell really cheapened these up.  The phone jack was flimsy. and started having problems after only three uses in my laptop.  The fit around the ears was nowhere near as nice as the previous pair I had. and there seemed to be an intermittent .more on than off. constant tone around 9000 hz that was quite irritating.Save yourself the time and aggravation with this pair. spend the money on a nice AudioTechnica unit .like Im going to do. and get something that meets your needs for the long haul.,1,0,682
AA0RIZBSA1XOZ,78,I needed this length .50 ft.. and could never find it in stock at Walmart. etc. I found this one online w Amazon and it was cheaper than in other stores or even on other websites. Brand is great and the product isnt cheaply made like some other brands. Its a good buy!,5,1,268
AA1XXH3XLZVDD,22,I was excited to try this product for my DirecTV DVR connection without having to install another phone jack. Simply put. it didnt work.

AA70BU7RTBOMM,0,Buried deep within the User Manual .available online at Sabrents web site. is the troubleshooting observation that you MUST wait  one full minute  .use a timer. between plugging it in and inserting a 1.44 MB floppy .it does NOT support ANY other density..Follow that directive and the device will work pretty much like any ordinary floppy.Before reading that directive. I was about to join those who swore the device would not work at all. It had repeatedly failed to read ANY floppy. The only other problem Ive encountered .in only 1 hour of testing. is that the device driver .written by Microsoft. hung on one occasion. requiring a reboot to resolve.I would also note that the User Manual available online is for a Teac drive while the drive they sent me is a Mitsumi drive. That said. the Teac User Manual seems entirely applicable to the Mitsumi drive. But. if you search the Sabrent web site for the model number of the Mitsumi drive .FLUDRV.. you will find .at this time. no information on that model number at all.,4,1,1022

AAEVGE52KL0DJ,11,I bought these to power my wifes first high output LED flashlight. They did work. but didt last nearly as long as Id expected. The charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries. we just werent impressed.I ended up replacing each pair with a single Panasonic 3100 mA 18650 battery and have been much happier.

AAI5HB1HXKYRD,44,One reviewer is definitely right ... dont listen to quiet music if you use these speakers. Also. the sound quality is kind of mediocre.  The biggest problem is that they pick up every signal from every cell phone in my entire apartment complex and amplify it.  Beyond that. one of the speakers. after 8 months of use. no longer works very well ... its very quiet and muffledraspy.  Buyer beware.,1,0,395
AAIBQXOGF2XSX,55,This product was very easy to install into the computer and works great.  If you need it. GET IT!  It is very helpful,4,1,117
AAIOE9PQ97HCK,5,I just bought the Diamond Rio PMP500 and its great.  There are a few downsides though. the software is a little confusing at first but in just a short while I had no trouble with it. the headphones it comes with are  uncomfortable and dont have very good sound. also it eats up batteries  like crazy and doesnt have an available AC adapter.  I suggest buying  rechargeable batteries and a charger so you dont go broke buying  batteries. and if you do use regular batteries make sure theyre something  like Duracell Ultra or another battery for high tech equipment.  Other than  those few downsides the Rio 500 is great. the sound quality is great its  very portable and has some great features.,4,1,694
AAIW1MVNJOMS2,0,This is a nice package.Alkaline and rechargeable battery packs are included. along with the charger. Rechargeable batteries are NOT included.The radio has a lot of features .scan. weather. dual watch .....As a walkie talkie with the included rubber duckie antenna. range is pretty limited .as expected.. If you buy a Cobra HATA HandHeld CB Antenna. it will almost double the range.I have not used the radio with the car adaptor yet. I expect the radio will perform a lot better with a mobile antenna.My only real complaint is that the modulation .transmitted audio. is low and a bit muffled.The weather radio works well.The radio can be easily .although illegally. modified for 120 channels AM. 80 channels with an AM  FM mix or some kind of UK mod that wasnt described. Info is available by searching the web. I dont know who is using these frequencies but I would avoid interfering with the 10M Ham band.There is supposed to be an audio mod but I was not able to find it. This  would probably make a big difference.,4,1,1017

AALSLK1P1IT2A,11,The radio interference really is quite bad.  Granted. I live in downtown Atlanta. and you can probably pick up FM on your fillings. but even without connecting it to a sound source. I could hear radio.  After monkeying with various configurations. I discovered that looping the subs input twice  around the speaker .with a single twist. reduced the static to an  acceptable level.  What worked even better was just crumpling up the input  cable and holding it in my fist but I got hungry and had to let go.,3,0,506

AAM6K9BX8HS51,0,Purchased two of these radios to use with my son while deer hunting from tree stands. Found these units to work exceptionally well.  The range and  clarity were superb .especially from the added height of the tree  location..  The call feature is very valuable when location of your hunting  buddy is quickly needed.  Although the backlight does go off a bit quickly.  a push of the PTT button will tell you if the unit is on or not.  The price  of these units make them a real value.  Plan on using them next while  fishing to keep in touch with the other boat or my wife back at camp.  A  top notch value.,5,1,607
AAMXCGEATDWBG,4548,I did not get the product that is pictured.

AANSPH7B2AT7X,11,Works but got rid of it because of the loud mechanical sounds from the internal gears  squeaking. grinding. crunching sounds. Much worse than my previous Maxell adapter.  Poor manufacturing! Ordered the Philips USA PH62050 CDMP3MDToCassette Adapter for which the Amazon reviews about noise are much better .and its a buck cheaper to boot..  Indeed. the Philips was very good.  Buy it. Dont buy the Maxell. Youll be happier.UPDATE to review. about a year after purchase. the Philips is making louder and louder noises.  I guess noise is endemic to these adapters.,1,0,562

AAQDL02XWY1GJ,0,This is by far the best choice if youre looking for a low priced tablet. I have the iPad. but honestly I feel guilty owning it since I dont want to take it anywhere despite its Otterbox case. Its too big and bulky to put in my purse and the only reason I got it was to read books and magazines on the larger screen. It doesnt make sense for my purposes especially when I have the iPhone.The rooted Nook Color . however. is perfect. Especially since Amazon doesnt have a color Kindle yet. Great size. fast speed. USD150 refurbished price. and I have Gingerbread 2.3 installed on a microSD card so I dont have to worry about the warranty. This is an awesome choice for anyone looking for either a reader andor a tablet on the cheap.,5,1,730
AARHLUIV2NNI2,34,This Trackball is an older version which comes with an adapter so that you can use either serial or PS2 ports .the adapter itself is worth the price of the unit nowadays  converting 9 pin serial to PS2..  I like trackballs because they do not have to be moved around like a mouse.  You simply roll the ball to get the cursor to move.  This particular version seems equally adaptive to right and left handed individuals.  It is easy to zip around and click the controls.  Having said this. there are some reservations.  You do need to periodically pop the trackball out and clean it with warm soapy water on a paper towel and also clean the two rollers inside the same way.  The main problem is that finger oils eventually lubricate the rollers and make it slip some. causing the performance to get sluggish.  This version uses the regular mouse driver that is already in the computer and can be calibrated to whatever PC you have.  You will probably need to calibrate it so that it has the right feel. since its sensitivity is different than a mouse.  I got my present version at a Thrift store and have happily used it for a long time and it never ceased to function.  The modern optical trackballs do work better and are more responsive. but they are mainly for USB ports and are more expensive.,4,1,1297
AAT8IHMOM2RI0,11,I purchased this card about 4 years ago for my desktop system .which was top of the line at 200MHZ MMx. etx..how times have changed!.  This is probably the best 3D card out there ONLY if you happen to get the All in  Wonder Pro though  with 3d capability and Video Capture you cant go wrong  with the price but this card .even at the low price. is probably not going  to help you in the area of video memory .only 8mb. if you plan on doing any  type of extensive video editing or special effects.  If you can. I would  try to find the AllInWonder card .also 8mb. if youre willing to spend  the money on it.  .Youre better off spending the extra 5075 to buy a 16  or even 32 mb video card nowadays..,4,1,698
AAT8IHMOM2RI0,1112,if youre not embroiled in the MP3 craze.  I recently purchased this radio for the second time .for my girlfriend. because it is probably the best stereo out there for the workplace.  As the price indicates. this isnt a  boombox which youre going to carry on your shoulder down the street but  rather a light to medium range sounding box which is compact in size .fits  great on the workdesk. and wont annoy the coworkers.  I would suggest  buying this to ease your time at work and only if youve just about lost  your mind if your companys central air system is driving you nuts!,4,1,579

Hingeopening holds cover in place for handsfree viewingIn real...... 1. Made out of plastic. 2. The spring is too weak to keep the cover closed. 3. Which makes it more difficult to write. as the Palm doesnt  fit in the palm of your hand anymore..And I paid a 33 hard earned bucks .10% of what the PalmV cost. on this cheap Made In China thing that I have to keep closed with a rubberband. Thats what I call a ripp off.I will return it and ask my 6 year old son to make something nice for fathersday.

Unless you turn the volume of the source and the tape player all the way up. you cannot hear anything but a background noise. Even if with the max volume. there is a background noise. I am not sure if the jack configuration is the problem or the adapter itself has a problem. but there is definitely a problem.,1,0,404
AB0JGM8T04TZC,2,This is a great product. I just got it in today and within five minutes its installed and on the network.

I sent it back for another and it was bad as well. Now I have this card and it works like a charm.,5,1,391

NOW I find out that 1.000.000 other people have the same problem with Sony. I am on my way to buy a Panasonic or something. But anyway. be forewarned.....this product malfunctions..I promise you. it will happen. What a load of junk!

AB7I4CQ6LUFAJ,0,I owned one of these back when they first came out. I paid 80 bucks for it. well 79.99 at staples. lol This was the best trackball device I have ever or probably ever know. The reason I believe this did so well for me was I can brace the ball with my thumb. NOT fingers. I move it with my fingers and brace it with my thumb so it has WAY more control of the ball then what you see today as trackballs. GOD do I miss this now. I never should have sold it long long ago. oh well Ill be buying one soon again. If your looking for an AWESOME trackball. THIS is the one for you!,5,1,573
AB936OVPK4DN8,33,There are a lot of upsides and a lot of downsides to this product.  First thing that I need to say though. is that they have updated one very important aspect of the Rio 500.  There is now availability to use a 64 MB  SmartMedia card which makes a huge amount of difference when comparing this  mp3 player to others out in the market.I originally bought a 64 MB  card when my Rio arrived. and it did not work.  But. after emailing  DiamondS3. they promptly .12 weeks. not bad considering they had to  update the firmware. corrected the problem. and now the 500 works great.  I  can fit nearly 30 songs at the 128 ksec rate.  Its about 23 hours of  quality play. depending on your rate preferences.The controls on the  unit itself are excellent in my opinion.  It is true that they are not .at  all. well described in the putrid manual.  We really cant refer to it as a  manual. more like a tiny folded poster.  The blue backlit screen is really  great.  Also. the text is clear and neat looking.  Many people say they  wish the Rio 500 had the circular playpausestopffrew controller. but I  think its fine the way it is.  I suppose its up to you.  But the unit is  light. slick. and very nice in general.The sound quality. as with all  Rios. is pretty much as good as it gets for mp3 players.  Get good  headphones though. as it is true that the ones they provide just dont cut  it.  Besides just the headphones issue is the small problem that the volume  level 20 .the loudest. is not as loud as one may like it to be.  But  considering what many people need the Rio for. its understandable that it  doesnt break any records for loudness.  It really isnt that  necessary.Here come some problems... The software really is horrible.  Its just not as good as many other options.  But since those options are  generally free .MusicMatch. RealJukebox. etc.. its not really worth  worrying about.How about the transfer of data?  Well. first. a good  thing is that the Rio 500 uses USB connection. which allows for the  transfer of a song in mere seconds.  However. beware. because if the  battery is low when you transfer. you could damage the Rio.  Word is.  however. that they now have a utility for fixing this problem if it  happens.  Better than the old plan of sending the customer a refurbished  one.WMA.  I have heard that this format is going to be better than mp3.  but the 500 does not support it... yet.  Hopefully. they will upgrade the  firmware some day to support it. but as of now. they arent.Last of all.  what about the Rio 600 and soon to come Rio 800?  Well. the 600 comes with  only 32 MB of RAM and costs less.  But how much will it cost to get it up  to 128 MB?  Im not sure.  I think that if you can get a good deal on a 64  MB SmartMedia Card. the 500 is quite enough with the 128 MB. at least until  the next generation of players which will store songs in the GB range.  The  price of the 500 will likely go down with the 600 here. so it isnt the rip  off it once was.  The 600 has different colored face plates. but how  important is that?  Depends on what you want from the Rio.  The 600 is a  tiny bit lighter than the 500. but that is not even negotiable .about .2  oz...So. overall. I think the 500 is a great product.  When its  working well. its completely awesome.  If they upgrade the firmware to  support WMA. the 500 would become even more flexible.  And with the  availability of 128 MB of RAM. it can boast space that many other mp3  players cant.  .Keep in mind that the largest SmartMedia card available  now is 64 MB. leaving the noflash memory players at a 64 MB maximum..  Its cool. and it does the job.  And from what I have seen. DiamondS3 has  a decent support staff.  If you want a nice mp3 player that will last a  while. or at least until the amount of memory doesnt matter anymore. this  is a great choice.,4,1,3854

ABDHAYPNM28US,0,With my computers only free drive bay occupied by a CDRewriter. and most of its ports supporting other gadgets. this USB Zip drive seemed like a good addition to my expanding collection of software and peripherals.Based upon my experience with this product. I highly recommend Zip  drives in principle. They provide consolidation and backup points for  files scattered throughout many conventional floppy disks. facilitate the  storage of large files .particularly visual. that would not make it on  floppies. and liberate hard drive space.As for this product in  particular. its portability is an obvious asset. I also highly recommend it  for those who dont want to disembowel their computers and literally risk  getting their wires crossed. Although I cant speak for those with other  systems. installation was quite easy on Windows 98. This device also works  quite smoothly. accepting files from my floppy disks and hard drive rather  quickly.The ejection of Zip disks is not too much of an inconvenience  I just place a hand or finger in front of the drive when it happens .After  fifteen minutes of inactivity. the drive will eject disks automatically...  And. even though my desktop system doesnt have the appropriate  u0026quotiMacu0026quot look. the Zip drive still looks quite stylish!,5,1,1296

ABF8QAQ2HV8A5,39,The Nook Color overall isnt a bad product but I am giving it two stars because the charging cable is obviously defective and once the warranty is out Bu0026N will charge you USD15.00 for their proprietary cable. They should take responsibility for the bad cable and give customers replacements for free .even after the warranty is out. rather than charge customers an inflated price for their mistake.. My Nook Color has been very lightly used but is out of warranty now. so I went to a local Bu0026N store today and paid USD16.01 for a cable that I know may last only a few months.,2,0,582
ABFMCMZDV4J75,0,Item not as pictured in this Amazon item page.

I may have received the wrong item but does also not have the holes pictured in the pictures on the flat part of the mount that connects to back of TV. Also not included are the extension arms which are pictured in every photo.  Very misleading!!! Other than that this a great product and I will be keeping as I dont want to deal with returning. just wanted to warn other buyers.Also. if you have a larger TV dont waist your time with this mount as you will have to purchase the extension kit MLEB from VideoSecu which is another USD15 making this mount more expensive than other all in one VESA 400x400 units.,3,0,840

ABIN1JYQ9F3J,11,Wow. i cant believe how much is the Nook 3G Bu0026W worth right now. I bought mine in 2011 at little over 200 dollars. With all the accessories .extra long charging cord. leather case and flower sticker. i paid around 260 USD! I really enjoyed this device. but i think it was just way too pricey. I wish i didnt make that purchase at a time because it wasnt worth the money.Concept is great. battery lasts for ages. but its slow. internet through wifi is very very very slow and difficult to navigate since the touch screen is only that tiny panel at the bottom.I bought it because i thought it was cool. its really great when reading in full sunlight and battery goes on forever without having to charge again. But in reality. whenever i go to the beach sun makes my eyes too lazy to read. and at home the screen seems to dim to be reading on. I still prefer real books. and when on vacation i always find some nice 12 USD used books that do the justice.I dont know....i loved this product when i purchased it. but like i said. i wouldnt make his purchase again. at least not at anything over 100 bucks,3,0,1103
ABJ5B33ZAK1XU,11,I am so happy that I purchased this pair of headphones! I have never owned anything but the dinky 5 dollar ones before. and was sick of having  constantly aching ears from the poor sound quality. as well as cheap parts  rubbing against sensitive ear bits. These phones have changed everything.  Heres the good stuff. *They have rich. deep sound. and block out or muffle  outside noise. *Supercomfortable! They hug around your ears rather than  pressing against them.  *Little to no distortion at high volume levels.  *Big bass  I have tested these guys with some of the bassiest techno I  could find. and it performed exceedingly well. *The extralong cord. with  the mute and volume control within easy reach. are very convenient.Now  the bad points. * They are big. and they are clunky.  * If you are in a hot  room. they will make you sweatier because they cover so much skin. Also.  people who are claustophic about things around their heads or faces will  find this uncomfortable. and are probably better off getting a much smaller  set of phones. * Treble could use a little bit of work. Very heavy bass at  very high volume will drown out the treble. which makes listening annoying.  However. if you are listening on a device that has equalizer control. you  can probably adjust it to a more comfortable level. Also. this probably  wont even come up unless you are listening to some heavy techno. etc.  *They are heavy and tend to want to slip off your hair while you wearing  them. No headbanging with these puppies on!  .But man. they are so  comfortable! The sound is very nice much nicer than I expected for the  price.  If you are looking for a comfy pair of heradphones that will allow  you to really *enjoy* your music. try these on for size.  Enjoy!,4,1,1763
ABJ5B33ZAK1XU,3636,I bought my CD Player back in December. and it has not failed me yet! The car adapter waorks very well. and the unit itself offers okay sound. For the price of this item. you have to know that you arent going to get  u0026quotstate of the artu0026quot anything  but the antiskip feature has  worked fine for me. the sound is fine and I utilize the u0026quotHoldu0026quot  switch .which keeps the units buttons from being accidenatlly pressed. and  the Bass Boost. The Bass Boost is pretty wimpy. although I must admit that  Ive never tried it with goodquality headphones. which might change the  sound considerably. Speaking of headphones. my included pair did break  about three months after I started using them. I simply replaced them with  another cheap pair.Complaints of short battery life can probably be  attributed to the user leaving the antiskip protection on for long periods  of time. In my experience. this will drain the batteries faster than  anything else. when using any CD player. If you need to use the batteries  for an extended time. try to *not* use the Skip Protection. or else try to  find a way to use one of included two adapters. Overall. I am very  satisfied with my purchase. although your mileage may vary.In  conclusion. I must say that if you are looking for topquality sound and  construction. look elsewhere if you just need something to play your CDs  in and you cant afford to spend a lot of cash. this ones for you.,4,1,1453

ABO405O29CU1O,58,I am very happy with my cable lock. Although it does not make your computer equal to Fort Knox. it will at the very least slow a wouldbe theif down. I can hang my 8lb laptop off of it. and bounce it up and down with the cable. and it holds firm .trial conducted over my bed. a heavily padded surface.. I like how the cable swivels around the actual lock to avoid the cable kinking. and becoming cumbersome. I also like the fact that it is a key operated system. Although combinations are quicker. they can be hacked in about 5 minutes of trying. and slipping a key in the lock and giving a quick turn cant be any simpler. Just remember to keep one key in a safe place. and write the key serial number down somewhere so a replacement can be found. For the money.

The portable features are perfect i can not find any thing that needs improvements and i am a very picky person about my electronics. Its time to rethink your communications when it comes to needing to stay in constant contact in a very large work setting such as a rock query or high rise job site. I have gotten rid of a USD894 a month cell phone bills i just gave the crew 2 way radios and i told them that the first one is on me and if they want the best portable radio on the planet then get a MidLand 75822.,5,1,804
ABPUIIIAJ37QL,22,After searching fruitlessly for months for this cameras cheaper little brother. the ePhoto 780c. I decided to spend the extra USD100 and get this one instead.  Im happy I made the choice this camera has MUCH higher  resolution. a very nice incamera user interface .its remarkably easy to  set the focus and flash and step through your pictures on the cameras LCD  screen.and great connectivity features it handles CompactFlash memory  nicely. and has both serial and USB .the BEST! . connection options.  I  easily hooked it up to both my PC and my Mac its a snap.Theres only  one problem. and its a big one. this guy gobbles batteries like crazy.  If  youre using the flash and LCD viewfinder to frame your pictures. expect to  burn through a set of 4 AA batteries in about 35 minutes.  Using the  optical viewfinder and remembering to use the flash judiciously .this  camera handles low light well. even without the flash. will extend battery  life. but even so. youll only get about 34 hours of life out of each set  of batteries. MAX.  The solution is to get a set or three of NiMH .nickel  metal hydride. batteries and a charger particularly. if youre getting  this camera as a gift. throw the batteries and charger in!  Once youve got  those. youve got one dynamite little camera.,4,1,1286

ABRM9TJXT4R3G,0,I do not use any other mouse than this one. This mouse is the best mouse I have found to prevent Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The claims of this mouse getting dirty are correct. however. I have found several ways of fixing it. The first thing I do is to use a QTip cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol and clean the rollers. The isopropyl alcohol will dissolve the dirt that gets in the mouse. The second thing I do is to rub the rollers inside with sandpaper. The rollers have a tendency to get smooth and that combined with the smoothness of the trackball makes this mouse prone to being affected by dirt. The sandpaper solution is very effective.,4,1,641

ABVT14HHZ97MF,22,The speakers that came with my HP Pavillion were pathetically poorthe sound was distorted. volume was limited. and they were filled with garbage noise.

ABXRW35VD0QJ1,13,My family and I love this little camera. We didnt wanna spend too much on  one but we wanted nice quailty pictures. Inside and up to 12 an inch away  the pictures were so clear we could count the hairs in our eyebrows on high  mode. Its easy to use and the feel of the camera is really nice. If you  dont to be a professional photographer and just want great pics of your  family and friends then this camera is excellent. Only problem we have had  is in having to cut off the computer and restart each time we wanna  download pictures but this is easily fixed with a floppy disk reader that  can be bought to read the cards into the computer. I give it rave reviews.,4,1,667

AC0RMV74UAJRQ,0,At first I had it hanging under the shower head where it would occasionally get a splash.  On the 3rd or 4th shower water got into it and it quit working.  I put it in the bedroom for a couple of weeks to dry out and it worked again. Then I put it on the window sill in the shower where it would rarely get water on it but it didnt last long there either.  I let it dry out again and put it on a self over the sink in the bathroom where it would never get wet but apparently the steam condensed inside it because there was water in it again .I could see tiny little drops on the inside of the display.. After that I threw it a way.  Needless to say I was very disappointed in a Shower Radio I couldnt even keep in the bathroom let a lone the shower itself.,1,0,756

AC2SMT7WEOBQM,0,I read the good reviews and I read the bad ones.  More good ones then bad ones so I decided to check this lock out for myself.Well. ya got this heavy cable. that yes. you can cut thru if you have cutters on hand. which people that are out to steal your unit have on hand. ya got this lock that they say is tamper proof. so someone messes with it and now you cant even unlock it tell you get help. so you have to leave it cause you got to be somewhere like class or work. and now your not in a very good mood.Now that I have one of these I am a bit confused.  Everybody is talking about the cable and the lock and I saw where nobody mentioned the fact that this whole thing is tied to this little T shaped piece of steel that is stuck in this thin piece of either aluminum or plastic and all you have to do is grap it. pull up or down on the lock and it pulls right out with little effort.  Sure. laptop is a little damaged. but the guy who just stole yours doesnt care one bit.As I said in another review. how do I know this. well. I stuck it in my ProBook 4730s which is the thin aluminum type on the side and when I picked it up wrong and grapped it by the lock. the weight of the laptop alone was enough to pull this thing right out. and all I had to do is tap the side of the laptop a bit to bend it back and you really cant even tell it was damaged.If you want to protect your unit. dont walk away from it. and as for this lock idea. it looks good to those that are not out to steal yours. but a joke to those that are.This lock design will slow down a theif about 5 seconds at the most. so if your 6 seconds away from yours. its gone.PSu003ethis is the only bad review I have written. so keep that in mind if you decide to check this lock thing out with buying one.,1,0,1771

AC371UZBZ2P8Q,33,I was looking for an AMFM radio that could pull in distant AM stations. especially for baseball broadcasts. at least as well as the radios in my two carswhich work pretty well.  I had hopes for this model .mine is branded GE. but its the same as the RCA version.. but it has been rather disappointing.  This is a good radio for listening to local news and other talk radio. and it puts out substantial if not refined sound for listening to music on FM. so its particularly good for when Im working outdoors or in the garage.  Unfortunately. its not easy to tune distant AM stations precisely. and the unilluminated tuning display is difficult to read in dim light.  Battery life with this radio seems to be very good. one of the best features of this model.  It also seems to be fairly sturdy. having survived a 3 ft. fall to the floor.  When it comes to AM radio reception. there are probably a few better models on the marketat least I hope there arebut they will probably cost more.  If cost is not a big issue. a radio that has an illuminated digital tuning display. along with equal or better reception. should be more satisfying.,3,0,1135
AC402JMEPWYY0,11,I didnt buy this modem through Amazon. I got it at a Yahoo auction for  9.99 including shipping. I installed it with no problems with the drivers  cd. It seems to be working fine.

AC5SFTVHX1P04,22,This is the perfect size and it was exactly what I needed.  It was also 15 the price of what the nearby shack chain wanted!  With free shipping. how could I pass it up?  BTW  I did not know that the missing pin 9 is normal for almost all null modem adapters.  A nice reply from the seller and some followup research confirmed it. so dont let it scare you when you see it!,5,1,371
AC63G8TNC9UMO,22,Ive bought Sony shower radios for 20 years  this is the third .and by far the best. model. and Ive had at least one of all three models.  The digital tuning is essential  you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station.  I love the presets. and listening to 60 Minutes and similar TV shows is great.  The solid base means its less likely to fall over. or off of things.  The radio is pretty tough  Ive dropped it and had nothing happen. but once the AM antenna broke and that was that for talk radio.  And the batteries really do seem to last forever!  On the one I have now .five years old.. the plastic waterproof top is cracking. and the FM antenna caught on something and pulled loose.  So. Im buying another.  Dont EVER stop making this radio. Sony!,5,1,768

AC752I0GPJ972,67,I bought the Advent 770 after going to Best Buy and trying on the various models they had there. I found this model to be the most comfortable at the store so I bought them from Amazon. I wear them at work for hours at a time  and even though I wear glasses. I am always comfortable. Other headphones I  have worn compress my ears too muchbut this set does not. .A did not like  a Sony wireless headphone for that reason..There is some adjustment of  the controls .to match the frequency of the base and the headphones.  needed. but it does not bother me. It is very similar to changing channels  on a cordless phone. only it is an analog dial.I am very happy with the  product and I am considering buying a second pair for home use.,5,1,733

ACB7W3IU2DNAJ,0,... i found that this headphone is not what i thought about itafter reading about it on the net and the booklet included with theheadset at the first sight.According to the manual the range is 300feet. This is not true in the case of a scenario in which you use theheadphone with walls e.t.c between the transmitter and theheadphone. I placed the transmitter on the top floor of my house andthe sound quality was very good in the area of about 60 * 50 feet onmy top floor with concreate walls in between and wood doors. but wheni went downstairs. the real thing showed up. While moving around icould easily hear hissing sound which disappers when i stopwalking. Moreover the signal also became weak. I adjusted thefrequency from the headphone but of no use. So whats the use. even iwent up and changed the frequnency of the headphone and thetransmitter again. but when i came back same was the result. The soundbecomes louder when i came under the room in which i placed thetransmitter. Allover it showed variable sound and i was just about 30feet away from the transmitter with concrete walls in between.Thesecond thing is that i went in the opposite direction of the room onthe same floor in which i placed the transmitter and when i was about20 feet away with 2 concrete walls in between and many glass windows.the signal was over. I belive that the 300 feet range is a marketingstrategy or if its possible. its in an open space like a ground. In ahouse or through walls. its impossible.The headphone comes with 3NiCD. rechargable batteries which are placed in the headset and theheadphones are connected to the transmitter with a charging cable. Thetransmitter is then connected to the power outlet to charge theheadphones. The initial charge is 24 hours .Plays 5 to 6hours.. Average charge is 1012 hours .Plays 34 hours. and ExtendedCharge is 1618 hours .Plays 56 hours.. There is no indication of anytype that the batteries are being charged on both the headphones andthe transmitter.The headphones comes with Y cable adapter. ACadapter. charging cable and headohone adapter plug also. Theaccessories are enough to plug anywhere.This thing is made in Chinaand the quality is not bad. the headphones fit very easily and arecomfortable enough to fit over the ear but the grip of the headphonesover the head is not so tight. if you look down the headphones alsolooses some of its original location and they might fall from yourhead if you jerk your head down.The transmitter is very lightweight and its quality is not so good. moreover its not so powerful.but it works till the distance i have specified with very goodresults. The antenna of the transmitter is very light weight and itcan break easily if not proper care is taken.Over all theheadphones are of good quality material but not the transmitter.Therange is not 300. its about 70 to 90 feet .works very good in thisrange. with walls e.t.c in between and in an open space it ismore. The sound quality is very good if you are on the same floor ofthe transmitter but distorts if you go on different floor.The priceis high as compared to the product.Note. This is a totally clearreview of the product deflecting my own experience. I am not in theopposition of this company or product neither i have tried any otherwireless headphones of this or some other company. You may observe thefunctioning. quality e.t.c of the headphones as deviated from theresults which i have written in this review.,3,0,3452
ACCUPJZUVRNT1,44,My friend bought this thing and wanted me to come check it out.  I did.  It doesnt even get close to 48x .7.2 mbsec..  Then the tray BENT whenever I put a cd in or took one out.  That really was not good since I am worried for my PC game loving friend that his CD drive is gonna go kapoot on him.  Also. the CDs get really HOT  in there.  This doesnt have advanced reading technology or anything. it  just spins faster.  This is REALLY bad for a CD because the heat .I almost  burned myself on a CD. can cause the data area to become warped and you  will lose your softwareaudio cd that is in the drive.  Look elsewhere for  a CD drive!,1,0,636
ACCUPJZUVRNT1,3132,This is just a MD player.  I want you to make sure that you understand that this does NOT have the recording of minidiscs built into it.  If you do not have a recorder at home you are going to have a useless player.  As  for the system here. its great. it sounds good. and its got a remote  control .that you will not end up using. it fits in a pocket..  However. if  you are looking for a recorderplayer or just a better player. go to your  local electronics store and pick up the Sharp MDMT15.  It is by far the  best minidisc playerrecorder on the face of the planet. great sound  quality. great support. easy recording. and lots of great features. even  fast play and monorecording for double the storage on a minidisc.

ACDAP6S2SCBEL,111,This operated as advertised.  Its quite small .a bit bigger than a hockey puck. and light .no batteries.. which made it a little hard to make it stay put in some cases.

ACDUPC4QGE99F,23,Our office used to use a handful of the EN104 4port hubs and some of the EN108 .the 8port version of the same product..As 10 Mbps hubs go. the EN104s are really nice.The quality of NetGear equipment has always impressed me.  Nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic.  Status indicators built into the jacks. so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active.  Rightangled barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally.  With an easytoaccess switch. Port 1 toggles between station mode and uplink mode.  Unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together. this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink.  Screwmount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall. underside of a counter. etc.If you want to set up a network without spending much. these hubs work well.  However. I suggest you buy a 10100 Mbps hub instead.Heres why.Practically all new networkable devices today support 100 Mbps .FastEthernet. as well as 10 Mbps .Ethernet..  The EN104 hub .and other 10 Mbps hubs. will limit you to the slower speed.As 10100 Mbps hubs are readily available today. and are quite affordable. I think your money is better spent on the faster hub.Is there a noticeable difference between 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps?  It depends on your usage. but if you regularly work with files larger than about 300 KBytes or larger. youll notice a tangible difference.  For truly large files .like graphicsmovies. or when installing an application via a network drive.. a 10 second transfer at 100 Mbps will take well over a minute at 10 Mbps.If the NetGear 10100 hub .DS104. is a bit too pricey for you. you might consider the Linksys EFAH05W 10100 hub.  Though not as u0026quotniceu0026quot as NetGear equipment. the Linksys 10100 hub is only a few dollars more than this NetGear 10 Mbps hub.,4,1,1869
ACDUPC4QGE99F,5759,Our office used to use a handful of the EN108 8port hubs and some of the EN104 .the 4port version of the same product..As most of the NetGear equipment line. the EN108s are really nice.

Unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together. this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink. Screwmount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall. underside of a counter. etc.Rather than buying this 10Mbps hub. however. I strongly suggest that you buy a 10100 Mbps hub.  Your interest in buying an 8port hub suggests that you have an activelyused network.  If so. youll most likely benefit from higher networking speeds.Is there a noticeable difference between 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps? It depends on your usage. but if you regularly share larger files with your coworkers. .about 300 KBytes or larger.. youll notice a tangible difference.

ACDY0KLN8GAGL,33,LG 420G is an LG cell phone by tracfone with proprietary firmware.The usb connect function is not available on the phone or from tracfone.Bluetooth is the only connection available. Found this out after purchasing the cable.The cable itself works fine. recharges the phone from the pc or laptop usb port.which can be a good asset for many users. especially for the price. Cable may also fit other phones.USB drivers are not easy to find and when loaded and working. it actually sees the phonebut as the phone cant connect. its not much use. Bluetooth will let you downloadthe pictures you take with the camera phone but not much else. Picture messages you received.I havent been able to figure out yet. Dont think you can use bluetooth. and remember thatit only works with one picture at a time. Very tedious and time consuming.The last alternative to read and save data from this phone. which I havent tried yet.is to use a SIM card reader. Remove card from phone. put into reader and plugin to usband use appropriate software.  Lots of programs and cables being sold out there listingthis phone. but when you dig deep enough. youll find the fine print.Dont waste your time. I already did.,3,0,1190

ACFD835MECTRC,22,Over the last years I went from a Nokia Communicator PhonePda. to a Nec Mobile Pro 400 Windows CE and ultimately to a Palm V .actually Palm III  with a V upgrade.. I must say the Palm isnt my favourite among the above  mentionned PDAs.On the Plus side.The interface is very pleasant to  use. it is small in size and easy to write while standing .unlike keyboard  devices.. the hot sync synchronizes seemlessly with your address book.  email etc and there are many software available as well as website where  you can subscribe to channels or download information straight to the  Palm.On the minus side.Although it is  a nice device to keep diary  and track of your expenses etc.. the lack of keyboard means that to enter  any long piece of text is laborious. Consequently. it you are expecting  from your Pda to be able to. say type an email or some notes while on the  road. this is the wrong device. There are many software around but if you  examine it more closely. many are not very powerful. For instance. I was  very pleased to be able to download a map from mapquest. but without the  ability to zoom or search the map it is of limited use.  Palm users are  often excited by the possibility of downloading email from the inbox. With  my previous Nokia communicator. I could download .and send. email from the  internet using my regular ISP .Unlike Palm VII which requires a proprietary  system subscription. so to download emails from my PC only fails to appear  as a very useful to me. I was also irritated by the fact that by default.  it download all emails in the inbox folder of outlook while synchronizing  which I had to delete one by one.  I know it is possible to buy a keyboard  but the keyboard being too large to be carried. I dont see the point of  that.Conclusion.If you like elegant and simple to use devices .i.e.  if you are a Mac user for instance. the Palm may be for you. especially if  you intend to use it mostly to keep your address book and diary.  If you  seek a PDA also to type notes. use interactive maps and generally expect  more than a electronic diary. I would recommend a Psion. Windows CE or the  wonderful and versatile Nokia Communicator phone.,3,0,2189
ACFVAVHGJ25XQ,1717,.Update. May 19. 13. I dropped two stars off of this product review as I found that it doesnt meet what the seller advertises this as. which is. outperforms the original. It definitely never comes close to what SONYs original charging cable manages to do  super quick charge. I doubt that this product is really sold by Sony here..Old. Original Review.This cable arrived much earlier than what was said which came as a surprise. The length of this cable is longer than the original one I got with my Xperia ION. To give the readers a fair idea. it is as long as Sony or Philips earphones. The diameter of the cable is about 4mm. From the two pictures provided here on Amazon. I thought it was going to be thicker. I would like to think it is thick enough to not get tangled up. Overall. I am happy with this purchase.,3,0,817
ACGC5PM64LQ8Y,0,The Nook is soooooo close to being a great product.  The promise is that users can download digital books easily from the public library. but it is NOT true.  The Adobe Reader software makes this a cumbersome and frustrating task.  Very very disappointing. The reason I purchased this was to leverage public library as well as purchased books.  I feel like I was tricked.  The only saving grace is that the screen is very nice and once books are loaded on the device .if you miraculously get them there. it is great to use.  Based on the complexity of downloading. I wouldnt recommend this device.  Good luck getting any tech support from Adobe or Barnes and Noble either.,2,0,672

Its not repairable unless you disassemble the cartridge. and the cartridge isnt easily disassembled without breaking it..I dont blame the vendor. I blame Brother..Next time.

ACM682HDLBCHX,2,For some reason. this device requires power and data to be supplied by different cables. even if the USB port supplying the data can definitely supply sufficient power.  It works most reliably if the power is plugged in first.  Ridiculous design.,2,0,246

ACOMNCF0Q0U5X,45,I recently purchased two of these Rio500 MP3 players. one for my girlfriend and one for myself. and theyre without a doubt a godsend for anyone who loves to listen to music. or shall I say digital quality music on the go  without the annoying skips and shuffles associated with  portable CD and yes even MD players.The Rio500 is a marvelous little  unit. and when I mean little  I mean tiny! Its about the size of a pack  of cigarettes and almost half a packs thickness. Its rugged yet simple  looks and userfriendly design makes it ideal for even the entrylevel MP3  enthusiast. Sound quality and sheer power of the unit is among the highest  that I have heard among the other MP3 players on the market. The onboard  64MB and expansion capabilities also makes it one of the most powerful in  terms of memory u0026quotin its price rangeu0026quot of all the players.With  all that good. unfortunately I also think it has one small flaw. I found  the included KOSS ear bud headphones to be of very poor quality and  extremely uncomfortable to use. Although it may not be a huge imperfection.  I do believe it affects the overall standing of the unit. As you dont  achieve the sound quality that it states it can produce. I found the use of  a set of headphones I had from an old Sony CD Walkman worked amazing well.  You can purchase equivalent headphone from Sony or most any other brand  name audio manufacturer for anywhere from USD15. to USD20.Other than that.  the Rio500 is a great buy. u0026quotif you get it from Amazon.com for .a great price.. that isu0026quot Both my girlfriend and I love it. and were positive  that you will too..,5,1,1640

ACPB6HD9U1QB1,0,If I had known what a headache this was going to be. I would have never purchased it in the beginning. The more I use it. the more I hate it.Pros. There is a nice selection of books and magazines offered by Bu0026NCons.This thing freezes like it is its job. Every time I have the web browser open. it freezes and I cannot do anything  with it until I restart the whole deviceThe Nook Tablet has a nasty habit of shutting down on its own or restarting itself. even when there is a full chargeThe selection of apps is terrible. I know the Nook tablet is fairly new..but Id expect something better than knock off versions of popular current appsA very limited amount of storage space. Even with using a memory card there just isnt enough room for multiple books. magazines. and appsTake my advice. its not worth your money or your time.,1,0,833

ACSCECQJQNT5I,12,As a microphone this thing works fine. However if you are trying to turn your itouch into a skype phone forget it as the volume on itouch just isnt loud enough. I have found out that the only way to use the itouch as s skype phone is to use the headphones that include a mic. And then if you have skype in. forget it because you will never hear the thing ring. But the mic works and it is little money.,2,0,402
ACSYXU72Z73M4,11,I have used the MDMS 722 since December of 1999 in my role as a  reporteranchor at Clear Channel Radio in Wyoming.  It is a marvelous piece  of equipment that has been reliable whether recording city council  meetings. doing interviews or even scrambling after firefighters in the  Wyoming mountains.  It fits in my front left pants pocket and the only  thing that would make it better for me would be to have a built  in...professional quality...microphone.  I am an u0026quotold guyu0026quot and I  love the digital quality and convenience.  Its an A+ for professional  applications.  Plus 149 minutes on a disc in mono is to die for! The  lithium ion rechargable battery is wonderful...with a long recording life  and a quick recharge when its only partly discharged.,5,1,770

ACUJOFGFVSMTH,1,I took a look at a few other customer reviews and noticed a lot of the same problems u0026quotlipsyncu0026quot.  I am rather amazed that a company like Sony would continue to producerelease a product and simple not fix the  problem in their factories.  As you can see from a lot of reviews on this  page. this is a continuing problem.As a gift from my wife this year  for Christmas. I was so excited I rushed out an rented two DVDs early that  morning.  What can I say...AWESOME!  The picture was perfect. the sound was  amazing. what more could someone want?It was around the middle of  January and about four to six DVDs later that I started to notice this  weird problem.  At first I thought...hmmmm...must be the DVD. then it  started to happen again and again.  One Saturday. my wife and I decided to  visit the store where she purchased it in December.  I asked one of the  electronics specialists about the u0026quotlipsyncu0026quot problem and  immediately got an answer.  u0026quotbring it in and Sony will fix the problem  for freeu0026quot. he said.  Well. I dont know about anyone else but this has  become the best feature of my home theatre system and I dont think it fair  that I have to give it up for two or three weeks. while someone fixes a  problem that should have been fixed earlier. Not to mention the amount of  money she paid for it .USD750.00 Can...I am an avid Sony buff and this is  really disappointing.  I hope each of you will review this product in great  detail and ask a lot of questions before you decide to purchase it.Good  luck!,1,0,1566

ACVACAN9F8XKR,0,I have used this device for over a year.  It is an acceptable GPS device but loses the logging function whenever it is turned off.  To enable logging. you then have to use the computer software to enable it.  This makes it useless as logger unless you set it and immediately use it.  If you turn it off. it loses the data.  I have returned it to Delorme for service and was assured it functions perfectly.  I assume they are referrring to the GPS function.  It is no better than a paper weight as a logger.  If you want one. buy mine.  Delorme turned me down when I offered to sell it to them at half price.,1,0,607

ACZ7LEL5BHIK5,88,I bought this radio as a portable CB that I can take on my motorcycle. I used it on my 800 mile automobile trip to Florida right after it arrived. It has an adaptor that you can plug into the cigarette lighter and an outside CB antenna. I attached my Wilson 500 antenna for my trip. I got decent fidelity and about a 2 mile range. Its not as good as my big Cobra radio. but it worked sufficiently for this trip and I will buy the matching headset when I bring it with me on my Honda Magna motorcycle rides.,3,0,506

AD2F67ICNR023,1114,My wifes Kindle Fire exceeds this tablet in all capabilities.  I own a Nook Tablet and I wish I had bought a different tablet.  The Nook app store is pathetic. not to mention that most apps that are free for androids cost money on the Nook store.  If streaming video from Youtube. this tablet has a tendency to freeze up. the internet has shut down on me many times while checking emails.  This tablet also does NOT allow third party application downloads.  One good thing that this tablet had was a predownloaded Netflix app. which had quit working.  So basically. this socalled tablet is no different than an ereader.  If I could. I would have not purchased this tablet and saved my money for a better one. even the Kindle Fire.,1,0,730
AD39Y365FYIXM,0,I HAVE TWO OF THESE.  THE FIRST PLAYER HAS BEEN A WORK HORSE FOR MANY YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS.  I PURCHSED THE SECOND PLAYER AS A BACKUP AND IT WORKS EXCELLENT.

AD47HQAOB7WVD,0,I like mine a lot. it never skips on the bus or in my pocket even with esp off .i almost never use esp. it has great features. but i dont have time to do a full review and list them all. It reads scratched cds and cdrs  well. The lid is a bit loose and it skips for no reason at all every once  in a while. These are my only complaints. Ive had it for about 4 months.  and the skipping problems has gone away a little bit. and the lid hasnt  gotten any looser.,4,1,460
AD4W2SI6ES4XE,44,I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR USE WHILE RIDING MY MOTORCYCLE. THE SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING AFTER A COUPLE OF TRIPS BUT THANKS TO THE SPEAKER MIC I ADDED. I AM ABLE TO CONTINUE USING IT. MY FRIEND PURCHASED THE SAME RADIO AND HAS NOT HAD ANY SPEAKER PROBLEMS. WE ALSO ADDED AN EXPANDABLE ANTENNA FOR MORE RANGE. THESE ARE GOOD RADIOS BUT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR CLOSE COMMUNICATION.,4,1,374
AD4XKDR0MD7JO,22,The radio seems good at first but they dont hold up to longterm use in the shower. Ive had two of these which have died after several months of use. and am trying a different brand instead.,2,0,189
AD4XKDR0MD7JO,22,For the price this is a great tablet. It lacks a camera. GPS. and bluetooth. but that still leaves a lot. between web browsing and running lots of Android apps. Barnes and Noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but I did get around that by rooting mine.That said. I was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by Amazon today. The newer version is faster. has a higher resolution screen. is lighter despite same screen size. and has bluetooth. .Still no camera or GPS.. Bu0026N also is now allowing access to the Google Play Store. It is available on the newer version but I dont know if they updated the software for this one to allow access. I suspect they didnt but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing. checking email. ebooks. video. and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend. then it isnt a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer versionthe Nook HD. .They also make a version with a larger screen. the HD+.Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a cardpossibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet .but rooting is more work than inserting a card.. The HD works well off a rooted Jelly Bean card.,4,1,1561
AD50TWQOM8W4G,0,This controller really became valuable to me after the first 3 or 4 viewing sessions with my new ETX90EC.  After the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off. the controller  assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at. It took some  work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller.  I had to  learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope.  Once I learned the reference stars. the unit becomes essential for me to  really enjoy this hobby.  I cannot imagine using my telescope without this  controller!,5,1,603
AD50TWQOM8W4G,7178,This prism is needed if you intend to use your telescope for terrestrial viewing and photograpy.  If you do not use it. your image will be inverted.,5,0,148
AD50TWQOM8W4G,7172,I bought this tripod with my telescope.  I would have been really disapointed if I didnt.  Without this tripod you need to set the ETX90EC on a sturdy support such as a table. The tripod prevents excessive shake  when viewing the stars or planets.  Without the shake the planets and stars  are clear.  With the shake the appear blury.  The higher the magnification  you use. the steadier the tripod needs to be.  This tripod has a nice cast  iron head.  It is really solid.  It also support Polar alignment or AltAz  alignment.  I would not purchase the ETX90EC without it!,5,1,573
AD50TWQOM8W4G,6265,I am truly an amateur astronomer.  My childhood was peppered with dimestore telescopes that showed me a new blurry world.  When I got the EXT90EC I expected little more than a brighter blur.  To my surprise and  delight I was wrong.  Out of the box. in bad lighting conditions.  surrounded by trees. I saw some of the most breathtaking images of the  moon.  In fact. I spent the next six hours observing the moon.  I saw  craters in detail.  I even saw some craters within craters.  I did venture  to a bright star I saw in the sky.  It turned out to be Jupiter.  It was a  highly recognizable Jupiter.  Not another dot in the sky.  I could see  three of Jupiters moons in orbit.  I couldnt even make out Jupiters  moons with the naked eye.I tried the telescope during the day for  terrestrial viewing.  Once again I was pleasantly surprised!  The local  river area came alive with wildlife.  The photographic possibilities are  endless!I purchased the 883 Deluxe field tripod. 932 45 Degree  Erecting Prism. 497 Autostar controller. and the 774 hard case with the  telescope.  I highly recommend you do the same.  They all add to the total  experience.  The tripod is a must for both astrological and terrestrial  viewing.  The 45 Degree Erecting Prism is needed for terrestrial viewing.  If you dont use it. your images will be inverted.  The autostar. once  aligned. will position the telescope to any viewable object. and then  continue to track it.  The case is a convenience and insurance policy.,5,1,1502
AD78M6QTIWSCM,2112,This is a really good player. Its sounds cool. looks O.K.. and spins my C.D.s well. I hardly ever skips. and I use it for my daily bike rides.

ADAXXCMSLC0U9,0,This product DOES NOT WORK on the Iconia A100. the product title is misleading. The A100 is a tablet for starters. not a smartphone. Second. it charges with an AC Adapter.

ADCQVT1CUTA5F,118,I have always used the Apple Newton Message Pad 2000. but the size and weight has forced me to look elsewhere. From my several years of experience using a PDA. I have found that at the most I use the PDA as an address book  and scheduler. Every where I travel these days. I can get internet  connection. so I do no need internet connection on my PDA to check  mail.Overall  Palm V is an excellent productCons.1. The backlight  leaves much to be desired. I just cannot get used to it when I compare it  with the Newton.  2. The screen is very reflective. 3. It lacks a few  polished applications such as a world clock. a currency converter. even the  built in country list is incomplete. Example no mention of any middle east  countries where I am currently working as a consultant. The expense program  leaves much to be desired. 4. No built in modem 5. No voice recorder 6.  Leather cover is cheap and detracts the overall quality of the  product.Pros.1. Weight and size  five star here! 2. Clarity of text  excellent under full light. 3. Graifiti gives better accuracy than the  newton free style writing. 4. Hot Sync works with Microsoft Outlook!   nothing short of briliant 5. Long battery life ie when fully charged 6.  Single base unit for charger and hotsync.I bought my unit in England and  as such the adaptor is auto voltage! and comes complete with different plug  adaptors.,4,1,1385

ADEU4RN9QJA0,11,The best thing about this is the design. but the arms connecting the screen and keyboard look odd when the unit is closed.  The screen is fairly dim. and must be used in a darkmoderately lit room.  The viewing angle of the screen is horrible the only position you can see the whole screen without an inversionblackout effect is at an angle where any overhead lighting glares all over the place.  The CPU speed isnt particularly slow. but the graphics ..re.drawing the screen. goes on at an awful crawl  i.e. its no good for graphical things.  Now I must sound entirely bitter and biased against this machine. but Im not. I carry it in my bag all the time and use it when I can.  I even use it as an electronic book. its best use so far.,3,0,736
ADEVKOLZYNY1C,22,Ive tried few japanese brands before I ended up with the Harman Kardons HK3270 Receiver. At first. I thought 35WattsChannel was too little. but these are real 35 Watts RMS. not High power Watts like advertised by japanese brands. It is as much if not more powerful than any 100W Jap amplifier on the market. Ive tried it with 4 Cerwin vega! speakers. and even at max volume. it is still precise with no distortion .Very noisy though!!..  The sound is great. the interface is extremely simple .Volume. balance. Bass. Treble and source. Thats all!. No gadgets to boost you bass or to alter your sound. Its just plain simple but very efficient with lots of output power. The only problem is the tuner .It doesnt work very well! you need a big antenna or a cable connection if you want to use it... So. if youre not looking for gadgets but only for great sound . This receiver is for you!,4,1,884
ADGJASX9BZEW,1415,First.let me say that Amazon Customer Service has been GREAT at helping to work out the problem here with my new S550D and the sync problem.  I am very impressed with Amazon Customer Service and they deserve some good words.  Five stars to them. Sony Customer Service is another story.You  might want to check out the following URL for all the details on the  u0026quotsyncu0026quot problem.  Reports here seem to indicate that corrected  units may now be shipping but I have seen no official confirmation of  that.I like the unit and  have always liked Sony products.

ADHUDKD3OVX71,1315,This camera takes great pictures and is easy to understand and use. It has a MAJOR drawback though. and I may be returning this camera and buying a different one. The drawback.... It EATS batteries !  A set of Heavy Duty  Alkalines will barely last 20 minutes .even with the LCD display turned  off..! I bought two sets of 1200 MA rechargeable batteries from Radio Shack  plus a quick charger .USD60 worth.. and can barely get one set recharged  before the other runs down. Dont count on being able to fill up your 8Meg  flashcard AND download pictures on the same set of batteries!A second  NECESSITY is the AC Adapter. Without this accessory. battery life becomes  even more of a problem. This should be a standard feature with this  camera.We own a Toshiba and a Sony. and neither one of them consumes  power like the Olympus.,2,0,829

ADI7BZD8D6NR6,0,I didnt realize that my Plantronics earpiece just required a regular micro USB cable so I ordered this one here. Charging of the earpiece works as expected. However. I just tried this cable with another micro USB device I just got. a  Lightning to micro USB adapter  for my iPhone 5 and the cable does not properly work with that. The iPhone adapter works properly with another micro USB cable I got in the meantime.Three stars because it does what it claims but if I want to use just one cable to charge both my iPhone as well as my earpiece I cannot use this cable. Why not just make it .or sell. a regular USB cable?,3,0,619
ADIA0K5LUGSYF,0,This battery. like other rechargable batteries I own. is rated for 8.4 volts and Im told is likely even less.  Why not go with Maha?

I can only imagine that a battery with a rating which conforms to a devices designated power requirements. is better across the board.,1,0,380
ADICXIFYB2DI1,56,I am very pleased with the Maxell tapes. Even in SLP .EP. mode they have a very clear picture and sound.

ADIOJ35TO3H4M,33,This is a beautiful crystal lady bug flash drive.  But. it didnt last a week before it started to fall apart.  Instead of wearing it as a necklace. I tried attaching it to a key ring.  The metal was too soft and it broke.  It stored information but it was not well made.,3,0,270
ADJ9A25IUUY,0,I was looking for a way to get old documents and photos off of about 60 floppies I had in a box.  I had stored the documents and photos on the floppies on a 1996 windows pc. and now I have a mac.  Additionally there were more photos and docs on the 96 machine that I wanted to save.  I wasnt sure if or how this would work.  The information provided didnt make me feel very confident.  However the price was right. and I took a chance.  Overall it worked very well.  My goal here is to comment on the Sabrent floppy drive as well as explain what I did to recover all these documents and photos.  Im probably not the only one who let too much time go by without taking care of this sort of situation.First of all. I could have given the Sabrent drive 5 stars. but I chose to give it 4 because of a few issues.  The instructions that came with it seem to only apply to windows machines.  Would it really hurt to provide a little more helpful information?!?!?  It is plug and play with my mac. but not always.  Sometimes Id plug it in and it would make a grinding noise indicating it was ready to read a disk.  Sometimes it only made a humming sound. and Id have to unplug it. wait. replug it in and try again.  Sometimes I had to restart my mac to get it to work.  Sometimes I was able to get through several disks in a row without any trouble.  So it was temperamental. and thats why the 4 star rating.  I must admit Im very grateful that it did work because Id forgotten about many of the photos.  I was extremely happy to recover them again!  It was like opening a time capsule!  So please take this into consideration.  There are several floppy drives available and I have no idea how well they work.  In hindsight. based on my results. I would recommend buying this floppy drive.  Just know that youll need to invest some time and patience.The following is meant to be helpful to anyone faced with a similar situation.  My old 96 laptop still worked. but it didnt have USB. and was only dialup.  So I had no way to connect it to a printer. the internet. or another computer.  I was able to put everything I wanted from the old laptop on floppies and move them to my mac with the assistance of the Sabrent floppy drive.  Most of the photos were jpegs. and they transferred just fine.  I was able to put them right in iPhoto with no trouble.  Most of the docs were created in Word 95. and Apple doesnt support that anymore.  Google Drive can read just about anything.  So I moved the docs from the floppy drive to folders in Google Drive on my mac. and they opened just fine.  Some of the formatting didnt transition so well with old resumes. but I dont care about that.  All in all there were only about 2 or 3 documents I was never able to open. and I was OK with that.  I consider this project a longoverdue success.,4,1,2820

ADL6MYT9GVHJT,33,I bought this model last year to switch between my HP Laser and Canon color ink jet. Its great  very easy to switch back and forth. easy to hook up.

ADOODN6SRJZU,0,However says that the Nook is the cheapest tablet out thier and the best well you are wrong  . It is not a good tablet . In fact I have used one and hate it . Hate it . And if you are an expert on tablets like me well you cant even call it that . How can call this a tablet when it is only made of rubber . wire and a screen . Another thing that makes a tablet goood is . please not im doing this from a Kindle Fire point of a view . that you can have apps . books . music and videos . Does the Nook allow any of this ? Nope except the book part . It is also very weak . You stop using it and you must charge it . I hope my review keeps everybody away from this tablet . opps .. Once again Barnes and Nobles fails to compete .,1,0,726
ADOR3TR7GDF68,12,Hey. I am a music professional. I make many recordings and service equipment so I know whats going on in the world!This disc has a 18th  by 18th  piece of felt glued to a blank CD. I could have done that but I wanted PROFESSIONAL!Again. 18th  x 18th . if you look on the internet it even tells you how to make these. Because the lens moves you need the felt to be the entire distance of the CD plus on both side for balance. However this is a tiny dot. You would have to leave it in the player for a week in order for it to clean the lens correctly. Shame On You Maxell... Shame Shame!,1,0,585
ADP9OKUYOSYCW,34,The styli are of sufficient quality for me to be satisfied with them .= they work.. but I have two complaints about this product . The product is said to be u0026quotsame as stylus provided with productu0026quot and a u0026quotgenuine Palm quality productu0026quot. It is neither. These styli do not fit the silo perfectly and the screws at the top and bottom are badly made. in contrast to the perfect screws and silo fitting of those that were provided with the product. The price is excessive. Why should a simple piece of mass produced plastic cost over three U.S.USDs. especially considering the mediocre quality of the product ?,4,1,634
ADQG79SS5N72A,11,I bought this modem because I recently installed Linux .Mandrake 8.0 kernel 2.4.3. on my laptop. Since my laptop had shipped with a Winmodem I needed to find a modem that would work. I read the customer reviews and noticed that one said it installed easily on his Linux system. It does! However. I needed to do two things. 1.. go to Zooms website. There I found simple installation instructions for Linux in their tech support section and 2..install a program called u0026quotminicomu0026quot which was on my Linux installation CD. In all. I think this took me about 10 minutes. including going on the web and printing the instructions! Very simple! The modem functions superbly under Linux!,5,1,691
ADRAS4BZRQAXN,34,If you are like me and find yourself with a surround system cobbled together from a collection of amplifiers and speakers. but dont have a good way to bring it all together...look no further!  Dont replace all those amps with an u0026quotall in one boxu0026quot surround system just because its a hassle balancing all those descrete channels...The Signature 2.0 processortunerpreamp is just what you need.  It has an analog 6 channel input for your DVD Audio player. digital inputs. optical inputs. Svideo outputs. its all here...  And talk about quiet?  This preamp is absolutely silent.  Maximum flexibility in assigning inputs. no changing cables. just reroute them via menu .onscreen or front panel. control!The onboard processors are as smooth as silk. and the builtin effects .to add surround depth to stereo CDs. are subtle and never gimmicy.  HK spent alot of time on this one!  It is super.There is only one thing about this unit that I have to work around...the remote sensor in the front panel is rather narrow sighted and I find myself almost out of range a fair part of the timewhos living room is a perfect listening room? I will have to add an IR remote sensor to compensate.Please note that this is a deep cabnet. and it is heavy.  Overengineered it seems. since the power supply is clearly big enough to handle the consumption of this unit.The perfect solution for those of you who want to use a couple of stereo systems in combination for a surround sound system!  You will love it!,5,1,1500
ADRNQL7E7VDE4,33,The 980 is easy to assemble and install with suction cups on your windshield. I drive a lot through heavily patrolled twisty mountain roads so you usually see cops too late or not at all. The 980 picks up the signal just before the signal strength increases and you actually see the cop. Most of what I see of real police radar is Ka band. so thats what I monitor. and avoids the unit from going off constantly with interfering singals from nonradar activity.,4,1,459
ADS062CN1SCN4,55,Our office has been urging us to use Microsoft Outlook Planner Scheduler to schedule all of our meetings and appointments.  I was originally keeping appointments in the old Franklin Day Planner.  However. there was no way to synchronize the Franklin Planner with the Outlooks scheduler. hence I  missed a lot of meetings.  The Palm V has been an excellent tool to  coordinate this.I looked at the Psions. however. they were very big and  cumbersome as compared to the Palm V.  Size does matter.If I wanted a  laptop. I would have gotten one..  The compact size of the Palm V is a  major benefit and the fact that it synchronizes with my PC makes this  great.I have several problems with it however.  The first is when the  Palm V is in my pocket. the cover sometimes closes on the buttons on the  front and you hear a clicking sound.  I am sure this kills the battery. let  alone annoying.  I have looked into a hard case. but now you start to get  back into the larger size issue.  The other problem I have had with the  Palm V is that the touch sensitive screen has lost its u0026quottouchu0026quot.  It got to the point where I could not even use the Palm V at all. It was  not responsive to any touch of the stylus.  It just locked up.  I  eventually had to reboot and it seemed to have cured the problem. but it is  slower than when I first purchased it and still is erratic in its touch  repsonse.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I have almost gotten to the  point where I have quit using it.  Maybe the Psion will win  out?Overall. I think it is a helluva tool. as long as it works!,3,0,1593
ADTV1DC1Q5UJU,2223,I researched and looked for 2 YRS for a GPS for driving ~ there were very specific things i wanted in a GPS.  i finally found what it in the SPIII ~ and the SPIII has delivered and thensome.Display is usually an issue.  SPIIIs terrific display resolution and layout make it easy to view and easy to find the information you want quickly.  There is also daynight mode so that the display is appropriate for the lighting conditions outside.The MENU is extremely easy to use and there are so many options ~ it will be rare that somebody can NOT get this thing to work exactly the way they want.  From display and layout options. to map detail options. to calculation vs best route preference. to fastest vs shortest routes. to preference for avoiding TOLL routes and UTURNs. to selecting route more appropriate for TRUCKS. CARS. etc. .Im assuming height limitations..Friend and I even discussed things the SPIII is not designed for. but can easiliy be useful for ~ like camping.  imagine parking. saving your parking location as a WAYPOINT ~ then being able to hike anywhere for any distance and not worry about how to find your car on your return hike .by routing to the saved WAYPOINT and selecting OFFROAD..  Pretty cool huh?  And againn. SPIII is not even designed for that really.I cant recommend this little machine enough.  As somebody who was already quite directionsavvy. its still been an extremely useful tool .my favorite.  avoiding traffic by finding alternative freeway onramps when leaving sporting events. musical events. etc..  Just route to your destination waypoint... drive away from the traffic. and let SPIII figure out how to get you u0026quothomeu0026quot from there.  for that alone ~ its a terrific tool!Happy and safe driving!P.S.  Just incase some people are wondering.. I do not work for GARMIN or any entity that sells GARMIN products.  Im just an extremely satisfied customer that found the perfect tool after a 2 yr search.,5,1,1952
ADUHS9CWACC4H,33,I always thought Sony was a superior electronics company.  That may have been true. but its certainly not now. The last cd player I had was a Sony Sport. and it worked perfectly.  The problem was that it was never designed  to read cdr discs.  I purchased this new groovy looking cd player. which  was supposed to be the newest thing. and it worked worse than my two year  old player.  It didnt read discs very well. couldnt read a cdr disc. and  barely had esp function.  I returned mine and got a panasonic. works great.  Ill have to do better research in the future. or buy from a store with a  return period.  I did that with the last sony television I bought and am I  glad I did it.,1,0,688
ADUQQINUG4STK,11,I my self have recently perchesed a RIO and can say it is so much better than a MD because its worth ever penney. Think of it this way. an MD is bout USD250.recordable.. The Rio is only USD100 right now. It is true the MD  can play more songs. but at that price youd most likely be to scared to  take it anywhere for fear of breaking it.  For example if you where to go  bike tiding and it fell or somthin. not a big loss. USD100 compared to the  MD. USD250 gone. You do the math. And also. unless you got the stuff. with  the MD youll still have to buy CDs. unlike wiht the RIO,5,1,578
ADUW2K229RD1C,14,What was I thinking when I bought these USD3.16 headphones!!?! they suck big time!!! Im planning to burn them along with all the evidence of the purchase.. look for better quality headphones somewhere else,1,0,205
ADV0EO4P34JNQ,66,Ok. here is the deal...these cannot be used as true surround sound speakers. They plug into the headphones jack and dont send a delayed signal. The delayed signal in dolby surround sound is what makes the Top Gun jet zoom behind you or in a 360 degrees..etc......They sounded pretty lame as well. I dont know why others had problems setting them up...it really wasnt that hard....you just adjust the signal.Id stay away from these unless you are desperate. Spend the extra USD100 and upgrade.,1,0,492
ADWUJZ8865J2A,510,Been having trouble with both my PC DVD drive and video recorder in getting a good clean start andor playrecord. Put this in today and followed instructions and after just 3045 seconds. removed the cleaner disc and tried some prerecorded discs that have given me trouble in the past. No problems now!!! everything I tried out started up lickety split and played perfectly. Probably saved me from ordering a new DVD drive for the PC. Should have had one of these discs months or years ago. Highly recommended.,5,1,508

ADX81OJF8C5CF,0,I am the occasional reader but. I bought this for tablet capability.  It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done. You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering Bu0026N store.  Its still there but. not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but. I prefer Dolphin HD.  Its much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus. when used as a reader. its just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making.  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldnt get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra USD and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but. I couldnt find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus. given their history I had decided against it.Good.Nice screen.  capacitive touch.  strong wifi. decent battery life. Nice CPU @ 800 MHz.  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly.. Tons of free apps available. very reasonably priced.  portable.  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at USD1 to USD3 an issue.. microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints..that silly plastic thing in the corner. mono speaker. micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot. doesnt come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances. randomly reboots instead of sleeping. wireless doesnt come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who havent rooted.  Im sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE.  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Nobles many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didnt succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriends and we have the same nook. that came with same firmware. that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasnt running AVG and mine was.  Its the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony. Microsoft. Nintendo. HTC .Sprint.. etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well. they wont be updating my firmware and now I wont be buying books from them either.  Anyway. its an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.Side Note.  I had ordered a touchpad from Bu0026N back on AUgust 21st.  Not only did I not get one. they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email.  Not very nice.,3,0,2899

ADXITJ6OUZT3L,0,I finally broke away from my 35mm Nikkon and decided to try a digital one...one draw back. the LCD screen is impossible to view in bright light. I had to move to shade or snap and hope they came out. I was able to view in the index at the pics to see if they turned out before I moved on which helped. There is a ev+1.5 to ev1.5 and a brightness control along with choice of event setting. I carry a few floppies disks with me and edit them at home...Overall. the cam is a great buy. even more so at the price I got it....Safe enough for the kids to use too!,4,1,558

ADY2P241W8PIE,22,If you have an integrated agp card in your motherboard. it doesnt compare to the power of this card! Having a Celeron @ 500 mhz. 96mb ram.

AE4YK5UFHWBDH,0,I returned my Kindle fire 8.9 after a single day due to no Google market.  A few days later I was at the mall with my girlfriend and I saw an add for the Nook hd and Nook Hd plus NOW WITH GOOGLE Market. It was enough to draw my attention in.  Once inside in saw another sign for the heavily reduced price tag on the Nook Hd and nook Hd plus. I thought man for the price of the one Kindle fire hd 8.9 I could get myself two of these nook hd with cases for about the same price.So thats what I did! I got my self the smoke .grey.  and my girlfriend a snow.white.  with two flip sleepwake cases for under 300USD. The screen is super nice full 1080p with the highest ppi on any tablet.  The only tablet that can compete Round the same price point is the nexus 7 and thats still 199USD.With the addition of the Google market they have turned their nook Hd into a full fledged android tablet for 129USD! That is a steal for a tablet this good.Beware of the 9 inch nook Hd plus.  Even though its the big brother of the 7 inch nook Hd it still has the same processor and it shows. The plus is sluggish while the7 inch is zippy with very few lag issues. Not sure why this but beware it is noticeable.Over all we love it! Nook Hd does everything the Kindle fire hd does for the e readers PLUS more with the addition of the Google play store.If you want to change the way the original nook operating system looks for a Google nexus 7 look then I would suggest the nova launcher in the play store. Cant go wrong with the Nook hd 7 inch for 129USD.,5,1,1535

AE6HAULG0UDDY,0,I bought my Rio about 2 months ago. It plays perfectly. and I have no complaints with the performance. But if you are going to take this with you as a truely u0026quotportableu0026quot unit you are going to be stuck with only  30 minutes of storage for cd quality music. Maybe thats not a problem for  you. but personally I need more of a variety of music when I take this on a  trip. And the extra 32meg flash memory cards cost USD100!! Thats way too  much just to hold an extra 30 minutes of music. I recently sold my Rio and  purchased a portable Minidsic playerrecorder for USD275. My advice to people  would be to save an extra USD100 and go for the minidisc. It uses digital  sound. and does not skip. You can use it to record mp3s from your computer  and the blank 74 minute discs cost less than USD5 a piece. as opposed to USD100  for a 30minute flash memory card for the Rio. Minidisc is a much better  overall value than the Rio. I would not recomend any buy a portable mp3  player until the storage can be greatly increased at a much lower cost.,2,0,1056

AE8HKSVNLQRC7,0,Not sure if these tapes are knockoffs. but these tapes jam in our Sony BM575 portable recorders.  They seem to work OK in our Lanier desk recorders.If we hold one of the the Sony cassettes next to a TDK cassette .which work fine in the BM575. the tape in these Sony cassettes looks visibly taller.Unfortunately we are stuck with about 30 3packs now.  I do not recommend this seller or these tapes.,1,0,397
AE8W6OW6A1M5M,1,When I originally signed up for Caller ID it was before Call Waiting ID was available in my area. The original box worked fine. I particularly liked the redialing button that allowed me to call back ALL numbers that come in from the box.However. since I now have Call Waiting ID. I obviously wanted a box that would allow me to take full advantage of that feature. I also wanted one that can store more than 50 numbers. Thats why I purchased this new box by Southwestern Bell.On a positive note. the box does display waiting calls while you are on another call. It also has an easy to read display. The blinking red new call indicator is easy to spot from a distance. But...The redial button only works for LOCAL CALLS. I dont mind the box letting me know that a call is out of my local calling area. but I want the option to dial toll and long distance calls from the box. This box does not. This is particularly annoying to me because sometimes I check my cell phone messages from my land line phone to save airtime charges .but its a toll call. so the redial button doesnt work.. It will however. let me dial certain calls in different area codes .automatically putting the u0026quot1u0026quot in front.. as long as its u0026quotlocalu0026quot .nontoll..My old box was nice in this area. because if the call was out of my area code. all I had to do was press one button before pressing u0026quotdialu0026quot to insert a u0026quot1u0026quot before the area code that was already displayed. It also gave me three dialing options .7digit. area code with 7digit and u0026quot1u0026quot with area code with 7digit.. This is very important because certain area codes are requiring callers to dial even your local area code due to u0026quotoverlappingu0026quot area codes.Another annoying thing about this new box is that there is no audio indication that a call is waiting. The other day I was on the phone. I didnt realize someone was calling me until I looked at the box .and that red new call indicator was shining.. However. by then the person had already hung up.I would only recommend this box for people who rarely make toll calls. Just remember to keep your eye on the box while youre on a call.,3,0,2201

All future systems to come are going to have 128 meg  chips as an industry standard.  Get ahead of the game while you can.  I  have 396 megs of ram..yep three 128 meg chips.  Nothing I like better than  burning a cd. downloading an mp3 and playing counter strike online all at  the same time!  Of course my cable modem helps but that is another story...  Have fun!,5,1,674
AEDA08LVYU8V2,1624,. BEWARE .the Rcr123 batteries from tenergy will over charge to around 4.7 volts making them usless in some equipment like my cree flashlight. not sure if its the charger or the fact that their rcr rather than just cr batteries.,1,0,228

AEE2GJR0VF6R7,0,Dont buy this! First the autowinder dose not work at allI had to leave the wire under the cap Second. the wires do not workI could only hear sound from one ear. sometimes none And third. the earphones are hugethey hurt my ears so much. I could not wear it for more than ten minutes.I give it two star only because when I first bought it. it worked well. and porvided pleasureable sound. But then. everything down hill. Bad quality!I will have to throw it away. buy a real headphone!!,2,0,483
AEE2GJR0VF6R7,1619,It was perfect for my Sony comcorder. plus two or four tapes. extra bateries. and even AC adapter. Only annoying thing was that it makes this weird u0026quotGi. GI. Gi. GI.u0026quot sound .plastics gliding. when carrying it around. The strap is decent. not extremely comfortable. many improvments can be made. It is just the right size. and I think its a good buy.,4,1,364
AEE2GJR0VF6R7,44,This tape is the worst tape in the world!  I bought one pack. but all of them were defects. I used them to tape my trips. but at every end of the tape. it always messes up .the last five minutes.. Low quailty. Dont buy it!,1,0,222
AEE2GJR0VF6R7,23,For its price. this thing is good over all. I have two of them.. but it doesnt have a super good quality. and its not very easy to find the CD you want in it .Its hard to explain why. just trust me.. I suggest you to  buy this thing. I like it a lot. Thank you for your time and you are  Welcome.,4,1,296
AEE2GJR0VF6R7,14,Its a great charger. You can basically bring it to anywhere you go. But one advice. dont buy too many batteries. because most of the time you think  that you really need a lot of batteries. but after you really bought  a lot of batteries. you will realize that you dont need that much! And  regret about wasting money. And if you are out of battery. you can just  charge them again. two hours after. they are full charged.,4,1,422
AEE4K4TKZRD5J,1,I read other reviews and I have used this item app. 25 times now and it works just fine. it workes like my old original one did 15 yrs. ago. The automatic function to load and unloed is good.,4,0,191
AEEX49VWL5MF4,1212,Just a short review of my two weeks with the Nook Simple Touch.  This looked the the reader to get when it came out.  Specifically for me the touch screen was a must.  I enjoyed reading on it everyday until I returned it.  It was light and extremely easy to navigate with its touch screen.  What happened though. was on about the 12th day while using it the touch screen stopped responding.  I couldnt turn a page with the screen or pull up a menu with the screen or do anything else.  And. when I shut it off and turned it back on I couldnt swipe the screen to get into the book  I was completely stuck...locked out.  Finally after fiddling with it after about 15 minutes it started to work again.  I went on the web and found out that others had this same thing happen to them so I decided to return it rather then hope for a fix .I was still within my 14 days return policy..,3,0,878
AEFRJ6ZBKGZV2,2703,Memorex T120 VHS tapes were pretty good quality picture and sound.but they have been discontinued.so youll have to find another brand.,4,1,134
AEFRJ6ZBKGZV2,34,RCA may be one of the easiest videotapes to find.besides Sony brand. In my book RCA videotapes are much better than Sony. I do occassionally find small flaws using the RCA tapes.but these are nowhere near as bad as the flaws I have had with Sony tapes. There is the rare occassion that there might be a tracking line towards the bottom of the screen.but anymore you get that with VCRs being cheaply made not able to record as good.as the old ones. RCA tapes are pretty good tapes to use for recording movies for your videolibrary.not the best but nowhere near the worst.,4,1,570
AEFVFJS30YCHG,0,This remote is a very helpful tool.  Works well with all my components. I put away my other 4 remotes in the junk drawer. I suggest trying it first to see if its right for you. You can always return it if it doesnt work  out.,4,1,225
AEHM0PXWWZQM6,26,We use this label machine and label tape in a law office.  We label all files .open files and closed..  We go through a lot of labeling tape.  This tape works well black lettering on white tape.  Happy with product.,4,1,215
AEJAGHLC675A7,0,If you have looked around for the ideal case for the Palm IIIxe like I did. then you know how frustrating this can be. Most seasoned Palm owners I talked to have gone through two to four cases before finding one that suited their individual needs. Many of these owners had ended up with this case as the best solution when one wanted to carry their Palm III in a u0026quothandsfreeu0026quot fashion.This is a wellmade beltclip case. and you have the choice of using the belt loop or the metal clip to secure it to your person. Ive even used the sturdy metal clip to fasten it conveniently to the strap of my notebook PC when going from car to office.The black leather is soft. and the case is lined so that you can slide the PDA out easily  once youve broken it in. I had heard that it was hard to remove the PDA from this case. so when I got mine. I simply inserted my Palm IIIxe into the case with its flip cover attached. Then I carefully eased two floppy disks into the case as well .do this carefully. and left it for the weekend. Three days later. I could slide my IIIxe in and out the case without any problems. flip cover and all. If you want it to slide even easier. use it without the flip cover. as there is an interior panel designed to protect the screen.The toploading lid to this case is reversed so that it will not inadvertently snag on things. and is Velcro fastened. There is just enough light padding to protect the Palm device from light bumps and accidents. but just remember that this is not an armored case.There are a couple of other leather cases with clips on the market. but if you do the research youll find that some of the owners have complained about the clip breaking off. This doesnt appear to be a problem with this case.If youre looking for extreme portability without a lot of frills. then this may be your best choice. Do yourself a favor though. and read the other reviews here as well!,5,1,1925
AEJT2DC70YC5H,1718,I have to say honestly that within the first week this little device saved me.  My biggest hangup is that it does tend to false quite a bit.It does a superior job with Ka bands compared to some Cobra detectors I have had.  Mostly if it detects a Ka band it is usually a cop.  It falses terribly with X band but the great thing is its signal strength counter goes up to 9 so at say 1 or 2 I dont worry too much.You may be struggling to see the light behind the u0026quotXu0026quot. u0026quotKu0026quot. and u0026quotKau0026quot bands.  I rely on the voice alert to tell me exactly what band it is detecting and in time I have learned the different sounds for the bands.That covers the high points.  If youre not passing. stay out of the left lane.  . .,4,1,751
AEK4YQKKDX33P,33,I had been looking for a decent. affordable everyday radio for use at the beach. etc. and selected this model based on the  customer reviews.  I received the radio in the timeframe promised and as I proceeded to use it for the first time the antenna snapped right off at the base.  I was appalled.  Ive never lost an antenna and couldnt believe how cheaply this radio was made.  GE should be ashamed of themselves. Im returning it for a refund.,1,0,444
AEKA2XSOMNWKK,715,These earbuds are too big to fit ears.  They dont rest comfortably on the outside. either.  The material is hard. and they have fallen out of my ears several times.

I went back and tried at least 15 floppies that the other drive read.  All this drive did was make a loud noise.  Since I got this drive on points I not even returning it.

It isnt perfect. but it is fast and easy to set up and start using.There are many cool features like custom Postcards you can create.  video  conferencing. or games. It comes with several galleries of clip art and  photos to help you get started.  You can also take pictures and make  videos.  The picture quality is decent too.  As I said before. use your  imagination and you can have a ball with this thing!  I photograph my art  work and blast it into cyberspace in the blink of an eye.  Yowza!,4,1,561

AESA65YO51PRN,1923,In spite of my problems with Netgears PA101 Phoneline 10X USB adapter. I gave their Ethernet hub a try.  My faith in the company has been restored!  My two computer home LAN was up and running as fast as I could plug in the  cables.  I have been using it for about a month now with no problems  whatsoever.As for the 10BaseT limitation. I doubt we would see a  performance gain with 100BaseT.  We use the network mainly for print and  Internet sharing through a 56K modem.  10BaseT has more than enough  bandwidth to handle that amount of information.,5,1,551

AETVWR727LRFP,22,We work with legacy data and often find ourselves with data from floppy units. I bought this unit for two reasons. 1. It works great with Windows 7  simple plug and play. 2. its cost.  A good little performer.,4,1,209
AEUJOOTLU51ZC,0,I bought this to work with my new phone. I didnt know that it wouldnt work with it. and that I had to get another program to go with it before it would even recognize my phone. Then it said my phone was not supported. So this was a complete waste of money for me. Im just glad it didnt cost very much.,1,0,301
AEUQI3BM3X9JW,0,With the introduction of newer entry levels speakers .most notably the Logitech Z series.. many people have wondered about the worth of these speakers. Certainly they are not stellar in all categories. nor would I categorize them as being super in any one. Compared to my Z680s. they are certainly not as rich in tonal quality nor in overall dynamic range. but considering that the Z680s cost me four times as much. and the ACS54s should not be considered a disappointment.However its primary competition is most likely the Z640 and Z540 from Logitech. You can find the Z640s for around .money. if you look hard enough. which means paying more than .money. for a ACS54 is of questionable value. The Logitech Z640 and Z540s definitely have a lot more low end and high end. but in my opinion their midrange is not as defined as the ACS54. There are also some other 56 speaker sets in the .money. price range that offer comparable value. though dont for a minute think they are up to Klipsch 5.1Logitech Z680Megaworks 550D quality.For a set of speakers that won the 3D Sound Surge Seal of Approval in May 2000 .... Id say they have been since outdated. though if you can find one for about .money. they do offer a decent audio experience. Wont likely get you in trouble with the neighbors. but still bags some punch.I gave them 4 stars because Ive been a satisfied owner for more than a year now. and only recently replaced them. They certainly offer much better value than the CyberAcoustic CA41004400 speakers and almost certainly better than any entry level 3 piece speaker set.,4,1,1578
AEUV9916W7NQM,0,I have been using it on my PC for 2 years now. This madeinChina product proved to be very reliable.  It sounds great with games and CD audio.  It sounds A LOT better than those mini 2 speakers. For just USD40. I dont see why we should use the cheapy mini speakers.  My only complain is the volume distortion.  If I push the volume higher than 5 using the buildin volume control. the speakers starts to have some background noise.,4,1,429
AEVGI82M8PECC,0,This TV wall mount serves its purpose and thats it. Its not easy to adjust. It is really cheap feeling and seems to make the TV lean one way or another. It was better than paying USD65USD70 at best buy. I like it enough to not return it though and Im super meticulous.,4,1,268

AEY40D96ZZ6YL,0,LIKE THE OTHERS THAT WROTE IN WITH A ONE STAR RATING. I BOUGHT THIS FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER BY MARCH IT STOPPED WORKING THINKING IT WAS THE BATTERIES WE CHANGED THEM. NOTHING!!! I TRIED GOING BACK TO THE STORE BUT BECAUSE IT WAS A SPECIAL PROMOTION WHERE YOU SPEND A HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU GET A FREE BARBIE. THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK OR EVEN A CREDIT BUT THEY WOULD GIVE ME AN EVEN EXCHANGE. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THEY ONLY CARRY THEM AT CHRISTMAS TIME. I HAVE TRIED LOOKING ON THE INTERNET FOR A WEBSITE. DIDNT FIND A THING. THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER TO BE FOUND OR EVEN A COMPLETE ADDRESS.

AEZ3CR6BKIROJ,0,This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7  to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey. but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.,4,1,416

Im throwing this thing on the book shelf. I feel taken advantage  of by Audible. It seems they have established a track record with me of not  returning emails for customer support also. Knowing what I know now. I  would rely on Audible softwares ability to transfer to the RIO 500! With  all the gadgets. upgrades and software Ive dealt with. I have never seen  anything sold that works with less reliability! My problems seems to be  primarily with Audibles software!,1,0,624

AF0YPT0IA6UD8,34,I have had my Panasonic PVDV910 only three weeks when it accidentally fell on a hard floor and the camcorder stoped working. I was very concerned since nothing seemed to work and I promptly sent it to the Panasonic repair  center in Illinois. I thought that it would be quite expensive to have the  camera repaired and that the warranty would not cover it since it was my  fault that the camcorder broke. To my surprise. the camera was returned to  me in less than 3 weeks. repaired. at no charge. I didnt even pay for  Su0026ampH. Panasonic returned the camcorder to me in time for Christmas and  New Year. Panasonic repair center deserves 5 stars for an outstanding  service!  As far as the camera is concerned. I love it. I did a lot of  investigation prior to deciding on this particular model. For the price.  this camera is an outstdanding choice. with great digital resolution and  great features.,5,1,904
AF2E33JSLGV67,7278,This is a great product  it literally runs my life from the time I get up. go to meetings. and go to bed!

I bought a  screen saver film to protect.  Cannot even imagine hauling huge dayrunner  books anymore!,4,1,384
AF2KZPW2E8TFN,57,I looked at both the Kindle and the Nook Simple touch thoroughly before purchasing them. From what I read they are very very similar with some slight variation on details. The inability to download epub files was what drove me to the nook instead of the kindle. Why wouldnt a device primarily built for reading ebooks not support the 1 ebook format ..epub.? It only makes sense from a business and money making perspective. not a customer focused perspective.The only good thing I can say about the Kindle is that it is 100% easier to download library books to it. Using the Adobe Digital software to unlock library books with the nook was a headache at first. and Im a librarian who is somewhat techsavy. .D Once you do it once. its easy to do again. but it is frustrating.The only other criticism I have about the nook is this. Why bother making it wifi? The only way you can add content to your device .other than purchasing content from Bu0026N. is to hook it up to the computer? .S,5,1,986
AF55QHQTEOPF3,44,I now buy nothing but Kensington mice and trackballs. They are built well and have superior drivers. The Orbit is a great entry level trackball I got for my sons Mac Mini.

AF5QW34KDMFCG,2,Although nook is pleasant to look at and the reading feature is excellent. the pros end there. The capacity of the system running nook is slow and has the tendency to freeze or throw you out of a function and or the online system. I dont know if these problems are caused by the capacity of the system itself or the instrument. On July 13 I was thrown off BNs system 23 times and the nook froze a total of 34 times.When using it as exclusively a reading instrument I would grade it as very good. Any other functions would get a grade of poor to fair,2,0,549

AF68EM698UDZ8,0,Bought this to use to connect my HTC Inspire to my PC . using the cable that came with it on the charger .Connected it to my PC and it constantly started going from connected to disconnected in windows.The Car Panel App also would immediately open up.Decided to try and use it as that charging cable instead and it made things worse... caused the car panel app to initiate again and then would open and close on its own.Continued to do so after removing the cable.Researched and found that issue is often caused by cables incorrectly pinned andor getting debris on the phones usb connections.Once I was able to get car panel app to stop...tried the original cable again and had no issues. Problem definitely started with the this cable I purchased.Spend a couple of extra bucks and get a certified HTC cable.They did ship it out quickly...,1,0,839

AF76LEWCTVR14,33,This thing was the first MP3 ever? Wow! Not too shabby. Its durable.it has good sound .satisfactory at 64kbs.. it looks cool. and most importantly. it gets the job done.  Throwing music on the Rio from my CDs and my computer is simple. Who cares if it doesnt support USB? I can go brush my teeth or  clean my room while I wait 5 minutes for all 17 songs to download onto the  Rio. Thats right. 17 songs at 64kbs. which makes me happy since I havent  even upgraded this inexpensive device yet. In fact. i might not even need  to upgrade it Im already content. No moving parts. no skipping. la dee da  da. bla bla.great sound. and it all does the job with one u0026quotAAu0026quot  battery. which lasts for hours upon hours.

AF8EJ3J9QJZF,22,These relatively inexpensive noicecancelling headphones really does its job well. remarkable how it reduces the cabin noice on a Boing 747 by at least 50%. Its actually possible with these to follow a movie being shown and understand all thats being said without too much concentration. As for the sound quality. theyre probable nothing fancy but they produce a good deal more bass than your standard inflight headset. My only problem with these is the comfort issue. After 12 hour of wearing my ears gets redannoyed. This is because they rest on the ear itself where I wouldve preferred an overtheear solution. I am happy I got them however. great value for the money. the Sony solution is way WAY more expensive and I just need them for an occational movie in flight.,4,1,769
AF964GBNQKKHW,1718,Bought this sytem at a great price from a local retail chain in chicago.  Got it home and loved putting it together.  The sound is incredible.  The unit is sleek and very stylish. The remote made my friends jealous.  The only complaint that I have is that the spaker wire is too short and those  freaky clips at the ends make it impossible to fine replacement cable.  I  also wanted to find the speaker stands.  Called JBL and they couldnt give  me any info. I would give this sytem a 5 because it is so great but I have  to give it a 4 because of that really short speaker wire. accesories being  impossible to locate. and lousy JBL customer service.,4,1,651

Sure no 32bit support. but. come on. is there really an  appreciable difference with or without it?  Those who say so. dont own  one!,4,1,286
AFBHZ8QV4S61,1111,Ill make it simple. I loved my NOOK. I bring to school every single day and have sixtyplus books on there. Its great because its light. its portable.it fits in my pocket!.. and most importantly. it has all my books at once. It can most definitely be read in direct sun. and I was pleasantly surprised that Barnes and Noble did not lie in the slightest when they advertised no glare. You can side load any pdf or epub file. as well as downloading books from the store. The book management is simply fantastic. The reading quality is also great because you can change font size as well as the font itself.However. on day I picked it up and I couldnt unlock it. I wasnt very worried. because the NOOK occasionally doesnt respond to touch because the infared sensors are blocked by dust and dirt. But it still wouldnt respond after cleaning it as well as five hard reboots. which were the only thing the BN support line could offer. I feel dissapointed but ordered the new Glowlight and hope that it will last longer. because it was just great while it lasted. I hope you have a better experience with your NOOK if. that is. you decide to buy this older model.,3,0,1156
AFBITC00SM4YN,0,I should have paid more attention when ordering.  This does not work on the iMac. its not USB.  I had to buy another one.  Sigh.,1,0,128
AFCSSS1MPHJPO,3439,This charger does work. but it is not made by Garmin. it is a knock off.  The Garmin Nuvi 1490 Standard Red LED Wall  AC  Home Charger is not UL Listed and you do not need it.  After I received my Garmin I discovered whenever the Garmin is plugged in to the computer via the .included. USB connection. it is also charging the battery of the Garmin.  Also in order for the Garmin to receive traffic reports on the road. the unit uses the cord .also included with the Garmin in the box. plugged into cigarette lighter as an FM antenna.  The battery included with my Garmin is adequate and most of the time when you are using your Garmin it is already charging. So you do not need another power adapter. it comes in the box with two free power adapters already.  There is no need for another potentially unsafe. unneeded. device.  If you did need an AC adaptor be sure it is made by Garmin. otherwise the quality is very questionable. at a minimum it should be tested for safety by UL or UL Canada.,1,0,995
AFD4TR1EAU3PN,34,For the price range. I doubt that you will find a better detector on the market.  I will agree with another reviewer in that I have had my fair share of falses on the ka band. but then again I wonder if I didnt see the  squad going over the overpass etc.  The city mode works well eliminating  annoying alarm system falses.  The u0026quotvoiceu0026quot is clear and  understandable. but the volume control leaves something to be desired.  All  other settings buttons are easy to use. and the memory .of your previous  settings. is a big plus. All in all. one could do much worse for the price.,4,1,593
AFEXXUGQD774B,11,Excellent GPS unit. Rugged. water resistant. heavy durable feel.This is my first GPS unit. Its very acurate. Ive been using it for Geocaching and its helped me locate several caches I would have not seen without such good acuracy. even under heavy tree cover.It also loves to sit on my dash. while its plugged into my laptop. mapping out neighborhoods wifi connections. .Great unit for the price. Would much rather have this unit than the low end .USD100. etrex.,4,1,462
AFG7AX57PBFO7,0,I DID LIKE THE STRAPS BY THEIR QUALITY AND SPECIALLY THE COLORS ARE VERY GOOD TO SEPARATE YOUR STUFF AND ALSO THE PRICE WAS  IT WAS NOT HIGH,4,1,140
AFGCJOFFMMIGF,0,I recently bought a pair of Motorola 6310 radios .not yet received. and am now trying to figure out which of the earbudmic units can be used with them. without much success.There are several model numbers shown on the Amazon .and other. web sites. with the differences apparently being. .1. the radio model numbers with which they can be used .probably related to items 2 u0026amp 3 which follow. .2. the connectors attached. 2 pin or 1 pin and .3.their VOX capability.  Reference to the Motorola web site for 2 way radios does not clear it up.The Model numbers Ive found for the earbudmic units are.53727 single pin connector and apparently no VOX capability.50229 double pin connector and apparently no VOX capability.50256 double pin connector with VOX capability.Anyone who has definitive applicabilityuse information could be a hero.By the way. the same confusion would appear to apply to the headsetboom mic units .model numbers 50226 with 2 pin connector and VOX and model 53725 single pin connector and VOX.. Same for the speakermic units. model 50225 .shown on Amazon site as only for 250 Series radio.. and model 53724 apparently for all other radios.  Its not clear to me if either of these has VOX capability.If you understand these mysteries please post a review with the answers.  Failing that I suspose I need to use the phone to call Motorola and enter the labyrinth of their automated phone system.,3,0,1415
AFH9OFJ3AVZA1,715,I mostly wanted to comment on the review below.  These CDRs will NOT WORK with Philips or other stereocomponentstyle CDR burners.  Those manufacturers have chosen to follow a standard that only allows you to use  a u0026quotMusicu0026quot CDR. which costs more because they pay some standard  royalties to popular artists.  That sucks!  Anyway. only buy these CDRs if  you are using a computercomponent type of CD burner.  And. if you have a  computer. never buy a stereo component of this type. just do it on your  computer instead ..,5,1,535
AFHLJPG5ZIMNO,2425,My wife and I began using the stylus series years ago  starting with the single focus.  Since then. we have collected several. including two zooms.  They are so good. we find ourselves leaving our fullsize 35mm cameras at  home.  My hobby is birddog training. and you cannot beat them for ease of  operation. picture quality. and dependability in the field.  I have had the  clamshell frozen shut from freeding rain. warmed it in my hand. and then  snapped pictures that turned out exceptional.  As the editor of u0026quotThe  Flushing Whip.u0026quot the official publication of the National Red Setter  Field Trial Association .NRSFTA.. the majority of the pictures published  are taken by our Olympus Stylus cameras.  Get your hands on one and you  will not be disappointed.  Happy Hunting!,5,1,792
AFI68J3L0FXPX,4346,I used this adapter in Sweden. Dec. 2011. Everything worked great. No problems. Only had to use it for three weeks but it always worked when I needed it to.,4,1,156

AFIOUVKPBA7IV,13,I ordered this mount for our 27 inch LCD TV.  It arrived quickly and seems extremely sturdy.  It rotates at multiple angles and seems to fit practically any television mounting layout.  I have 2 major problems with it.  The first is that the mounting diagram that came with my mount. the one that you hang on the wall to drill holes. did not match up with the actual holes on the mount.  I drilled the holes in my wall before I realized this.  The second issue I have is that when the mount is pushed all the way back. the television is not centered on the mount.  The piece that the television actually attaches to is off center several inches to the left.  I thought. prior to purchasing. that the television would lay centered on the wall against the wall mount bracket while pushed all the way back.The mount does seem very well made so I gave it 3 stars. but it definitely didnt look like I imagined on the wall.  Due to my offcenter issue. I am considering a return.,3,0,972
AFIZYAQKT00QO,0,It reached on time but this product is absolutely terrible because I used it for my phone and it didnt in any way. Im simply asking for my money back. No Im sorry but I cant deal.,1,0,179
AFJ6LHAGTA6LS,13,This is exactly as I expected and as described. Simple to install. Sturdy  module  attachment via included Super Glue.  Cable is long enough for three items.  I ran mine through a large eyescrew in the wall to keep the systems from going anyplace.I suppose this item might deserve 5stars  but. by necessity and function. its not every attractive. Not really Kensingtons fault on that.  But something ingenious would earn a 5th star ..,4,1,434
AFJ998SFMQTSD,0,Netgear packaged the wrong software driver disk with my 310 .they send me the 311 driver disk..  I figured if they included the 311 driver there must be a good reason but that turned out to be a poor assumption.  After wasting sometime with the wrong driver I got the 310 driver from their site and install was pretty easy from there.It works very well.. I just wish Netgear was a little more careful.,3,0,401
AFKB3A58T8NEY,0,another hard item to find.these were perfect fit for my camcorder.being an old recorder it is easy finding the things you need.they worked great.wanda,5,0,150
AFKV4ORX8GAL,0,While 100 MB of storage space isnt what it used to be. this is a handy gaget to have particularly if you have data on zip discs from years ago. Best of all. this unit works with Windows 7. you dont even need the included CD. Just plug USB cable into computer with device powered up. computer recognizes the device and assigns it a drive letter ...its that easy !! After that. the unit reads and writes flawlessly ... even tho this is old technology it still serves a usefull purpose. Glad Ipurchased it. no complaints what so ever.,5,1,531
AFLUB7EK21DAH,22,When it comes to computer peripherals at this price. its tempting to ask not how well it works. but does it work at all. Well. it wont intercept your emails while the PCs off. or grab faxes for you. or page you when an  email arrives. but if you want those things youre in completely the wrong  pricerange.  In reallity. I found setting this modem up to be very simple  and straight forward. though I can see how the complete novice may get a  little confused. and it has so far been a solid performer giving good  connection speeds without sacrificing accuracy. My neighbour uses a USD200  modem. and gets precisely the average 48 KBPS connection speeds that I get  on this little budget gem. Im not going into design features and build  quality and all the other things you may be interested in if you were  spending silly money. and as for reliability. well mine hasnt flinched in  2 years. so if it blows tomorrow Ill consider I had my moneys worth.  Capable and reliable this is a great choice for the budget conscious.,4,1,1024
AFLUB7EK21DAH,3132,3dfx have come in for some heavy criticism lately for falling off the cutting edge. failing to support 32bit colour and so on. but the fact remains that the original leaders of the PC 3D revolution are still  producing fine cards. The 2000 is certainly able to cope with anything Ive  given it. whether in native Glide or Directx. Open GL support isnt great.  but for the money and for all bar the most avid gamer. I see no reason to  avoid buying this card. Frame rates are certainly high enough. and the fuss  over 32 bit colour is a bit of a nonstarter as in most games youll not  even notice. this may not be as futureproof as a Geforce for example. but  at the price this is a fine upgrade for users of older accelerator users  wanting to import some gorgeous graphics onto their system.,5,1,792
AFLUB7EK21DAH,77,I cant deny that the look and feel of these speakers oozes quality build. but having connected them I found the sound to be a little lacklustre. The bass was tight and boomfree. but I felt it was a little too timid. and the  midrange was lacking completely with a rather too lively sound. Its a  shame as it looked so good on my desk. and while the faults all but  disappeared during game play. the music reproduction through my  soundblaster live was just missing the richness I was hoping for. A lot of  care has gone into the design .except for the volume placement. and if your  soundcard supports 4 speakers out. the connection of another two quality  units certainly lifts the overall quality. I still think these are great  speakers for the price. but there are more rounded options for not a lot  more money.,3,0,816
AFM2G22AW3XWH,55,I have basically the same model as described except for mine only has 10 seconds of antiskip I think it is great it works well has good sound quality for the price.  I do have to agree that there needs to be some  small improvements on the design like a hold button to prevent unwanted  battery drain maybe a power saver feature that gives you more battery life  and maybe a window to view the cd as it is playing.  All in all though I  think koss has built a great product even though there are some minor flaws  with the design.  I was wondering does anybody know if the antiskip  feature is supposed come on when the player is turned on I ask because it  does on mine and I just wanted to know if this is normal or not.,4,1,722
AFNBEXFF6GY1M,67,its a cute design. but when i got it in the mail it looked like it had been used. the case was chipped and scratched. Not to the point of where i just through it away but its by no means a new case. It fits on nicely and stays on but it will not come off. if i take it off i know it will break. no doubt about that. so as long as my phone doesnt need to be cleaned it will work fine. still a cute case. dont know if id recommend it to a friend... but still if your not picky and just want a cheap case that looks ok. its for you! ive had it about 4 weeks now and will keep it til it breaks down.,3,0,595

AFQF64QVQXSKV,16,On the plus side. this camera was really easy to install.  Andthe software looked very easy to use.  And it is one of the cheapestpc cameras on the market.  But why bother to buy it if all you can seeis a big blur even in decent lighting?  And why has IBM even putsomething so useless out on the market?If you look on the back ofthe box. youll see a sample of the software with really sharppictures.  Dont be fooled. those sharp bright pictures were not evercreated with this camera!  If they showed a truely realisticdemonstration of this camera on the back of the package. you would seedark. grey. blurry images.If you want a pc camera spend a littlemore if you have to. but get something that actually works.  Dont buythis.,1,0,726
AFQHIL1EROP1F,33,This packs a lot of features for a decent price. The different power options are great. If you are going to use it for distances farther than car to car. you NEED a bigger antennae or a roof top one,4,0,198
AFRUIFSXMGGKK,11,I just returned this item. I began to notice it skipping.  It seems to skip after the first couple of tracks.  At first I thought it was one particular CD but it happens on all sorts of discs.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.Im getting the Yamaha 5disc unit instead. I had a Yamaha and was always impressed with the sound.  You get CDs because of the nice sound so why settle for less.  The sound quality of the JVC wasnt up to the Yamahas .it sounded a bit muddy. but for USD100 less I was willing to live with it.  Now Im going back for both quality and sound.,1,0,574
AFS0M7QYNFBJ8,0,This tablet must be one of the starter versions as it was not like the Nook tablet that I already own.  It would not down load anything . kept  saying library was full.,1,0,168
AFT9WAT8DCWKR,66,Now Im noticing in the day u0026 age of cd formats u0026 mp3 downloading that finding good cassettes in just your average store here in michigan is hard to find now. so i was glad to be able to go through amazon to get what i needed.u0026 me being into the quality of the maxell cassettes since the mid 80s i just cant use any other tape. mainly due to me still working pretty regular with a four track recorder which requries a high bias tape for the best sound. so even though some may feel like im in the stone age for still using cassettes but what im able achieve sound wise through equalizers u0026 the four track is still cutting edge thanks to good tapes that can handle the pressure.,5,1,692
AFTOBK4M64RVV,22,I use these all the time to organize my cables and power cords. They are long enough to do a great job .nlike some that are too short to wrap the entire cable..I recommend them.,4,1,177

AFUQINHJN3OCJ,0,I bought this yesterday in order to place a fax machine where there is no telephone outlet. I followed all instructions closely and it worked fine for about an hour. Couldnt get it to work again after that. Today called customer support for Audiovox which apparently makes this device. Nice lady on the phone but offered basically sympathy  absolutely no help at all. She started me on a wild goose chase through RCA customer support. I think I called at least seven 800 numbers. transferred multiple times. on hold forever. finally got someone who knew something about the product. Went throught various reset procedures and got it to work  oh. and by the way she said. all kinds or other wireless devices interfere with it such as WiFi. wireless computer networks. portable phones! This time it worked for about an hour again and quit.I was also told that the product has been discontinued! Why anyone conti nues to sell this piece of junk I do not know. Just let me warn you  do not be a sucker and buy one. It was obviously discontinued for a reason.,1,0,1054
AFUYYYRKWBAT4,11,Its hard to find vcr tapes now. but we need them for an old imaging device and this is a great source.,4,1,102
AFUZWXRDOSHTC,0,Used it to clean out my old Xbox when my games were skipping. It worked well for that purpose although I fear that products like these are quickly losing their niche as more and more games are downloaded and more and more movies are streamed. I used it once but I will probably only use it 4 times in the next 10 years or so.,4,1,325
AFW0DOKAFVQYF,0,I too had all the problems mentioned with the Amp.  Mine failed within the first year.  I sent it back for service.  It worked for a while and then failed again ... this time outside of warranty.  It sounded good when it was working.  Im considering purchasing an aftermarket amp from a 3rd party to get it running again.  I wouldnt pay too much for one of these due to the frequent failure rate.,1,0,396
AFWMVMPB2WVP9,11,The Rio 500 holds a decent amount of music. and the battery lasts longer than I expected. But best of all. it is Mac compatible and the tranfer speed via USB is FAST! If you use SoundJam on your Mac. the interface is right through that application.,5,1,248
AFWPH07F1FTXE,44,I received the basic Nook as a Christmas gift. Never really wanted a reader or tablet. Im an oldfashioned book kinda gal. But. when my daughter and I decided to make a trip to Spain. I returned the Nook reader and decided to upgrade to the HD so that I could travel with a tablet that would enable me to check email. surf the web. and read books and magazines. Im just learning to use it but so far I think Im really going to enjoy having this tablet. The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star rating is because it didnt come with a manual .I did say I was an oldfashioned book kinda gal.. Would highly recommend the Nook HD for your entry into the world of tablets and readers!,4,1,677
AFXTKAO0CB354,33,Perfect if you have an older type keyboard plug and need to use a PS2 type keyboard with it.,5,0,92
AFXTKAO0CB354,1313,If you still use blank VHS VCs like I do. this three pack is really handy. I know that most of us are using DVDs now. but I still find a use at times for an eight or nine hour VC and this fills the bill. This tape stands up pretty well to being used over and over and I would surely suggested it if tape is what you need.,5,1,321
AFXVN6Y3KTNIK,33,This is a sturdy and attractive surge protector. Its obviously well made. the colors look nice .Ive gotten quite a few complements. which is funny. for a surge protector.. Its kind of overpriced to be honest. but I liked my first one so much I bought a second one for the office a couple years later.Unlike some surge protectors Ive had in the past. the sockets dont melt .scary. huh?. and plugs slide firmly in or out but are held with a firm grip.,4,1,449
AFZ9P5UB6FHQ,1414,The manual is confusing and GARBAGE!  .1. Cant match the manual description and Sync software and what you see on PV200 and Serial cable adaptor. For example. the manual does not describe sync procedure clearly.  On the PV200 no option for Sync. On software there is option for Sync  between casio and pc. .2. No clear .matching. procedure described to send.  receive. sync data between PV200 and PC. The procedure does not clearly  tell which button to press from where PV200 screen or serial port or pc?  .3. The adrress book is not compatible to excel or oher standard software  for address. Or the procedure is not described. .4. Sometimes the DataSync  works and sometimes does not. .5. Illuminator auto shutoff time cant be  selected. it is fixed. .6. No direct icon for calculator. To use calculator  three steps of key operations are required ! .7. Manual does not reflect  what is seen on PV200 screen .8. Search operation is case sensitive.

AG2UZLYSVTIZO,11,Its unfortunate the review from the gentleman from Mill Valley. CA is listed first .I write this August 12. 2001..

AG425VCFQXH4Z,12,I find that the adjustments on the Quick Cam Pro are very precise and if I use the manual mode and reset all the settings in each situation  condition such as lighting. color etc.. I can take a pretty good still  picture.  The video motion however is another story.  The speed is such  that all movements are jerky and far from real life.  This is especially a  major irritant when conferencing between our office locations.  I thought I  could put in an accelerator card to solve the problem but was told that the  camera just isnt good enough.  I have 11mb or Ram for video at present.  I  guess Ill be buying another product.  NOT a good thing.  Another problem  is that I have to diconnect the printer from its port in order to use the  camera.,2,0,748

AG7OGH739NMSD,11,Was highly recommended by a friend. I like most of the features of this item. The readers do a great job. Bookmark feature is handy when I use it right. Easy to carry. although I wish I could copy and download parts to my MP3 player. Some times the onoff button takes a while to kick in and sticks. .Dont know if this is a manufacturing problem or related to the reason it was refurbished. Should have come with rechargable batteries. because of the onoff problem. it tends to drain batteries. Still enjoy taking it with me on walks.,4,1,533
AG94WPFCT30TR,0,I am rather happy with this purchase which I bought a few months ago.  I had the palm 111. and although the size was smaller. the functionality of Win Ce was excellent and much better.  I had no problems whatsoever with  setting it up with my computer and file transfer between outlook was  excellent. and reasonably fast!  When looking at all the pros and cons I  am very happy with this machine and I recommend it to anybody who lives a  busy lifestyle and requires a PDA to make your life easier.,4,1,499

AGBQUYXWK11MU,11,Ive had this DVD player for 2 years and have watched hundreds of movies so far.  Its behind in the technology curve now. but its reliability and quality are good indicators of the whole Toshiba line.  Im particularly impressed with the picture quality when matched to my Toshiba television set using the compositve video outputs  significantly better than the standard coax output and Svideo output.  The one down side is that it doesnt play any VCD format disks.  My goal was to convert all my 8mm video to VCD format so that I could play them in my DVD. but I was unsuccessful.  After scouring web sites I found that the Pioneer DVD players seem to provide the best support for playing all the diffent DVD formats. so thats what Ill probably buy in the future.  However. if youre looking for a solid entrylevel player  this one is it.,4,1,836
AGCH14JUICTCM,11,Ereader works well. although Ive flashed it with a custom rom.Kindle app works well with custom android. but because I live in europe I havent been able to install the nook application.The tablet is a bit on the slow side. but workable. the cpu inside isnt as quick as one of the more recent tablets.But I enjoy using it as an ereader. which is why I bought it in the first place.,4,1,380
AGCJVUG8IT125,11,i love it. but when i ripped my cds into the computer .from musicmatch.. and into the mp3 player. it has some problem playing the songs. and i have to do some turning on and off techniques for it to play the song... besides  that. very good battery thing. very good sound. and basically very good  advice.

AGD7V915Z99CU,1113,I bought this camcorder for its features and size. On the shell it seems like a killer product. However. after I bought it. Ive noticed annoying.  loud drum and zoom motor noises that become recorded on tape. Ive sent it  for service. They replaced a video drum and shipped it back. The noises  didnt disappear. I sent it for service again. They did nothing and shipped  it back .without an explanation.. Again I sent it for service and followed  up with phone calls. They claim there is no problem with the unit it is  supposed to work like this! Ive never seen a camcorder .even a thrid of  its price. that was so noisy. The product is simply FLAWED. The service  was also an unpleasant experience. The product has to be shipped to a  scarsely located service center .Ive spent almost USD50 on shipping.. The  personnel was unresponsive and played a game of u0026quotdo nothing and a  customer will go awayu0026quot. After a verbal bout with the service manager.  he agreed to refund the money for the camcorder. However I got stuck with  extra accessories worth over USD100 I bought for this unit. When I called the  JVC customer relations. they suggested it was only MY problem with not  being satisfied with THEIR product and I should be glad they refunded the  unit price. This whole experience of owning this JVC product was very  unpleasant from both emotional and economical point of view. Ive decided  to buy Sony TRV11 camcorder which I very happy with.,1,0,1464
AGEG9ZRFALWM8,1418,Based on the excellent and revealing reviews here. I bought one of these three weeks ago from Amazon for USD434. with free shipping.As others have expressed. the display is gorgeous. theres no OSD for color adjustments. the paper manual is in Korean. the input is DVID only. and there are no drivers supplied.  As long as your expectations are adjusted to these. you will not be disappointed.We received the monitor three days after I placed the order.  Shipping beat up the box quite a bit. but it was very well taped .it took quite a bit of work with a box cutter to reveal the seams. and the contents were undamaged.Were running it in a homeoffice environment. so it gets better than eight hours per day use. as well as more limited use on the weekends.Others have mentioned that the monitor and external power supply run hot  this is not our experience.  The PS brick is sitting at the rear of my desk and is at 121F .measured via an IR gun.. which is pretty warm but not hot.  The monitor itself is no hotter than youd expect considering the large backlight area involved.  Certainly a lot cooler than our 60  Samsung TV!Were using it with a 2007vintage MacBook Pro. via a newlypurchased Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual Link DVI Adapter. which retails for USD100  I purchased a new one on eBay for USD58 shipped and its been working flawlessly for the past three weeks.  The MacBook is pushing 2560 x 1600 resolution to the monitor just fine.When I attempted to use this monitor on another computer .WinXP. with my aged NVidia GTX260. I do not see a boot display.  I have not pursued this issue. but if I can get that combo working. Ill be purchasing a second YAMAKASI 301 Sparta for use on that computer as well.At the vantage point of three weeks. my only concern is longevity I see a reviewer had his similar model die at 14 months.,5,1,1839
AGG6OMGC18HF1,0,This handy product is really nice. but its just to big and bulky to carry it on your waist like its designed to do. but its great to use it as a hand carrying case especially if you have a lot of CDs to carry.as well as the CD player.,4,1,234
AGI12BR1TOUHR,33,Great little handheld for the price! easy on batteries and has great reception perfect pour use in a automobile on a ATV or just in your hand,4,1,141
AGI2X2N9PBBR4,0,This is a great cd lens cleaner my new cd player would not play straight out of the box. I orderd this cleaner it started working first time i used it.lens must have been dirty shipping was fast thanks,5,1,201
AGJ0DW8O7D9FL,22,This product LOOKs just like the SPECK cases. but they a flimsy. and do not have single holes on the side for all of your plugs. There is a large cut our area. the your plugs fall our of. I purchased this product then went to the Speck about three months later.,1,0,261
AGJEFBYEYM9LA,24,works as designed the price is just right . I will  recommend this item to my friend .it works with the proper length.,4,1,118
AGJL1CWEV1U3K,0,Got this for my niece for Christmas and she said its works great downloaded alot of books already  she uses it all the time.,4,1,124
AGJN1KQAZPNTG,0,decent product and very useful for storage in my car a bit on the pricey side however.,3,0,86
AGK1RLI9Z1MRE,1,after I received this cb I took it along with me on a motorcycle trip with other motorcycle people which had cb on there motorcycles. It worked but not like the installed ones but I didnt pay USD750.00 for it like they  did.,4,1,224
AGL4FKIL9IYXA,0,The pink cable was like USD1 when I bought it. so you really cant beat the price. Its a pretty standard cable and it works just fine. The connectors are pretty good. the only negative I have is the little plastic guards that protect the tab on the connector are fragile if you push them sideways very much they come right off. But honestly you dont need those . they can even be annoying in tight spaces.. and for USD1 the quality cant be beat!,4,1,444
AGLPILT74MF8L,0,Ive had mine for about two years. and Ive seen my fair share of problems with it.  First of all. the hold switch never worked.  I would put it on and the cd player would start playing in my bag.  Sometimes when you press the foward button to go to the next track. the esp goes off.  And sometimes I press the buttons. and nothing happens.  It eats up batteries like crazy.  Ill be going on a four hour car trip. and before the ride is done. I need to switch batteries.  Also the headphones are made very poorly. and the spring holding the top on fell out recently. so I have to hold the top on with a rubberband.  The good things about this player are the sound and esp.  The bass boost sounds really good and when the esp has been on. I havent had a skip.  Overall Id say that you should probably buy a different player. because this is an okay one but it is not worth the price.,3,0,880
AGLYDOVBI0S49,1,The Zip drive worked fine on my Mac PowerBook G4 running OS 10.4. I didnt want to try it on my iMac until I had transferred all the old files from the Zip disks and burned them to CDs. And though Im trying to get rid of all the old Zip disks. this will come in handy for a few years yet.,5,1,287

AGNSNX5JC67MH,0,I like this stylus.  They are slimmer circumference than others I have ordered from China.  They are nonmarring.no streaks on glass.. About 4 u0026 14 inches long.  Price is unbeatable.  Glad I ordered a handful.,4,1,212

AGOL1UIZVLC75,0,...not very loud. and the sub tends to get boomy. other than that. best sound for the money.still is.. perfect u0026quothifiu0026quot for a student living in a dorm...took it to a friends home with a portable cd player. my friend laughed at my portable gimmicky stereo at first. they werent laughing anymore when they heard it playing.,4,1,335
AGOQ4B0YRLMOP,11,Do not buy one of these....Im on my third one and it just quite tonight. JBL could not build a class D powered subwoofer that works to save their soul.If I were a manufacturer of garbage such as this I would recall all of them and pile them up and light a fire and pink slip every monkey engineer that had anything to do with the amplifier section!!this is the new milenium where china is building everything and we have to expect some failure rate but even their typical electonics MTBF percentage is less than 5% in the first year. these digital amplifiers are 100% failure rate guaranteed to fail in the most critical time frame middle of the movie with your Boss just getting commenting on your rig and kapoof the smake roles out of your sub and the smoke detector starts to wail!If you want to contact me Mr. JBL white collar guy send me an email or a new sub that wont break!,1,0,881
AGPDGIS75UX18,23,I bought this unit a couple of months ago. It works fine. sound is ok but not as good as I expected. Now the battery doesnt last as long when I charge it so I tried to find replacement part. Well the JVC PN is J46691001. and it is USD19.95 + shipping + tax. That makes it at about USD28. almost half the price the whole unit!!!! forget it.,2,0,339
AGQRAZ1L55CY6,11,Like everyone else .I guess. I was seduced by that small bullet colored case that could fit in my shirt pocket.  The conventional wisdom said that if you want a PDA. get a Palm V.  At first I was excited but then saw that  you could only do a few essential items and the screen was impossible to  see.  Also. the buttons always get mashed when it sits in your suit jacket  so that the battery gets wasted.  When I saw a friends CE based PDA with  full color and multimedia. I started surfing for one of those.  I hope Palm  beefs up the processor and the screen to come up with some less drowsy  applicationsthen theyll really have something. Until then. I think  theyre doing Bill Gates a favor.,2,0,696
AGQZW9MI41AFR,5163,Belkin isnt high in terms of consumer name recognition  but they produce a pretty wide range of products.  Cables to Routers.  Ive never been disappointed in any of their products which deliver to value pretty dependably.  This cable is another one of those products.  A simple product .VGA Extension Cord.  but it needs to work reliably.  This cable was nearly the least expensive one available  and it works well  as expected with higher resolution.  Id buy as many more as needed without any regret or remorse.,5,1,513
AGSYRH74471ZF,0,Although the product worked fine. it did so for about 45 minutes. The product has to make an exact connection or it wont work.,3,0,126

AGTV2RUJYFUL0,1,This camera is a dud. I bought one to take on vacation. The photos look okay on the camera. but when you get home and look at them on your PC they are almost all out of focus. The auto fucus worked properly less than 10% of the time. There is NO manual focus on this camera. My vacation shots are  ruined.,1,0,305

AGV4EUW7USPKR,12,Its hard to find decent VHS tapes for recording anymore but this were reasonably priced and worked well. I am quite pleased with them.,4,1,134
AGVB3UZIPFHEF,0,Your Palm V probably came with two  one metal with plastic ends and a hidden pin to reset your palm. and one all plastic.  These are exact replacements for the metal stylus that came with your Palm.  Thats about  it!For the price it seemed like a good idea to have them around just in  case.  You can also keep a spare in each car. or whatever.,5,1,344
AGVB3UZIPFHEF,2326,The Palm Hard Case will keep your Palm V protected. without adding much to its size or weight.  Since I have the Slim Leather Case. and tried the RhinoSkin case. Ill try to address some of the complaints others have  posted.Its only plastic  True. but the outer metal shield adds quite  a bit of protection.The spring is weak  Part of the problem with using  the Palm V hard case is installing your Palm.  If the rail is not centered  in the stylus holder. either the front or the back of the case will not  close properly. giving the impression that the springs are weak.  True.  they could be stronger. but if you use your Palm a lot you want it to open  easily.  There is a line and a flat side on the rail to help you center it.  It may take a few tries. but keep at it.You have to remove your Palm to  use the HotSync cradle  Not true.  Just move the cradle to the edge of  the table or desk and let the case hang over the edge.  Just be careful you  dont knock it off the desk accidently.  Others have suggested placing a  book under the cradle.  Either works fine.Lets face it.  You bought  your Palm V because of its size. and you probably use it a lot.  If so.  this is your best option when it comes to cases.  Pretty good protection.  easy to carry .very slim and trim.. and easy to open and close.  This case  also solves the problem of your Palm turning itself on accidently. a  problem with the leather cases and covers. although the leather cases are  far more elegant and sumptuous.  Also. because this case does not press on  the scroll button. if you forget to turn off your Palm. and close the case.  your Palm will will turn itself off and not run down the battery.The  RhinoSkin case does offer better protection. however I did not feel it was  worth the money .See my review..,4,1,1798
AGVB3UZIPFHEF,1351,The Palm V is one of those electronic gizmos you dont think youll ever need. and then when you get one you cant live without it. Ive been carrying mine around like a pacifier.  When someone stops me on the street  and wants to set up and appointment I used to take their number and check  my calendar back at the office.  Now I can take their number AND make the  appointment.3Com has packaged a proven product in a sexy case and come  up with a real winner.,5,1,458
AGVB3UZIPFHEF,1318,One of the nice features of the Palm V is its slim size.  If the manufacturer of this case would leave out the credit cardcash pockets. it would definitely be a plus.I have not had the accidental turn on  problems others have had. but I think when the case softens up a bit after  use this could be a serious issue.  Ive got friends who switched over to  the hard case. which isnt as u0026quotsumptuous.u0026quot but fits well. will  not accidently push any of the buttons. and is a bit thinner.,4,1,495
AGVK3JTGVTW0,1314,I bought these radios a little while ago. and Ill tell you THEY ARE GREAT! and there not as pricy as other nice ones. I would say that the best thing is the scan feature. I can always pick up my friends transmissions  and find other people who are on. If youre going on a trip or car ride get  these.,5,1,300
AGWLTOOSE255S,1719,the tapes were ok. I though they would sound better since they are tdk tapes. I will stick to sony products as cassette tape go.,3,0,128

AGX4R68F1QS36,0,My neighbor and I bought this charger but I returned mine and I think she is going to return hers also.  It seems a little dated because it charges the batteries for a fixed amount of time .both NiMH and NiCad..  So if your battery is only slightly discharged itll still charge it for the same time as if it were totally dead.  It also cant charge batteries individually which my Rayovac charger can.  The only downfall of my Rayovac is that it can only charge AA and AAA which is all I need.  I paid 25 dollars for the Energizer and the Rayovac was only 10 dollars...  BIG difference.  If you can find a Rayovac recharger at your local store get it!  I even got 16 NiMH batteries for 25 dollars  PLUS theyre ALL 1600mah .higher the rating the more power..  Just thought Id let everyone know.  Alohaz,2,0,800
AGXMTUXS8UD45,7086,I bought this camera after reading lot of reviews. This is the first video camera that I have bought. Few things which PVDV910 lacks is that it does not come with any software so as to edit the Digital Video in the PC. no  firewire cables  even though it has IEEE1394 port for transfer. Eventhough  it says 300x digital zoom. the system does not go beyond 36x. The  performance is very poor in low lighting. Out door in normal sunlight. it  is great. Overall not too happy for the money that I paid for it.,3,0,506
AGXS0D0TW8RUQ,4446,Another DOA. Bought this for a last minute trail ride. Came in dead. I think the speaker in the handset was busted. because it would work when I had a headset plugged in. Returned.,2,0,180
AGYMX1D3QFLH,12,Ive had this camera for 4 months. so I think I know it. PROS. GREAT picture quality for 5x7 or 8x10 prints .rivals my 35mm Canon EOS. which I have sold on ebay.. Small but solid feel to it. Now comes with NiMH  batteries which last a long time. and comes with a plugin charger.  Actually is a great looking camerawill impress your friends. Has its own  internetupgradeable OS. easy to use. but gives you many options for  shooting. much like a full featured 35mm SLR. CONS. Tiny optical  viewfinder. takes some getting use to. LCD screen fine for reviewing. but  unlike Sony is just about unuseable for taking shots. Must get use to 2 sec  delay from pushing shutter button till picture is actually taken.,5,1,705
AGYPJSTFWTA5Y,1516,Bought this as a 2nd set. because I love it so much!  I spend ~6 hours a week on the phone. and MUST HAVE freed up hands.  I also MUST HAVE a quality headset  and this Uniden is perfect. highquality. and highly recommended!Many headsets are bulky. andor have poor sound or voice quality. but not so with this Uniden set.  It fits comfortably u0026 securely on the head. and the movable microphone is such a convenience.  Being able to move it out of the way to grap a sip of coffee. or to sneeze. all without being an audible distraction to the person on the other end. is wonderful!The ear piece delivers terrifically clear sound quality.  No tinsound. no reverb. no crackle...just pure. clean words!  I bought a set for my dad. as he frustratingly went through 3 different .some rather expensive. headsets. each of which failed in some important aspect or another .clumsy wearability. poor audio.  far away  sounding. poor quality microphone. painful to wear. etc...  I heard yesterday that these are my dads favorite! Yay!  Hes used his Uniden HS910 set for several months .the others never met his standards for that long.. and he still loves them.  .Its not that hes fussy. its just that hes on the phone often. needs freed up hands. and needs a goodquality headset.  Like we all do!.This one is IT for him. and for me.  Best headset. and I hope it keeps getting made u0026 sold!!,5,1,1385

AGZCNP1FJ57W5,0,I purchased a secondhand Pioneer DVL919 recently. Mine is the champagne coloured one that is made in Japan.When I accidentally damaged my Panasonic LX K700 LD player. I needed a replacement. Although I also have a BluRay and DVD player. I still have a fairly large collection of laser discs which would cost a bomb replace with Blurays and DVDs. My first purchase was a Pioneer Laserdisc CD Karaoke CLD3760KV. The sound was good but the picture quality was not up to my standards so I bought the DVL919. I am truly happy with it!On the LD side. the picture quality is good. I have never seen the picture quality from a Pioneer Elite model which many have raved about. so I am able to compare the two. Of course. you cannot compare LD image quality to a DVD or Bluray image as there is a 30year difference in technology. Thats like comparing apples and oranges! Side change is very quick. You can pause to a scene and see the picture rather than get a blue screen like other models.DVD picture quality is also good. Despite what you may read on the online reviews that combination players are not that good. this is not the case here. The DVD image is good.In my opinion. sound quality is where the LD is till better than a DVD or Bluray due to the compression and size difference between them. The player has the following features which ensures that the sound is great when playing LD or CD.1. Video Noise Reduction2. Virtual Dolby Surround .certified by Dolby Laboratories Inc..3. DTS .Digital Theater System. Digital Audio Output TerminalI have no problems with the remote. Its big and fits into my large hands. Has a display dimmer if you want to dim or not see the LED display. Has a light switch you can activate if you are watching a movie in the dark. Maybe the arrangement of the buttons could be more user friendly but this is just a minor issue with me.Only other issue is that this model is bigger than most LDs and I have to place it over my amplifier in such a way that the front sticks out a little. Again. just a small issue with me and not a big deal.Also. do not believe the rumours that it can play both NTSC and PAL LDs. I found that out the hard way and now have 3 PAL LDs I cannot play! The DVL919 can only play the NTSC LDs. The European version. the DVL919E is the one that can play PAL Laser discs. However. this was my mistake for not doing a bit of research earlier.Overall. A good player and I would recommend it. It can play LD. DVD and CD with a great sound quality. So. what more can you ask for?,5,1,2527
AGZI85WF7M7KV,22,Ive had a nook for almost a year now and I spend all my time trying to download files. renew books from the library .the only lend for two weeks.. and mess with files that wont open for whatever reason.  Then I have no time left to actually read anything and Im left frustrated and annoyed.  Ereaders seem great in theory. but are a nightmare in practice.  I guess I cant speak for the kindle. but using our Nook to borrow from libraries has been a total waste of time.  Do yourself a favor and stick to the printed books.  No hassle. you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries. and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends. pass it on to your kids. sell it at a garage sale. etc.  All the copyright protection surrounding ebooks makes them absolutely a horrible value for the money you spend and a waste of time on top of it all.  And when you leave your ereader in the taxi. at the restaurant. or some opportunistic thief snatches it when your not looking. you are out USD100.  What thief would target your USD6 paperback?  Yeah. thats what Im talking about.,2,0,1090

AH5KZ1OBXHFLK,0,I am a student living in a dorm situation and so wanted some basic protection for my lap top computer.  I purchased the defcon cl because it was inexpensive. widely availible. and easy to use.  Unfortunately. it has one major drawback. occasionally it decides to change the number combinationss which unlock it.  I went to the company website and they suggested trying the numbers immediately around the combination and if that failed trying all the number combinations possible .there are 10.000..  Several hours. one blister. and 1787 combinations later. I got frustrated and used a jewelers saw to cut through the connection to my computer .this solution took only five minutes..  I would not suggest this lock to anyone who lacks the patience to try trial and error experimentation until they reach the correct combination. nor anyone attending a school with a metalsmithing program.,1,0,887
AH67CQEJ4RQM9,1291,I found a tiny HDMI jack on my the Canon SX20IS powershot and found no one had one instock locally and special order I needed to take out a loan.

AH8Q45LTCQCFJ,0,I purchesed this mount to accomendate my 32 inch LCD tv. It works fairly well. The only problem is that its swivel points are metal to metal and require a little grease to make them move eaiser. Other than that it is a solid mount for the price.,4,1,245
AH9A3Y0FHF9R4,11,These sleeves are not made for binders.  For keeping double albums. they work okay. but then there is no room for the liner notes.  If it is a single cd. these sleeves are okay. because they are really meant to hold two discs.  So the sleeves are just okay.  Not great.  I first started using these sleeves when Case Logic had their PF200 CD Drawer System.  You see. the problem here is not the product but the manufacturer.  They discontinued the PF200 drawer system with out notice.  Not cool considering that I invested in these as my storage system of choice.  Then they stopped making .at least I havent been able to find them. single disc sleaves.,3,0,653
AH9B734YE7TEC,67,This plug gets incredibly hot while my nook charges. The plug actually started to melt in two spots and burnt me when I unplugged it.

AHAJB6Y4WATM4,0,Overall for the price. I think this is a worthwhile purchase. The sheer fact that it handles 6 svideo and composite inputs is worth it. I noticed no signal degredation in use.Ive read some reviews of people saying you can use svideo or composite. but not bothsomething I dont entirely understand. I used the 6 inputs for both. some are used for svideo .DVD player. Sony Playstation 2. Sega Dreamcast. Nintendo 64. while others were used for composite .VCR. original NES system.. I had no problems with this.I select the item I want to use and it works fine. Are some people trying to hook two items into the same single input? Or are some people trying to run both svideo and composite into the same source on their TVs? Well my Sony TV wont allow this. and it has nothing to do with the switcher.If I have an svideo connection in say input 1 on the TV. then I cant have a composite source connected to input 1 as well. I simply have input 1 on my TV be for the svideo out feed from the switcher and input 2 on the TV for the composite video feed from the switcher. Audio is output to a receiver. so all set.Overall I am very pleased with this item and feel it is a worthwhile purchase. Now I havent tried the programming feature yet. but I can sure handle manually switching it if it doesnt work for me. Its not that big of a deal. I say. dont buy this unit for that feature. buy it because there are very few quality switch boxes that handle 6 inputs. And yes you can get cheaper switchers. which is fine for lower quality interlaced TV sets. but once you get a HDTV. you will want a higher quality switch box to keep signal degredation to a minimum.,4,1,1652
AHAW6FFH93KGE,66,Beware this is not the NOOK that Bu0026N currently sells. This is the older version of the first nook tablet. The latest is the NOOK HDHD+. That is the one that has google play store and all the apps. gaming ect.,1,0,212
AHB7U3UT7O1N2,77,I bought this camera because it was advertised to be Mac compatible.  Unfortunately. it only works with Mac OS 9 and below. which havent been produced since 2002 or so.  Also. the design of the camera is such that you have to place it at eye level .it doesnt pivot up enough. and yet theres no way to attach it to a laptop.  So you have to place it on top of a pile of books or something to have it angle correctly.Too bad.  I was hoping it would be an inexpensive camera to use in talking with my husband overseas.,1,0,515

You would think that somebody at Amazon.com would have noticed that the power cable did not match the GPS!,1,0,374

AHEP4N0XIJR1K,0,The nook tablet is great.I have used it to check email.browse and look at books.and also transferred one from my p.c.I like the way it will sync with the direction its rotated.and I love the touch screen.Thanks Amazon!,5,1,218
AHFJQOHGJRK84,12,This is my first tablet. I can see it is not perfect but it basically does about everything I need to do. It seems like every tablet has its pluses and minuses. I like the highlighting in multiple colors on this one. My primary intent in the tablet was for reading.,4,1,265
AHGGNAIT6BH5X,0,Needed Headset for watching and editing videos late at night so wife could sleep. Worked just as expected . did not need anything fancy or  with exceptional sound. They are  light and the sound is good enough for video editing on the computer.,5,1,243
AHGHCKCYDPD33,44,The only thing bad about this product is that the cord is much much shorter than the original one.  I cannot move around with it I have to sit stationary.  However. at least it charges my HP touch pad. and at least it works!,3,0,224
AHHN8N4ZUAPXA,0,I was pretty excited about my Nook Tablet. Thought it was a good price. had the expandable memory. and android giving access to a vast app market and nice user experience. What I got was an updated firmware that limited me to only being able to use Bu0026N apps and an extremely limited version of the market that is virtually pointless. There are barely any free apps to simply amuse myself with when bored .including ones that are free in the traditional market like angry birds and such.. all the thing can really do is function as an ereader and play some movie files. With this in mind. I regret not getting a Kindle Fire. or shelling out a little extra for an actual tablet.,1,0,680

AHHRTEW5ICW6S,0,This radio is great! It does everything it was advertised to do.It doesnt have the bells and whistles of the digital radio. but if you are having problems pulling in long range AM stations. this radio is the one. I took it with me on vacation. Even the FM stations comes in every clear and the sound is fantastic. I plan to buy another one and give as a gift this Christmas. This radio is excellent for this price. Do not be afraid to purchase this radio.,5,1,455

AHIQBEU4J1GNT,0,The verticle lock broke on first use but was quickly replaced for free.  The spotter scope is in a really stupid six point screw mount that is hard to adjust.  There is no eyepiece holder cover to prevent crap from getting  into the main optics.I put a small plastic bag over the opening..  That  aside its a nifty and easy to use scope.,4,1,337
AHITRQS5GAKC4,4346,I first purchased this product from a local WalMart.  I was so excited to find a system with a turntable at all much less with all the other popular functions.  It is truly the perfect audio system! I decided to purchase  another for my motherinlaw. as a Christmas gift.  WalMart had sold out  of it. and didnt forsee reordering so the search was on.  I hate to think  of the time I wasted on line before looking at amazon.com  I had almost  given up.  I want to thank the GPXYorx co. for such a wonderful product  and amazon.com for helping me find another one!,4,1,562
AHJ67NJKYWK7W,5358,My son leaves for college next week. and may never use this lock. In the instructions. we read about the tamper proof feature. If someone tampers with the lock. youll see a red line on the lock. and NO key will work. The instructions are to call the 800 number. which I did just to see what the next step we would take. We were told that we would have to call a locksmith. and Kensington would pay up to USD80 for the locksmith.So lets say my son is at the college library with his locked computer. He gets up. and someone tampers with it. or maybe some of the kids are just fooling around with it. When he returns. he cannot unlock it from the library table. So now he has to call a locksmith. and wait. possibly missing classes. What if the library is closing. the computer would have to stay there. What if he cannot get a locksmith for a day or so. the locked computer still sits at the library.We bought a combination lock.,4,1,928
AHJJVB6AKA9RY,57,I was very disappointed . it was not in as good as it. Claimed to be the screen blinks and and will not let u read the books  that I  bought for it ...

AHJSXW8673Q6G,2,Well. if you havent heard these yet then youre in for a treat.  Just hearing them will sell you.  Ive had mine for 11 months now and I anticipate many more tunes to come.  Everyone who hears mine asks. u0026quotIs that sound coming from just those speakers?u0026quot.  The highs u0026amp mids are transparent bliss and the crossover point just delivers the right response on the low end.  There is plenty of headroom on the low end to give you a good clean thump without breaking up.  I will recommend these to anyone.  Very nice.,5,1,530

AHKT9ALJ3T2Y3,0,While it doesnt have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years.

AHLB8KRBRQDUY,11,You wont regret buying this one. Ever wondering which one to buy. Sharp MT821 or Sony R55 .also sold by Amazon.com.?  Go for this one. With the same dimension. though costs more. you will get three times batery lifetime .12.4 hours.. It feels solid in your hand. No whatsoever skip ever  experienced. This one is a musthave. By the way. the unit has the 2nd best  ATRAC chip of all MD recorders. It is only topped by MT831. ... Happy buying.,5,1,441
AHLG2119L3A90,46,I bought theses wireless headphones because I wanted to be able to walk around my room without the constraint of a wire and still be able to hear my music.  These headphone have allowed me to do that.  I think they are impressive with only a few drawbacks.  The clarity at high volumes is a little distorted but that is to be expected  with a wireless device. I walked around my buidling to test the range and at about 100 feet I started getting distortion and loosing the signal but I was expecting that.  I live next to a airfield so there are a lot of competing signals and there are a lot of cordless phones in my area but so far everything is good.  I believe I got my moneys worth for my first pair of wireless headphones.,4,1,728
AHMTP8ZGOHUO4,22,Operation is fine if you follow the instructions to the letter.  The jack will work for Dish with a DSL line if you put proper filter on and keep it away from other electronic devices and cords.

AHNBY13N8W2MX,11,On 242000 I received the Sony DVP330 for my birthday. I have only used it a couple of times so far and I love it I have not had any problems with it so far. but I have read a couple of other reviews on it and some people have had to return it at least once or twice due to a sync problem with the  audio and actors voices on screen. I hope I dont expierence this problem.  but I am still a little nervous.,4,1,405
AHOUP9GE9CG5U,1421,I ordered 2 of these cables to use with my new LCD TV. Order placed on late afternoon on Sunday June 24.  I received them on Wednesday June 27.

AHS0K6SDIWEP,0,A very economical way to power your 123a powered night vision and lights. These batteries hold a long charge and recharge well. Greatly reduces the cost of using nonrechargable batteries. I would purchase this product again and recommend it as a stromg buy.,5,1,257

Im a boater u0026amp outdoors type u0026amp really require a radio that picks up from a long distance.  Battery life is phenomenal. water abuse easily tollerated to the Extreme ! They last forever.  You may ask . if so. why have you had so many ?  Good question.  The answer is .1. they dont float. .2. they dont like being run over by my truck. and .3. unfortunatly others also admired my GE3  when my back was turned !The best quality is GE kept to the KISS theory with this design. Keep It Simple Stupid ,5,1,671
AHUBHTMBGXKO,55,I got a Sony MVCFD73 Mavica Digital Camera for Christmas and have used it a lot since receiving it. It is an excellent camera and I certainly would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a Digital Camera at a reasonable  price.However. a couple of points about the camera. First. the LCD view  finder gets dirty and scratched easily. There should be a cover for it when  not in use. Second. it is almost impossible to see the view finder when  outside in bright sunshine. making it hard to take a picture. Cannot see  what you are viewing. I think it would be nice if Sony had put a regular  view finder on the camera for taking outdoor pictures.,5,1,650

AHWHBI7DY4P8K,0,I wrote an earlier review critical of this mouse.  I found out from Microsoft that the OEM version sold by Dell is NOT made by Microsoft and might be slightly different. though it is made to Microsoft specs.  That may explain why I really liked the Dell version and I do not like the Microsoft version.  I recommend the Dell. though I didnt see it offered on their web site for separate sale.Also. the Dell software has a few minor added features than does Microsofts.  .e.g. Hit the ctrl button and it highlights your cursor..,2,0,527

AHY2KG32696ES,0,I bought this player about a year and a half ago.  It worked great .for about 3 months..  It played all the DVDs and CDs.  Unfortunately. it cannot read VCDs or CDRRWs.  For most people that doesnt matter. I guess.  However. only after about 3 months of light usage. the player started to actup.  Sometimes. it wont read the DVDsthe player indicated u0026quotno discu0026quot in player.  I unplugged it and it worked after replugging it 1 minute later.  Then. it doesnt work again. and I repeated the same procedure of unplugging.  Finally. I sent the player back to RCA.  Since it was still under warranty. all I had to do was pay for shipping.  It came back after about a month.  It worked. and then I started to see the problem again within a couple of days. I was confused.  Why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work?  So. I tested it out to see the prob. myself.  It appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak. and being unable to read the disc. I thought. could be due to the fact that RCA had provided a weak motor part.  I was half right.  I removed the plug from the UPSpower supply and plugged it directly into the wall.  Ever since. the player was plugged directly into the wall. it shows no problem.  I think I may have found a solution .for now.the difficulty in reading the disc. I concluded. was due to lack of power .believe it or not..  Well. if you have the same problem. try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player. It might work.Beside this. the machine is good.  It played every single DVDs Ive ever rented or bought. I have this hooked up to my reciever through TosLink .optical cable..  The sound is excellentgood proportion of sound from center. satellite. rear and subwoofer.  It plays CD but it takes a second or 2 to skip to songs.  Basically. dont expect it to play it like a real cd player.  It sounded just as good though.  The picture quality is excellent.  Eventhough I dont have an HDTV. I could still clearly see the improvement over the VHS. or BETAMax tapes. Im getting rid of it now because I want a new and better player that also plays VCDs.,2,0,2124

AHZ2BKOKBBJ4O,0,The price was good and it was here quickly. I put it in my camera and so far so good. well see as it goes along.,4,1,112
AHZLQJZQK1UDP,0,I have last years model of this camera. The entire line of these Digital8  cameras is great for the average family or amateur videographer. There are  many plusses to these cameras. First. they use cheaper Hi8 MPME tapes with  1 hour of record time. Image quality is great  not as good as higher  quality prosumer or pro cameras  but still a MAJOR step up from VHS. Hi8  or any other nondigital camera. The firewire interface makes bringing  footage into your computer a snap. Youll finally be able to edit those  home movies that have been collecting dust on your shelves over the years.  The camera records the date. time. exposure and other information to a data  track on the tape. That means you can see the datetime stamp when you play  the footage back without burning it into the actual video. My only critique  of this camera is that fastforward and rewind speeds are a bit slow.  theres no control over your audio levels. and little control over shutter  sped...but those are more prosumer options. anyway.,4,1,1016
AI09WWRK2VTHN,44,I am very disappointed in my Nook.  It is WONDERFUL if all you want to do is read an ebook.  It has great quality of text and is wonderful to read outside. even in the sun.  But. thats just about all it does.  I am really surprised by the lack of technology and thought that went into the Nook.  There are few Apps to add....actually none.There is no dateappointment calendar. which should be a basic App. I would think.Internet use is slow and cumbersome. and verizon email .which I have. is not supported at allThere are only two games. and chess is of no interest to me.I do like the fact that my library supports Nook which is the main reason I purchased it.Just think low technology.  I plan trying to sell my very new Nook asap.gailBarnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader .WiFi only. . Black u0026 White.,1,0,805
AI09WWRK2VTHN,29,In my opinion the Nook rates a 5 for reading pleasure!  Clear print. easy turn of pages. no glare in reading outside. Love it for reading.  But my love of it stops there. My disappointments are that Im now carrying this new toy in my purse. but cant use it for anything other than reading.  Cant get my Verizon email on it. has no date book. has no way of adding notes of things to do .simple text app.....so. in addition to my Nook. I also have to carry my ipod .which has a wonderful notes app and can get Verizon email.. and my big ole calendar to access my many appointments.  Very disappointed that Nook doesnt have other apps to add to make life a bit more organized.,3,0,673
AI11GN4BW4VJO,11,After having several cheapo shower radios in my life. I decided to spend a little extra money on this one.  It was definitely worth it. The preset stations allow us to push a button to tune in our favorite stations for each member of the family. No more having to stop and dial tune after some one else listened to it in the shower.The unit seems sturdy and has held up great so far to the shower splashes.,5,1,406

AI4C0UTOQJICR,12,No qualms about the player itself. but the Audio Manager program is very shaky depending on your system setup. Though I had the minimum requirements for running the prog. it flickered repetitively after clicking on the u0026quotDevicesu0026quot button. and the Rio would stop responding after spending so much time fighting with the prog. Heres my basic setup for interested buyers.HP Pavillion 8500 series Pentium 3 666 MHz proc.  64 meg RAMYou may wish to consult others who have similar computers and see how well the device runs on their system. My biggest problem with the Diamond RIO. and perhaps a problem that will ultimately lead me to averting all further products by this company. is their lack of technical support. I initially emailed them about the problem. and they replied with advice that I had already tried. Immediately after. I responded. explaining everything I had tried as well as the behaviour of the equipment. Two weeks later. I have still not recieved a response.,3,0,990

AI6K4BCDLMFIB,22,I recently took one of these to the Wind River Range in Wyoming.  Performance was fast and flawless. with one irritating exception. the onoff switch is so sensitive that almost anything that touches the face of  the keypad will turn the receiver on.  If this happens in your pack. the  result is dead batteries.  Ive called Magellan about it and had to leave a  message.  So far. I havent received a reply .which is also annoying..  I  checked at REI. where I bought the Blazer originally and theyve had  several complaints about this.  It also seems to be a problem with Garmin  receivers.Philip Lohman,3,0,603

AI7H8YZU6NY7I,1718,As someone who works in the high tech environment I am  exposed to a variety of PDAs with coworkers and clients. I  have used a number of different devices and have found all  of them lacking. Well now I have what I consider to be the  best PDA available. the Psion 5mx. I did a lot of research and  came to the conclusion that this was the best value I could  find in todays market. What a delight to enter data with a real keyboard. To be able  to download Word and Excel files from my office desk top  computer to the 5mx and work on them while I am traveling.  Meeting with a client and being able to make changes to a  price quote because I have the spreadsheet in my 5mx.  Lugging around my laptop was always a pain. the 5mx gives  me the access I need to files while I am away from my desk  in a neat little package. A great operating system. bullt in programs that are fast and efficient. no longer am I kept waiting for the Windows hourglass. It is expandable with Compact Flash cards. .the same type as you use in a digital camera. so they are much less expensive and easier to obtain than a PDAs  manufacturers proprietary card. There is a lot of software  available on the net. much of it freeware or shareware. This  is a great PDA designed for someone who is serious about  having a real business tool without all the marketing hype.,5,1,1347

AI835WDWGZ6T,0,This unit does do what it says and it works flawlessly with my Vtech phone. My 2 recommendations for this unit are. 1. longer cord.maybe another 8  would help when walking around doing things and. 2. the ear attachment leaves a lot to be desired. You have to fold your ear lobe and insert it into the loop shown in the picture. Its not a tight seal to the ear so if your talking about someone better make sure theyre not withing earshot! ..  All in all I like it as it suits my needs for a Vtech hands free unit.,3,0,512
AI8W25EVC726E,11,The wireless speakers work well. with much greater sound quality then I expected.

AI9PCH3117X2G,1,All in all. the Moleskine Kindle DX Cover is a classy product  if a little pricey. It adds a lot of weight to the package but the protection for the device it affords is essential. I have only one complaint. the notebook sits on the left side of the open cover. the Kindle on the right. Being righthanded. when I want to write something I end up with my right armelbow obscuringtouching the Kindle. Flipping the cover around means the notebook is upside down....One simple solution to making the package ambidextrous would be to create another opening to the flap where the notebook back cover can be inserted  by having a flap both top and bottom on that side of the cover both left and righthanded users could make notes more easily. Apart from that. a fine product.,4,1,768
AI9WGV6NNUSKK,0,I bought the StreetPilot because I was moving to a new city and never wanted to get lost.  As soon as I began using it. I couldnt believe how accurate it was.  However. it does take a long time to get satellite signals. will require car power .otherwise you must remember to shut it off along w your car.. and requires separate map data.  The separate map data available on CDROM is the major problem.  The StreetPilot III. I believe. comes w the CDROM and cartridge.  It .and the memory card. is a separate purchase for this unit.  Without the map data. the unit is only useful for traveling on major highways across country.  Still. if youre willing to fork over the cash. the maps and GPS are accurate and the unit is a great conversation starter for your passengers.,4,1,770

AIE5ROZQ3BPV1,1314,This is the best ballgame listening device Ive ever had. After reading the reviews. I concluded it was not 100% Waterproof. However. I just put it in a little plastic bag. paddle out to a buoy. tie up and listen to the game. Water has gotten on it several times and it has responded fine. I do take the batteries out and dry them if it has gotten really wet. so as to avoid the corrosion others spoke about in their reviews. I am going to buy a couple backups in case they stop making this thing. It is very rare to find a product that actually exceeds your hopes.,5,1,564

Not cheap but a class act.I record all my original CDsAlbums onto CDRs and it has played them all without hitch. Its very quick to change from one CD to another and the transport noise is not too bad. and certainly not offensive likes some.Lovely unit and cant wait till they bring out an MP3 version. Can you imagine how many tracks that would hold!! ..A worthy 1010PS. Some people have complained after a few years it has trouble reading some CDs.

Unlike the USB to Palm adapter. this device is priced fairly .almost too cheap..This adapter works perfectly with my PowerBook. I havent had a problem with it. and you cant beat the price.To those other people who rated this low. I dont think this adapter deserves a 1 star. just because some people ordered the wrong ones when they really wanted one for a USB based Mac. Thats like saying you dont like Toyotas because you tried to buy a part from a Toyota store for your Honda.,5,1,567
AIGR5SN4PLK1P,22,I really needed another VHS Head Cleaner. and went with this brand because Im currently using that. and theyve been effective. Ive tried to use this one. and it just hangs up in the player. at least in one player. will try it in some others I have later...for the price its just not worth my effort to return it.....,1,0,316

AIHY3MHTEST64,0,At first I read the reviews and figured that since the primary reason I was buying this product was because I had to replace the original. flimsy USB charger for my Nexus S. this would be better fitting charger.  The reviews are correct. this charger does fit well into the phone.  But.when its plugged in. the phone thinks its docked and when its unplugged the phone still thinks its docked. which limits some of the functions of the phone.,1,0,441
AIHZ3Q0LU3GYK,0,I will make this short for you! If you needwant a great digital camera get the Coolpix 950. Play with the settings. It does not take long to learn. I didnt need the manual. Click away. no film to waste .. I had a Sony Mavica! I dumped it soon after the purchase. Trust Nikon. they know  what they are doing!,5,1,307
AIIDW45VPE1ME,1426,Amazon.com is the only place in the world that has the Amperage rating for this adapter.  Not on WDs site. the user manual. the quick start. the product brochure. etc...  Thank you Amazon for providing the information that is actually required to turn this sucker on.,2,0,267
AIJ8ZHYZLOUKZ,712,My Palm V has worked flawlessly since my purchase in September of 1999. The device is very well made and is one of the few electronic devices Ive purchased recently that fully delivered on its promise.On a Windows 98  laptop. the synchronization worked flawlessly the first time outofthebox  and every time since. I have also successfully .i.e. without glitch.  upgraded the OS so that the HotSynch is faster.I dont normally rave.  but my Palm V is everything I expected and more. I have found it to be both  intuitive and reliable. It is rugged .I have dropped it on concrete. and it  has been rained on countless time. albeit briefly. and very easy to use.I had initial concerns about the amount of memory. but those concerns have  been allayed. In addition to all the addresses. appointments. and emails of  a busy MBA student. every day I download. auto.com. Bloomberg. Business  Week. Fodors .Chicago.. ExploreZone. The Financial Times. Hoovers IPO  Update. The New York Times. The Wall Street Journal. and TheStreet.com. And  I still have more than 30% of my memory available.,5,1,1082
AIJEH7L0SGFVQ,4343,I bought this because I love animal prints. I love black and white color combinations. and I need a case to transport my iPad to and from different places.  It is a nice case. I love the print. and its different from anything else out there.  However. I found that my ipad shifted around in the frame of the case.  When I folded the front flap over. the ipad would slip out slightly.  As a result. I bring my ipad places with this case. secured with the magnetic closure. When I use my ipad out and about. I take it out of this case.  I may be purchasing a neoprene sleeve for my tablet as a back up and for days when the weather may be less than ideal for electronics .rain. snow. etc..It is a bit pricey considering its shortcomings.  I should have spent a bit more for a more secure portfolio. or a bit less on a sleeve.,3,0,823
AIL5GWJGUN7VG,0,Unpacked it.  Connected it to USB.  Driver installed successfully.  Will it read a 3.5  floppy?  No.  Not even close.  The thing is a toy. worthless piece of junk. like something youd buy on Canal Street.  Caveat emptor!,1,0,220
AIMBMZN64GOLT,23,This things works GREAT when it works.... After the auto program feature was tried and only picked up my Panasonic TV. I managed to manually program the Toshiba DVD player.

AIMMNC6I8D867,33,I got my Nino more than 18 months ago and I love it. I finally have all my addresses and appointments in one place. I had a change to play with a Palm V a while back and I still am happy I bought a Nino. I would like to see a  CE device the size of the Palm. thats why I only gave the Nino 4 stars.  but the extra options in the standard programs of the Nino make it a better  choice for me. I especially like the huge amount of data fields in the  contact database. I just recently started using the modem. It works great.  I can check my email now at any phone. Be aware though that Philips stopped  producing the Nino and also no longer supports it. I have not had any  problems with this. and there is a good user community that you can query  with questions.,4,1,763
AINY7L2N8BR5Z,1718,I bought this item for jeep trail rides. to be able to communicate back and forth between the other people in my trail group. I got to try it out yesterday and it works for that. Transmission was very clear back and forth between us. Weather channels come in great also. I hooked the cb up to a 4 whip antenna mounted in the back of my jk.  I havent tried it out for the mobilewalkie talkie feature. Im not positive how well this will work out on the road. I guess it all depends on what antenna setup you have. When I first connected the cb to my whip antenna I wasnt picking up anything at my house. just static. So I drove by the highway close to my house. parked and was able to pick up people talking. I couldnt tell u what range they were at though. Overall Im happy with my purchase.,4,1,790
AIOHY2H8ZY8I3,0,This hard drive presents every issue of Playboy in great fidelity.  It is very convenient to use and makes every issue readily accessible.

AIQ6ATP5VGQA1,33,I use this with my Note II fairly frequently.  Sometimes it works great. while other times it seems like it has a short in it.  Connection will randomly go in and out and it can be pretty frustrating.,2,0,200
AIQBAZT7U91XJ,0,If you look at the Tech. Data on the AV2000. it says it puts out 33mm. but that would be false since some of the best headphones out there put out that much. and I mean studio stuff.  So I looked up these headphones on another site. and found out that they are only 13mm. and a ... cheaper.  I cant tell you where. but you might want to look before you shop.  This does not make these bad headphones though.  I might just buy them.,2,0,431
AIRAFE37XPJ60,14,Good construction and quality. Earpiece stays on tight and is comfortable. Mic is flexible and stays in its place. Would buy another set.,4,1,137
AIRPOKZ4206EG,1,Before purchasing a wall mount for my Hitachi 31  flat screen TV I took the time to read several customer reviews .which I found extremely helpful..  I ordered the VideoSecu Swing Arm TV Wall Mount after reviewing my TVs Owners Manual and measuring the mount connections on my TV.  The wall mount arrived much sooner than the estimated delivery time.  Installation was simple.  The price was right.  I would highly recommend this product.,5,1,438
AIRRQ3NET7CRM,0,This is a nifty little device.  It works well and has a nice large display.  It also has a voicemail indicator if you have phone company voicemail.  The nice thing about this box is that it will pick up CallerID from Call Waiting no matter which phone you happen to be talking on.  That way you will have a record of all your calls.Drawbacks.1. It is very easy to hit the redial button accidently which will either dial the currently displayed number or the latest call and there is no way to abort the dialing on the unit.2. No backlight3. Calls are counted individually rather then uniquely.  The 64 call memory actually says 68 according to mine. but these are not the last 6468 unique calls I have received but the actual last 6468 calls I have received.  Other devices I have will keep a count of unique calls and it takes much longer to overflow their memories. This is however a good purchase if you just want to have a display that will get Call Waiting calls and you dont want to spend a lot of money.,4,1,1010
AIRZATK3BXK3I,55,Its been about a month since I got my Palm IIIx. Since then. Im more organized than Ive ever been. I decided to get myself a palm pilot for two reasons. I hated having to manually update my monthly planner whenever a  new year rolled in .things like birthdays. anniversaries. etc... Another  reason was because I wanted all my contact information to be in one single  place.  I had these info spread out all around me like a wild fire .some at  home. at work. in the bathroom. ah... just kidding on the bathroom. but you  get the point. right?.. With this Palm I can have upto 12.000 people in my  address book .I have 100 so far and Ive been telling people that the  10.000th person to go into my palm address book gets free dinner from me.  ha.Now. then the reason I bought Palm IIIx over visor and other Palm  products was due to various reasons. I did a intense research to find out  which product would best fill my needs. Visor had the cool design going and  maybe cool features like modules that can be added to turn your visor into  mp3 players. etc. But from what I found out. these feature were not being  fully utilized just yet .maybe in one more year someone said.. The reason I  went w IIIx over other versions .e.g.. V. VII. was because it had 4 megs  of memory plus the price was right.Ive downloaded a lot of programs and  installed them into my palm w ease.Ive only had a problem once and  that was when my palm was HotSync.ing. w my computer and something  happened and it kind of froze. However. I was able to u0026quotsoft  resetu0026quot easily by pressing that little button in the back.Overall.  this is an excellent all around product even for a first time user. like  me.bingolian,5,1,1706
AISHAAD4WMEM4,3134,I have a normal size head. but the headset sits above my head. it doesnt hug the top of your head u0026 you cant make it any smaller.  The cord was a great length u0026 the sound is fine for working out at the gym.  just wish it wasnt so high on my head.  Was bummed because I have looked all over for a foldable head set.u0026128513,3,0,333
AIT3DTQ8RH2RW,0,I asked other buyers before I bought this if it would work for iPhone 5 and everyone said yes. Well it DOES NOT work with iPhone 5 and even a 4S. I tried both. The jack does not fit all the way in the phone so if you have a song playing it keeps stopping and cutting it off. Very annoying and not even worth trying it. It only works if you hold it still in a certain spot which. obviously. you cant do while youre driving. Really bummed about this purchase and wish I could return it and get my USD10 back. Just wanted to write a review to let all the iPhone users that it doesnt work despite what the others told me.,1,0,617
AIT3KLQ2691DL,24,Great Cable.  This cable is very rugged to use. the tab protectors are great since is really protects the tab.,4,1,110

AITI7JNYCBX7D,0,I picked it for securing personal folders. It is truly adorable and works the way it is supposed to. It is a little heavy to wear as a necklace,4,1,143
AITP0JGYPQ2L6,0,I tend to spend a lot of money on things I dont need and then regret it months later. But this Nook Color was worth my money. Ive read so many new books and theyre all there at my finger tips in case I want to read them again.I love being able to adjust the screen brightness while Im reading instead of having to go all the way to the settings. I also love how unlike other readers there plenty more to do on this. Its like a cheap tablet. with plenty of apps to choose from and entertain you and I love it. Connecting to wifi easy. and once your in you can buy a book from barnes and noble without having to leave your bed.My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy but other than that its perfect! DONT THINK ABOUT IT JUST BUY IT!,5,1,734
AIU8YRECU4HZ4,12,The ETX90EC has magnification of 48X great for looking at the moon. However. if you want to look at any planets or stars. you _definitely_ need the optional eyepieces so you can have some control over magnification.  Without these optional eyepieces. you have no control over magnification.,3,0,290

AIVPBPQ6F3KAX,0,I bought this as a gift for my sister. and since she popped it out of the box. she hasnt put it down since. The display is simply beautiful and the touchscreen is responsive. but not too sensitive .unlike its predecessor the Color. even with the plastic still on. The only downside  if you can call it that  is the accessibility of the library. But still a great buy!,4,1,367
AIVRNZOTO3F2P,57,These tapes work well  have had no problems whatsoever. In the absence of TiVo and DVD Recorders. blank VHS tapes like this one does the job.,4,0,141

AIX974QOKM8RU,14,Fast. light and the USB connection is great.  The only real problems are the volume control doesnt go loud enough and the control knobs are not easy to u0026quotfeelu0026quot in you pocket so you can control the unit while  jogging without looking.,4,1,248
AIXDWB9Z11KGD,66,Just installed this drive yesterday. and havent had any problems. Floppy drives are fairly obsolete these days. but theyre a useful tool to any college. or high school student. as we require the ability to move files  quickly. and everyone doesnt have Zip drives. I definitely reccomend this  product to anyone looking for a replacement drive .like I was.. Its cheap.  and it works...two important things. One warning. to all you  notsocomputer savvy folks out there...it comes with no installation  instructions. so be sure you have a way to get it in. Thats all for now.,4,1,572
AIXN43Z8S5KWQ,1112,I bought one of these about 2 years ago. It was a great improvement over several others I had tried. The others would die after a few months. The 2 C Cell battery life in this SONY is well over a year. I use it every morning during the week for 10 to 20 minutes. You can tell when the batteries are going low. the signal drifts off frequency. I have a small shelf in the shower stall. just perfect for the radio to sit at an easy to  listen to height. There is a relatively weak radio station I prefer to hear. that is in between 2 other stronger stations. With a little antenna adjustment. the station is very clear.  I like being able to set the count down timer so that it will go off by itself after Im out. The Clock is large enough to see without glasses and its pretty accurate as well. We have water with a lot of minerals so deposits were building up on it. I just used some cleaner my wife uses on the shower stall and it came back looking great. ready for more use.There are cheaper radios for the shower. even some with CDs. I cant picture getting the CD out after youre done with the shower dripping wet. unless of course your trying to learn a foreign language or listening to a book on CD and you really need to hear it for the 5 to 10 minutes youre in the shower.I just bought another of these SONY shower radios for my daughter for Christmas 06. The last shower radio she had .not a SONY. gave up the ghost many months ago after only a year of use. You get what you pay for..  Good luck with your choice. This radio will be one that pleases.,5,1,1558
AIXP7ITIV0219,33,Had no problems for the first few months and then in the middle of a movie. it stopped cold and reverted to the startup screen and acted as if I had just inserted the DVD. Had the same problem with a few DVDs but lately. they have played ok. BIGGEST problem has been starting with the first stopping. I now have a scratchy sound coming from within during the playing of a DVD. There when powering up. after retracting the tray when empty and throughout the entire playing of the DVD. Not as loud now but still there so never made it a priority in getting fixed. Contacted RCA ...and since Im nearing a year now. Id have to pay for repair or replacement...And to add insult to injury. their offering me a Service Contract... Was considering it until reviewing...comments so I could get it fixed or replaced but not now for I dont want to get the problems Ive reviewed...Id be royally ticked off now if I had bought this player but since I won it. Ill just use it until it dies and replace it. Provided I dont replace it first.,2,0,1025
AIY3UQZB0XWIS,11,I bought one of these for my father after seeing how great my roommates was but after 23 months both of them started flickering and would freeze up from time to time and now my fathers only plays about half the DVDs he  owns and my roommates cant get through 20 minutes of a movie without  flickering then locking up.  I found out from talking to people on the  internet that about half of these units have MAJOR hardware issues.  Buyer  Beware.,1,0,445
AIYJVTMU58D9H,991,It took a few passes but eventually the VCR was playing like new. Not sure if that was just because it was so dirty that it needed a prolonged cleaning. but either way I am satisfied!,4,1,183
AIYLJ1UWTL012,0,When I opened the box. I said out loud. u0026quotWow.u0026quot It looks a little different than in the picture. It came with almost everything I needed to record from any source. except. for a minijack connecter. And I dont like that UTOC Error either. I havent seen it much. or recently. but after I record a few songs  and the error comes up and the songs arent there. it gets me really ticked  off. This only happens occasionally. I still  gave the 702 4 stars because its really easy to record. it has great  sound. and its at a convinient price. Simply put. this machine is one of  the best Ive seen.,4,1,605
AIZ4QR2RTJPWY,0,I have one of the ORIGINAL SUPERADIOS. For the price it is a GREAT VALUE !!! But by the time they got to the 3 model I would have thought there would be some improvements made. a LED Backlighted frequency scale would be nice. and a more accurate frequency indicator !!! BUT NO. as far as I can tell the 3 is identical to the original. I will stick to my original and my CC RADIO EP and my Grundig S350.MattGeneral class HAM radio operator,2,0,438

AJ0R8AX9FETYG,1515,I was so excited to get this as a gift from my son. but was so completely disappointed.  This nook was returned within 24 hours.  This is NOT a tablet.  This is great for an ereader. but you could save yourselfs the USD50 and just buy the Nook Color.  While this has a great feel to it and a decent browser. there is nothing you can do with this outside of purchases made in the Barnes u0026 Noble bookstore. if they dont have it. you dont get it.  And as a side note. the Bu0026N app store. not only do they have very little. there is very little free.  I did manage to sideload the Amazon App store. however. it ONLY works on the microSD card.  Some of the apps kept crashing.  I didnt find any difference between the Nook Tablet and the Nook Color.  This is most certainly NOT a tablet.  Find something else.  I have had much better luck with the Kindle Fire.,2,0,862
AJ0RVZBI80FZK,24,this product is definately a best buy.  Its inexpensive. but has great quality.  I also love mp3s,5,0,97
AJ1BWOZWHMOE9,14,I bought a cheap literati at first. when it broke. I opted for the nook 1st generation. its completely useless. For books I previously had for my literati .which was color btw for only USD15.. it wont let me use their covers. it wont even show the covers of the books unless they came from Bu0026N. then the problem with brightness. I realized that it would be poor. but its soooooo bad that it hurts my eyes to look at it. kinda defeats the purpose of an ebook.. i wanted my books for night time reading without disturbing the husband. this one is useless because I need a flashlight to read it.,2,0,596

It is a perfect size for a u0026quotpoint u0026amp shootu0026quot type digital camera. such as the Olympus D360L. The front of the case zips open on both sides to reveal a flap with mesh pockets suitable for a spare set of NiMH batteries. cables or extra memory cards.

AJ6SPK7Y38RKW,0,As the picture shows. you loop the lock through a stable object then lock it to the laptops security slot .some notebooks wont have it. I have an Dell Inspiron which has it..If you leave your notebook computer unattended and there is no one around a determined thief could just break it off of the security slot attached to the computer.  It doesnt feel too stable there.  They would have damaged good however.  This prevents my notebook from being walked away with when I am at the library.  Its worth paying USD30 to protect a USD2000 toy.,4,1,541
AJ6SPK7Y38RKW,3038,I have bought two of these for home and office use. They work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality. I was running at least Windows 98 on all computers I hooked up to the ethernet hub. Windows makes it easy to set up file and printer sharing.After you are hooked up to a network you will not need to swap disks all the time in order to exchange information or to move files for printing. You can transfer a hundred megabytes in a minute or two depending on the kinds of files.Setup is a breeze if you have ethernet cards installed already. Even if you do not have cards installed already there are instructions to walk you through step by step.  By the way. if you are just using this for a home network. pick out the Netgear hub combo that gives you the most stuff for the cheapest.  I have bought at least 3 different ones and the all provide the same functionality as far as I can tell.  It is just that sometimes they come with one more port. or an extra cable. or multiple speed compatibilities.,5,1,1024

AJ7GOBURILNOF,0,I purchased this because I was basically afraid to take my kindle anywhere without the case. and I love Moleskine notebooks.  The surface of the cover is soft... not like a normal Moleskine notebook.  The top left elastic strap does .minorly. interfere with the operation of the on switch.  It doesnt really bother me all that much though.  I have had mine for a week or two now. and it still has a chemical smell to it.  Be prepared to let it air out for a while.,3,0,464
AJ8442MRRYE7Y,12,Had my GF get me this tablet assuming that there would be a plentiful selection of thirdparty ROMS and other hacks like the Nook Color...WRONG.For whatever reason .some people speculate NetFlix content protection. the Nook Tablet is bootprotectedrequires a signed bootloader so it will not boot off an SD card like the Nook Color. There is currently root support. although the 1.4.1 update may or may not break this.Shame on Barnes and Noble for not embracing the success they inadvertently gained through the Nook Colors ease of hacking. The technical specifications are very good considering the price you pay. but its unforgivable to prevent people from turning the hardware into a much more usable customized platform.Sigh...on to the Galaxy Tab...,1,0,752

AJ8KO9QBCP0UG,0,I am resident in India and own a Palm Vx.  The original power supply operated at 110 volts and required a converter as the standard mains voltage in India is 220.  The supply is defunct and I need a replacement.  The cradle and the com port connectors are okay.  I desire that the new power supply should operate at 220 volts.  I hope this is what you mean when you say that it is compatible with UK. Eurpoe etc.  However my original power supply had a five pin socket that fitted on the back of the serial port connector.  The one shown in the picture has a differently shaped output.  Will it fit into my existing cradle and serial port connector. or do have to replace those units too?I will be glad to place my order and write a review of the product after getting the desired clarifications.,1,0,796
AJADA1TL1QL9,0,It works. but if you expect much more you may be disappointed.The PCTV features no deinterlacing at all. leaving image quality in the poor bin.  Even on slower moving video it can become annoying.  For basic functionality it works.  It features RF tuner. svideo. and composite inputs all which work fine.If youre strapped for cash it will work. but if you can stand to spend a bit extra. the money may be better spent on an ATI TV Wonder or competing product.  Its hard to rate it too low despite the image quality for the...price. so Ill leave a Three behind with a word of warning.,3,0,583
AJANAWYR8GMXK,11,This seems like a nice idea. being able to have a CD player and AMFM tuner is a thin package.  Can can be mounted on the wall or put on an included stand.  Ive seen highend versions of this concept and they seemed pretty cool.I received my SLIM1500 free. using credit card points.  That said. I was a little surprised when I opened the box.  Its plastic and not very nice plastic at that.  From a distance. I have to admit. it looks cool.  Up close. it doesnt look as good. but its not too bad.  Touch it. however. and youll feel something pretty cheap.Given the thin speakers and the low speaker wattage output. youre not going to get great .or very loud. sound. although its acceptable for casual listening.  Im not an audiophile and my room setup is suboptimal anyway. so the sound is fine .although I would have liked some additional volume..I hooked up my CD changer and the speakers made terrible popping noises.  I have the reduce the sound output from my CD changed to the minimum to get rid of this problem.The radio works as expected and the single CD player does what it needs to do.  The vertical layout of the CD player is sometimes hard to use .I have my SLIM1500 on a bookshelf.. but looks neat when the CD is spinning.The surround sound mode does nothing.  I can detect no difference.  Ditto for the dynamic bass.  Which brings me to the basstreble buttons.  They do nothing!  Since the volumebasstreble levels dont show on the display. I have no idea what they are doing .if anything..  And. except for volume. using the other controls gives no sound difference at all.  Maybe you need a subwoofer .for the bass. at least.?In the end. this is basically just a clock radio. although an interesting looking one.  It pales in comparison to the lowend .its one of those USD200 u0026quothome theater in a boxu0026quot things. Dolby Surround .5 speaker. receiver that its replacing.  In the end. it does the job for what I paid .USD0.. but you can do much better for a few dollars more.,2,0,1997

AJD3GO8ELVCEA,0,We still have enough VHS tapes for viewing by the grandkids that we did not want to give up on a VCR just yet.  Unfortunately. this one came without a manual and was old enough that the manual online was not for the same model that we purchased.  The remote was an aftermarket controller without a manual .although I did find that one online..  The bottom line is that we can play VHS tapes for the grandkids but we cant record anything because we cant set it up to receive the cable signal without the appropriate manual.,3,0,522
AJEVEDS9QMBG4,22,These things cost around USD20 at most Bu0026M stores. so this is a great deal.  Maxell is also a great brand name.  Ive had 2 others for my car cassette player. both of which worked well. but broke after a year or so.  Sound quality is good. the cord is not too long. and so far no issues.  If this lasts more than a year for me Ill upgrade the review to 5 stars!,4,1,364

AJIC64C630FTT,45,I worked at a rather wellknown booksmoviesmusicgames store a year back. and upon a customer purchasing anything GPX. we either  chuckled or groaned. Chuckled because we knew that the GPX line of technology is made for the customer that values price over usability and  quality .laymens  terms...GPX is ...... and groaned. because we knew wed see the unit back  in the store for a full refund a day or so later. If youre hearts set. by  all means get this player..but if you see yourself playing with it a year  or so down the line. forget it. Try Panasonic .the Shockwave line is  great.!.. but one of the most expensive. or Sony. who is good. too.,1,0,648
AJIEYYB8CT9D,5266,I did a lot of research on the different ebook Readers before purchasing my NOOK.  I went back and forth between Amazons Kindle and Bu0026Ns NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library. Google Books. along with Barnes u0026 Nobles selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive. but once I got the hang of it. it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK. which I have maybe a tiny bit of. but were talking maybe a second or so. so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK. but to me its a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local Bu0026N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  Bu0026N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.  The Kindle does not offer that kind of service.  All in all I am very happy with my NOOK and would recommend one to anyone looking for an ebook Reader.,5,1,1704

AJJHOVXGWZKPB,12,Where to start?  Ill begin by saying..get the Palm V...Everytime I open it up. conversations start about how organized a person I am.  Once you start relating to others about tech features. youre sure to close the  deal.  I dont know if its the great gasp or the real deal.  I do know  this I have been able to think less about what my day is like and smile  more knowing I have more free time due to proper planning using the Palm V.  The custom software available online and support you receive from the  company is a great combination.  If you make palm piloting a habit. youll  sleep better at night knowing youve got everything planned ahead.  Your  only decision left to make after buying the palm organizer is which case to  buy to carry it in.  I chose the Coach leather.  Holds a check book.  business cards. credit cards and cash...enough padding to protect your  investment. Buy this so it will make everyones lives easier by  u0026quotBeamingu0026quot business cards instead of passing them out.,5,1,1007
AJJV9Z17KV6GR,1923,Hello radio lovers!  I have  a vast collection of radios and many many years of radio listening and purchasing experience  I can do accurate compares which many find helpful. When I purchased this radio I so wanted it to be great like the old days of Grundig . Its not bad . but I wouldnt go out of my way to reccommend it over others . The Sony sw7600gr and the Sangean ATS909 are much better buys . Heres why . first off the Grundig YB400pe is generally not made very well . The poor quality of the body . the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen . The tuner sensativity on FM is good but AM and SW are fair . The side band set up is ok . others are better . One draw back is that it takes 6 AA batteries while the others take 4 .This makes the radio very heavy for its size . True that the Sangean 909 and the Sony 7600 are a little more expensive but worth it . You are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound . So I guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so good.,3,0,1074
AJJV9Z17KV6GR,4650,Hello folks its Vince the radioman. I have been a collector and a buff for many years . love to do compares . This radio is generally ok no major complaints . The tuner quality is good . although you can only tune down to a 5kh increment.. Much better quality than the G2000a.  The sound is a bit brassy but clear. Its a good little travel radio and for the casual user its certainly worth the money .I would rate this better than its competitor the Sangean ATS 404 . It has a little bit of a better tuner . better at noise reduction and it has an external ant. jack which is always a plus . Not the best radio for DXers because of the 5kh increment but you can still get some fairly decent results . Grundigs construction quality leaves a bit to be desired . be careful its delicate!!. but all in all not a bad little radio . If you get a sale buy it.,3,0,852
AJJV9Z17KV6GR,1616,I have been a shortwave buff and radio collector for many years . I have a large collection of radios . Grundig over the years has made many good products .however . the G2000a is certainly not one of them . I will concur that it is beautifully designed .has nice leather case and the FM section sounds decent . The AM and SW sections are practically useless . Lots of interference and noise . Only can pick up strong signals and I have experienced fading on those stations . DXers should pass it by!,2,0,500
AJKRBA25NOLVQ,33,Ive owned one of these for 5+ years now. and when I recently needed another power strip for another room I did a bunch of research and found some cheaper alternatives that were well reviewed. but ultimately decided to purchase this colorcoded model again. Call it silly. but I like the rainbow color scheme. It keeps me organized and adds a touch of style to the jungle of wires under my desk. It does come with colorcoded wire ties. but I lost them in a drawer somewhere. Ive never had a single negative issue with this product. and if I ever need a third power strip Ill definitely buy this one again.,5,1,603
AJLD8AEDL0O6U,33,After buying a Bulldog alarm I lost my transmitter. I accessed their internet site and it was very plain and unfriendly. It had few options and no explanation of what to do.

AJNA9O3FC9G01,0,I was extreemly disapointed when the headphones I specificaly asked for christmas for had to be charged for 24 hours but being a aircraft electronics technition I understood that nicad batteries require a full first charge and if you dont do this the first time you risk weakening the batteries ability to fully charge in the future wich could also be the cause of some other people having to retune their headsets so frequently if the batteries are dying the frequency changes. Anyway I waited untill boxing day to use them when to my utter disapointment they had a lot of static I did the usual try eaverything technique and found the base station needs a strong signal to function properly. so I turned up the volume. At last I was hearing beutiful music it was just as I had hopped clear loud comfortable phones and just then buzzz I retune the headset buzz i retune it again but eavery 5 to 20 seconds I get an 800hz tone in the headset but I discovered it goes away when you have constant sound Like the radio. This completely ruins the use I had intended as a computer Headset so I reinstall it to my steriotv amplifier. it sounds great for 5 minuits untill my head rests against my chair buzz again I get all sorts of buzzing retuning does nothing. Advents website is useless for techsupport so I call the phone number on the base station and they tell me its interference from my cordless. So I unplugg my cordless and sure enoughf it quits but wait without the phone I cant receive calls ect. This headset is doomed to sit in its box while my girlfriend feels bad for buying me a .bad. gift. I feel bad for asking for it and the only thing that makes me feel better is writing the review Im a technition and I know they could have designed this phone to filter out external noise they just didnt do it probable to save a buck at my expense. Thats my two cents,1,0,1869

AJQ3XQ77EJYVH,48,Ive had a case for 9 years which finally failed.  I ordered this case expecting it to be the same as my first case.  That assumption was based on the picture and description shown on AMAZON.Buyer BEWARE. What I ordered and what I received were not the same. It only took about 4 hours for me to be ready to throw this case in the trash. Its front creased the first time I put it in my pocket. It depresses the scroll button when you shut the lid and drains your battery as well as scrolls into the twilight zone. The clasp is a joke and opens wo resistance. The corners are sharp and gouge whatever they touch. I will have to admit. however. it looked good on the website.Im looking for a replacement.,1,0,701

AJTXGUUWED6J,22,I carefully researched all of the minidisc playerrecorders under USD200.  After looking through all the possible playerrecorders I chose the sharp 722 because of its great price and features.  This playerrecorder has all  the features youll find on a higher priced minidisc.  The 722. like all  minidiscs. has the ability to play Mp3s easily from your computer.  It  also has a digital input for recording an optical which i found very  useful.  The only draw back is that its a little thicker than most MDs but  not enough to make much of a difference.  With great sound and a good  price. this is one of the best playerrecorders out there.,5,1,641
AJU65EFIV0IVG,44,If you dont want to spend a lot of money but want good sound. this is the head set for you!  I like to play my piano while my husband watches TV just five feet away from me.  He doesnt hear me nor do I hear the TV...unless I stop playing.  The sound is great for the price.  The cord is extra long so it doesnt interfere with my keyboard.  This product works for me!,5,1,366
AJUBTKA978SIG,2929,I used this to play my Creative Zen MP3 player in my car .Toytota Matrix. tape player. The sound was very muffled and I have to turn my stereo volume way up to hear it at a good level. I would not recommend this device for this combination of MP3 playercar.,2,0,257
AJUMOWGI0REI6,45,The KDS VS7E is an affordable alternative to those expensive 17 inch monitors.  It has great .27 dot pitch resolution. a bright and crisp 16 inch viewable screen. and vivid colors.  It works great with my everyday  applications such as MS Word and Internet Explorer. but it also performs  extremely well with my 3D games such as Quake II. Tribes. and Expendable. I  like this monitor very much because it has all the great feutures of more  expensive models at a price most can afford.  A great choice for the budget  minded consumer.,4,1,534

AJYGQV81FSFE2,0,This seemed like such a great idea. music that wont skip I can record what I want. Then I got it.The software is far more complicated than it needs to be. and its unbearably timeconsuming to put everything you want on the machine.Then it theres not enough memory to record all youll need for a long enough stretch.I could go on for pages but wont waste your time with it. My last straw. however. was when. after Id purchsed some additional memory. the lid to hold the battery in wont close. So the little. grandly overpriced toy is a total waste.Stick to your CD player. Maybe its not all the uptodate. i.e.. the hitech industry has replaced it with this little thing. But youll enjoy it more.,1,0,693
AJYHA46YONBMI,46,Ive had this radio for over a year now. and I drag it all over the house to listen in every room.  It has done very well in the shower. up on a shelf.  Better than any other Ive tried. and worth the price.,5,1,205
AJYHFAGV9EF6O,22,Lots of people complain about this players few faults.  First of all. who cares if it gets a little bit hot?  All hightech devices that have to  decode DVDs. display a picture. and spit out sound gets hot!  Its a fact  of life!  If you dont like how hot it gets. put the thing down instead of  holding it!  Second. its not a  better deal than a laptop.  A laptop that  could play DVDs would be 2 or 3 times as much. have worse sound. and a  choppy. slow picture unless you spent 3000 dollars on it!  And who wants to  lug around a heavy. ugly laptop and boot it up. stick it on your lap and  watch part of a movie before the battery runs out.  Anyone would rather  have something sleek and palmsize that plays movies. and pay less for it  then a laptop!  When you get down to it. laptops arent as portable as the  DVDL50. so why settle for it?  This player. for its size. features. and  prices. has hardly anything wrong with it.  Its about time that we can  watch digital movies on the road or in the air. CONVENIENTLY!,5,1,1020
AJZDH3LR4QS5,4851,When I saw the other rviews I just had to say something.  Weve had a pair of these for several years and we love them.  They do not like having mobile phones around but otherwise they are great.  I dont know about speakers quitting working. etc.. but I wonder if those folks batteries went dead.  We did have to replace a battery once.,4,1,335
AJZRG0DTIQP2Y,55,I ordered two of these speakermics for my pair of Motorola MJ270R HTs.First. the good news. The sound quality is good in both receive and transmit mode. They seem to be rugged..this turned out to not be truesee update below.. maybe not quite as tough as speakermics for professional grade radios. but above average for a consumer grade product. Ive only had them for two days at this point .9.15.2012.. so Father Time will be the ultimate judge.Now the notsogood news. Like a number of reviewers. my main issue is the length .or lack thereof. of the cable. I hope Motorola takes a serious look at this issues and corrects it in future versions. Along with this. the plug doesnt connect very securely. so you have to be careful how much you stretch the cable. I found that out the hard way. .Ouch!.Overall this is a good product. If the cable length and the plug issues were fixed. it would be a GREAT product.UPDATE 10162013. Both of these quit working about six months ago. The issue here is that in addition to not fitting in the jack well. the wiring at the plug is not soldered very well. I would not recommend these for heavyduty use.,3,0,1139

AK0EO4QYKL3UQ,11,It was okay while it worked.  Sound quality wasnt great but it wasnt terrible either and microphone quality was decent.  The inline volume control and microphone switch were convenient.Unfortunately it didnt last.  The main problem was the cord.  Despite being rather thick it developed bad connections in many places.  The volume control also became scratchy.  Finally one of the drivers broke.  Because of all these problems I cannot recommend this headset.,2,0,459

AK2XW27R76ZTC,0,I bought two of these for use with two Garmin nuvi 1450  units. In my opinion. it is unfortunate that the Garmin nuvi 1450 requires extra storage capacity to handle updates I think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the United States and Canada. I dont know yet whether I am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and I dont know whether a bigger card is available.,4,1,440
AK3D1F2TEULT0,0,As everyone should know. any HDMI cable should be the same besides a few minor differences in version so I bought this cheap HDMI cable rather than expensive lies at retail stores. etc. I have to say that I am very satisfied with this product. You get a long cable that you can connect your tablet to your TV and still have the tablet not too far from you. The sound and video works perfectly. I havent tested anything HD yet like 1080p movies but Im sure it would work.So I would recommend you buy this if you want an affordable miniHDMI to HDMI cable that works and is long.,5,1,576
AK3QJVKPMM4P9,0,I found the portable range to be about the same as a kids walkietalkie. but when installed in my rig with a proper antenna it works great.  Love the scan feature and the fact it has NOAA all in one unit.  Great buy,4,1,214
AK4FE9SMLQRX6,22,Before you consider this product   Do you have an EPP parallel port scanner with a printer passthrough?  If you answered u0026quotyesu0026quot be prepared to either add a parallel port to your computer or scrap your  scanner.  This product uses an ECP parallel port.

AK5ULCFBGMBAN,13,This was my first DVD player. and Sony really inpressed me with this high quality. low priced product. It seems to perform just as well as the high priced models. and it contains all of the features that make DVD watching  great. It is simple to hook up. and easy to use. It contains a wide array  of connectors so you can find the optimal connection wether you have a  plain tv or a home theater.

AK7IBSLK7UK6G,4243,I reciently purchased and installed the Entrega 4 port USB Hub.  Dispite the illeterate manual the installation was rather streight forward.

However. as an advanced MSWindows  user I had no trouble installing the software.

AK8JH4EZ800HV,2023,I just got the LG Octance phone from verizon wireless. the main reason I bought this phone was for the sd card feature so I could put all my music on my phone and be able to listen to all my favorite songs wherever I go. its extremely handy. Im glad I found this sd card so cheap. with an in store credit the phone only cost me five bucks and after buying this SD card the total cost of having my music with me at all times is less than twenty bucks. Thats a whole lot cheaper than an ipod and I can remove the sd card and put it in my mp3 player. Soon Ill be buying a cd player for my car that has an sd card slot on it. Id definately recommend this product. it is very useful ..,5,1,680

When I went online to look for a replacement drive I discovered that internal drives are pretty expensive. at least when your short on cash like me.  Then I went to Amazon and discovered this little external drive that looked good and was still in my price range. I bought it and hopped for the best. Now that I have received it I have to say that as of this moment I am very pleased with it. Some people on here said that the quality and construction arent that great but I have to disagree.  The drive and case seem very durable and it was incredibly easy to install. just plug it in and it starts working.  I have tried all kinds of CDs in it and all of them work well. although one of my games made it run rather loudly.  Id have to say that the only con to this drive is the two 2.0 USP cords. if you are running it on a laptop like I am it kinda gets in the way.  When I was looking in to buying this I was a little worried because nobody on the internet said anything about external drives playing computer games. but now I know they can.  If you are looking in to buying a external drive for this purpose dont worry about it not playing games because this little drive did really well. its just like a internal drive except its not in the computer.  I have to say I am impressed by the quality of the drive since the price was so low. I am also really happy with how fast it shipped.  I live in MI and it arrived here all the way from CA in only two days.  I havent tried any DVDs yet so I cant say anything about that. but if I have a problem with the drive Ill by sure to update for future buyers.  To sum it up I would like to say thank you to Power Optical and Amazon for a terrific experience and I hope to buy again in the near future!,5,1,1901

AKEZPC7QY0Y0Z,11,I bought these in the hopes of using them both in my home office and for picnicsjust bring along a walkman. plug it in. instant outdoor concert.Well. not quite. Although the speakers can be batterypowered .requiring  8 Ccells each.. the transmitter cannot be. unless you are adventurous  enough to splice a power jack into the power cord and build a suitable  battery pack on your own time.I found the sound from the speakers to be  OK but nothing special. I often thought there was some barely perceptible  fuzz. Tuning has not been a setandforget affair. people moving nearby can  knock the signal out. And 900 MHz cordless phones produce really bad  interference.The industrial design on these is pretty stupid. with the  battery hatches actually screwed in placemaking them very inconvenient if  you plan on running them on battery power with any regularity. They would  also benefit from more smarts. so that you only needed to set one volume  knob .instead of three. and with automatic frequency hunting .my phone can  do it. why not the speakers?.. This would all drive up the cost. but it  would be worth it.Id recommend these for people who want a set of  speakers they can haul out on the deck once in a while for barbecues and as  a remote set of speakers for the bedroom or office. or for situations where  it would be really inconvenient to run a speaker wire .but youll still  need a power outlet nearby. really..,3,0,1427
AKF5CB5ZNMT7T,4242,I purchased two of these. and found that GMRS radios work better and at a much greater distance.  These are great CBu00268217s when you are within 1 mile of oneanother.  Greater than 1 mile even within sight. without obstructions. this radio doesnu00268217t cut it.  I purchased the SWR meter and the external antennas and tuned both radios.  But after several tunings and testing. I still could not obtain anything over 1 mile.  Then on top of that. I live near the Mexico border and found that my signal is being drowned by more powerful radios.  Yes. I am assuming that the CBu00268217s in Mexico are using more than 5 watts. that the US FCC has limited us to.,3,0,663
AKFH8TF46MW49,11,I bought my Wheel Mouse about a year ago.  This is probably the best mouse you can get at a good price. Its like a Microsoft Intellimouse and a Microsoft Basic Mouse combined into one. keeping the Intellimouse Wheel and the Basic Mouse shape and feel.,5,1,251
AKGLME8U3VEYR,1616,I basically have this same model listed except mine only has 10 seconds of antiskip I was hoping to find some info on my particular model but I think from the information listed I can believe that my model is just as good.  I  would be interested in hearing from anyone who has information pertaining  to my model of cd player thanks.,4,1,334
AKHYKWTADKZTY,24,Although I love it and found it to be more useful than I had expected when it would not turn on or activiate after two months of use I felt lost. ripped off and up a creek with out a paddle.  Would 3com upgrade to the  latest model  NO WAY !  Did it take 10 minutes to speak to someone in  customer service  count on it.  It may be too early for this technology to  last and USD300 plus for a 2 month day planner will hurt you just like it did  me !  You have been warned !,2,0,473
AKI4H6ME7KU6U,2338,This drive is the Sabrent SBTUFDB also sold on Amazon with a new sticker over the barcode. They dont even bother to hide it on the product itself. That product has substantially worse reviews than this one. This sort of manipulation should and very way may be illegal.I had the same issue that many reviews of the SBTUFDB had. it did not work at all and may have damaged my irreplaceable data.,1,0,393
AKIISBP4LSSH5,35,A great DVD player with superb quality.  There are no annoying lines traveling across you screen either.  If you have and SVideo connection .with is on most newer TVs. I suggest you use that.  However there are RCA  jack connections.  I lpve the sound too.  If you have a good stereo on your  TV or the external speakers its like having the same experience of a LOEWS  Cinema!  Words do not express the greatness of it.  Get it and see for  yourself.  Oh and it also plays CDs and maybe CDR.I havent tried CDRs on  it yet..,5,1,523
AKIISBP4LSSH5,1417,If youre looking for an easy to use. highly compatible. USB MP3 player this is it.  It may lack an FM radio or organizer like others have but the same and its quality make up for that.  If you want an FM player I suggest getting a Walkman by Sony or Aiwa.  Audible is now compatible with  the Rio and has many interesting types of audible content.  I have  personally used my Rio in other ways than in my ears.  I have hooked up an  optional Riotocassette adapter. which you may already have or have to  purchase. and listen to it in the car or in a stereo system.  The  software is the best of its class.  If Im not mistaken Im sure it uses  Winamp technology for its sound. which makes it well worth it to listen to  it on your computer too .the Rio 500s quality is just as good if not  better..  My collection of MP3s ranges over 200 so I advise anyone  who gets this and has a vast variety of enjoyable music or audible content  to have 1+GB of space available on your system.  Thats nothing for newer  systems.  The Rioport software which is included allows you to.  rip tracks off of CDs. burn copies of Cds if you have a CDRewritable  Drive. have a playist. copy songs to your Rio. browse the Internet. convert  MP3s to .WAV format. etc.  I would highly suggest having an Internet  connection as it is very helpful.  Also the headphones on this  piece of equipment can blast up to wazoo and its max is way to high for  anyones ears. Thats more used for auxilary output anyway.  The menu on it  is easy to use yet I would suggest keeping your Rio up to date.  When you  buy your Rio it comes with 64 MB of space on it.  You can store 1 song up  to about 40 depending on the bitrate .ex. 64 kbsec. 128 kbsec..  When you open the box you get as follows. A USB cable. the Rio 500.which  has a back lit display so you can see it when it gets dark and read the  track info and other info.. the earphones. a users manual. coupons for  online music related stuff. a small case that can be clipped to your  pantsbelt .yet the Rio is so small it fits in your pocket..  If  you want to listen to more songs you can buy smart media cards... and add on an  extra 120 songs proportional to the bitrate.  Your songlist on the  Rio is dynamic .changing. which means you can delete and add songs at any  time.  If you are a music lover this is for you.  Oh I forgot. THE  MUSIC NEVER SKIPS because there are no moving parts.  Believe me it is a  must!,5,1,2441
AKKBYT8HGON3C,35,Im increasingly pleased with my NOOK Color. but it wasnt easy to get going with it. First. I couldnt decide between the NOOK and a Kindle. but as my wife had a NOOK and was very pleased. I decided to go with that. When I got it. I was very excited. I turned it on and was instructed to find a wireless network to start with. It found my wireless network. I input the password. and nothing.... It wouldnt respond. It wouldnt take my perfectly legitimate password. Im supposed to be a minor techie. but I couldnt get it to respond. which ticked me off. However. my wife did something to it  I dont know what  and it took it and my wireless has been fine since. .However. yesterday my wife lost HER wireless connection although every other wireless connection in the house was fine. so she had to restart her NOOK. which seemed to work.. Then. after I was in my new NOOK. I looked around the store some. downloaded a book. magazine. and a few apps. and then wondered how to access libraries to get free books to read. There were no instructions anywhere. although I know people do this. My wife did it. for Petes sake! Well. she told me I had to download an Adobe app called Overdrive Media Console in order to access libraries and library books. How in the world I would have discovered that on my own is beyond me and I think it stinks that theres not an easier way that Barnes u0026 Noble could have built into the device. Nonetheless. I downloaded the app. It wouldnt install. I was about to pull my hair out when my lovely wife came to my aid once more and got it working. I accessed my local library. where I have an account and downloaded a book. However. when I went to other libraries to check out their selections. I found that they charge fees. like USD50 to become a member just to download their books! Thats crazy! What could it possibly cost these libraries to have out of townstate members download their books? What a ripoff. Anyway. I started using my NOOK and havent had any trouble since. Just a bumpy beginning. I like reading magazines on this device. Thats the whole point of getting Color. isnt it? The Article View is a nice feature and makes it easy to read magazine articles. Its very different. however. when it comes to books. That is. its easy to read books Ive bought and downloaded  just choose them with my stylus. But to open a library book. I first have to open my Overdrive Media Console app and get through several screens before I can begin reading. Oh well. I have my email enabled on my NOOK. as well as my Twitter feed. DropBox. and Pinterest too. It would be nice to have a Facebook app. but it doesnt yet have one. so you can use the built in browser for that. Its also possible to upload pictures and songs from your computer. but I havent done that yet. The NOOK is light and its easy to read. for which Im grateful. You can modify the screen brightness. which was important to me. I havent tried out newspapers yet. but hope to soon. Oh. about magazines. Individual issues can be pricey. but if you subscribe. they have pretty reasonable fees. Most cost only USD1.99 a month. which is a huge savings off the individual price for both NOOK and paper issues. Its a good deal. It seems to be a good ereader or tablet or whatever theyre called these days and after getting by the first hurdles. Im now glad I bought this product and heartily recommend it to others.,4,1,3404

AKO60ISIM7N7F,7073,I have used the PS110 for SCO UNIX systems with netcat forseveral clients with complete satisfaction. Netcat makes  aconnection to port 4010 or 4020 and sends data without errors.However. I have just recently .Dec 2002. placed a PS110 with aclient in a Win98 network to print from FoxPro 2.6 for DOS andhad to remove it as its 64K print buffer is too small for theFoxPro reports to be printed without error.NetGears web site has a technical document indicating that theproper procedure is to capture the desired LPT port and directit to the print server as PSDXXXXXP1 for parallel port1 orPSDXXXXXP2 for paralle port 2. .PSDXXXXX is the hostname thatshows up when you browse network neighborhood.The PS110 that I delivered to the client had BIOS version 6024.while the Netgear web site listed 6017 as the latest availableBIOS that can be downloaded.The problem with buffer overflow on the PS110 using the Windowscapture setting appears to be a problem with Windows 98 and thetimeout Win98 appears to allow for captured print jobs tocompletely spool to the target host computer. If you use captureand send to a shared printer on another Win98 system. the file isspooled to the host win98 system in under a second. Sending thesame file to the PS110 takes over 20 seconds and results in anerror message indicating problems writing to the printer. andthe remaining lines from the print job are lost or garbled.Testing using nc.exe .from Hobbit. to send from a DOS windowunder Win98 to port 4010 is sucessful and takes several minutesto print my 7page test file.Netgear second level technical support admitted the problem andcould provide no solution as the 64k print buffer cannot beincreased.,3,0,1689

AKRMMUONNBMLJ,0,I purchased this radio to listen to WFAN out of New York city about 400 miles away. I was dissappointed when I first set up my radio and couldnt get it. I moved the radio over about 10 inches and it came in crystal clear. The sound on this radio is great for not being stereo. I have only had the radio for a short while so I cannot remark on the longevity of it. However like the other reveiwers I will agree that the buttons and switches do appear a little chintzy. If want an am radio this is a good choice.,4,1,510

AKZG20TOVLTJ1,2424,I was initially set to spend a lot more for a DVD player. assuming that it would be hard to find one of high quality for less than USD400500.However. after reading many reviews and talking to friends who already  had DVD players. I chose this one  not for its low price. but for its  quality to price inverse ratio. It has lived up to its hype since the day I  unpacked it and set it up .in about 4 minutes. looks and sounds brilliant.  without any problems whatsoever. Truly a great deal.,5,1,489
AKZG20TOVLTJ1,1720,Dont have much to add to the alreadythorough reviews that have been written about this superb hightech piece of machinery. but I would like to say that having never used a digital camera before this one. I found it  incredibly easy as well as fun to just pick it up and start shooting. The  manual really doesnt contain much helpful information. but learning as you  go has been a breeze.Ive found that with our tripod. the Nikon 950 also  takes perfect Ipix pictures. .Whether you want to buy their stupid keys or  not is a different story.. The battery life doesnt seem to be too long.  but I dont even find that worth complaining about. If the 990 is even  slightly improved from this one. it must be the absolute top of the line.,5,1,733
AKZG20TOVLTJ1,99,If you back up files on CDRRW. these are great. I dont personally carry 200 music CDs around with me. but when buying CDs for data storage its always a pain to have to buy jewel cases as well. This book eliminates that  problem very handy. if slightly overpriced.,4,1,263

AL0K7MEC7RWJ4,24,If you are in the market for a top name VCR. you owe it to yourself to consider this one. Quality. simplicity. and pricemake this THE best VCR you can buy. The picture is crystal clear. even in pause mode. Slow motion and  fast fwd are equally clear. Setup took about 10 minutes. If you have a home  theater system. put u0026quotSaving Private Ryanu0026quot in this VCR and pipe it  through your surround sound speakers.

AL2XB3XNNUV9J,46,Lets just say this will never be iPad or anywhere close to it. That said. it is never meant to compete with iPad anyway! IF you compare this with Amazons Fire. its a closer comparison. Frankly. this is better than Fire. Hands down. NT has better hardware specs and it shows when you start browsing internet with heavy imagery or picture ebooks or emags. The complaints about NTs wallgarden OS restriction is very true...so is Amazons Fire!Its not the end of the world. just root the device and you have in hand a functional tablet for USD250 that is rather spiffy. This doesnt get a 5star rate because 7inch form factor is the biggest drawback compare to the OS lockdown. Personally. 7in tablets is too small for serious computing usage. It is a good reading form factor though. I cant give this a 4star rate because Bu0026Ns app store is too small...even when rooted. Googles Market Place is filled with crappyjunk apps.,3,0,921
AL425G9XIL52H,11,I wanted to make some mpeg videos and edit them for power point talks. The problems started with trying to capture video from my Sony 8mm. Finally. after reinstalling the driver three times I was able to get it installed correctly. Then I tried to copy some video clips from 8mm to the computer.Unlike some other users I found I could transfer to the computer without a problem through a USB interface even though I have a USB keyboard connected. Also I found that I could adjust contrast. brightness and color successfully and the quality of my videos were improved significantly. You do have to have the DVC connected with the source on when you load the u0026quotMovieStaru0026quot software to manipulate captured clips.Ive no idea why...its in there FAQ but cant find that in the manual.and I had to close out all the other running programs but Windows Explorer to make this work. This is on a machine running an ABIT BE6II and an intel 700MHz CPU with 512Mb of ram.But the supplied u0026quotMovieStaru0026quot captureediting softwares editing functions wont work and the program remains unstable. I keep getting errors like u0026quotUnable to build temporary movie for unknown reasons.u0026quot Of course I read their FAQ and the manual .no section describing the problem.....no troubleshooting section.. So far. I am unable to do anything with the clips but trim the ends to shorten them. To do this I have to u0026quotproduceu0026quot a new clip for each editing function. I cannot combine clips by inserting transitions. And it still crashes the system....even with nothing else running. I suspect it is not compatible with my GeForce 256 video card.  So I emailed their u0026quotsupportu0026quot address through their website ..... explaining the problem and got back a computerized response. Then I called their u0026quotsupportu0026quot number .long distance.....not an 800. and was put on hold with the explanation that the California phone system was on the bugger implying that if I couldnt get hold of them it wasnt their fault. So. I left them a voice mail message with my office number. They called and left me a email where I was supposed to be able to get email support from them .anthonyp@dazzle.com. which was returned to sender.Dazzle also handles u0026quotMainActoru0026quot franchised from a German software firm. Cant get it to combine more than two clips. Nothing back from u0026quotMainActoru0026quot support either.I dont think Dazzle is responsible for making their software and hardware compatible with every machine. But I do deplore their inability to communicate even a modicum of support.If I had it to do over I would purchase a Firewire card with capture software .for a little less then I paid for this device. and edit the clips with additional software. Such software is expensive .USD300  USD2000. but likely has better support. Im thinking of purchasing the Adobe program. The DVC is adequate to capture clips as MPEG and adjust their quality.George Richardson MD,2,0,3004
AL4WX7LL4ISYK,89,I have a very early model 42in flatscreen. The specs say the TV weighs in at 52lbs. i also have my soundbar mounted below the tv so thats another 5lbs or so on the mount. Im pushing the limits of the mount with damn near 60lbs which the mount claims to support and so far it is. The arm does flex a good amount right at the middle connection but doesnt seem to be failing.I have moved the arm in all positions. straight out. flat against wall and anywhere in between. Does have that  flex  to it but nothing has gotten worse over time so im confident that it is a sturdy product... just has me a little on edge because it looks unsafe however feels good.Make sure to mount this into a stud in the wall... if your relying only on anchorsdrywall and you have a heavy tv like me there is no way it will stay.If it breaks ill let you guys know,4,1,839
AL54DG59QHZDU,0,Ok. some loyal review readers might know that I have the original RIO PMP300. I have basically the same opinion about this player.GOOD  Lightweight. small. decent on battery power. no moving partsBAD   Holds  about 44 minutes at 192kbps .almost CD Quality.. somewhat priceyUGLY   USD100 for an extra 32mb card .22 minutes of almost CDQuality.. Bad memory  clusters cause skips over timeSo. unlike my review of the PMP300. with  this model I have to recomend not purchasing this item. For this price. you  are MUCH better off buying a MiniDisc recorder from Amazon.com! .dont  worry Amazon. you arent losing any business. You can purchase blank  MiniDiscs for USD1.50 now. and that gives you much more then you get with the  Rio for USD100 in flash memory .the blank media that music is stored on in  the Rio. So. in short. go with something like the Aiwa AM F70 MiniDisc  Recorder. I guarentee you will thank me!,2,0,912
AL54DG59QHZDU,2021,I purchased this product for a wopping USD220 US as soon as it was on shelves... I know. kinda a silly thing to do.

I was eigerly  awaiting this product.GOOD  Lightweight. small. quick to upload  toBAD   Somewhat flimsy design. display is hard to read. holds only 6  songs at CDQualityUGLY  Bad memory causes skips over time. extra flash  cards are super expensiveSo. my suggestion. if you want something that  is cheap. consider the Rio. at under USD100. to be a great substitute for a  tape walkman. If you can afford it. go with MiniDisc. otherwise buy the  Rio. keeping in mind that it is NOT a great alternative to a CDDiskman. or  an MDPlayer!

One thing I notice is.when using reverse mode.while in play. it has to think if it wants to do that. It will.When power fails...No Problem. All stored memory is still there when power comes back.On screen programing is great and easy to use.I like it and think you would be happy if you had this unit.,4,1,445
AL5MKEHGSVUO0,33,I got this Rio PMP300 for my birthday. and I love it!  Its lightweight. and has a belt clip so I can wear it and do whatever I want to .walk. run....and it still wont skip.  It has a very long battery life .about 12 hours with one AA battery.. especially if you use Duracell Ultra. which is  included with this.  The sound quality is surprisingly good considering its  portability.  However. Diamond has decided to distribute earbud headphones  with the Rio now .not the ones pictured here.. and their quality is not  very good.  The music will sound better if you use another pair of  headphones instead.  There is a hold function that disables all buttons  when it is turned on. which is extremely convenient for me. since I carry  the Rio around in my backpack where other things sometimes accidentally  press against the keys and could turn the player on.  The Rio does not play  wav files. but that problem can be solved since wav files can be converted  to mp3.  The PMP300s memory is less than what I would like  only 32MB.  Flash cards can be used to expand the memory. but they cost even more than  the Rio itself .with rebate. it is a great deal.!  The software included  with this is easy to install and use. and will convert your CDs into mp3s  for you.  There is also a CD sampler with lots of mp3 files on it.,5,1,1323
AL635KJYMZ71K,55,It didnt come with the extenders like pictured. You also have to off center the screws that go into the stud because they all dont fit onto the stud.,3,0,149
AL6D7X05KVWT5,0,If youre thinking of buying a portable MP3 player such as Diamonds Rio. think again. This product is for you. Not only can you easily record MP3 using a minijack cable from the back of your sound card you can easily  record CDs using a minijack to rca cable if you have an older stereo. or  use the optical cable provided for perfect digital recordings. I finally  have a product with the capabilities of making a mix of CD and MP3 music on  CHEAP rewritable 74 minute media. MD media costs around 25 dollars a disc.  This item is so versatile I dont see why anyone doesnt buy it. My only  concern is the lack of a LCD display on the headphone remote. but I can  deal with it. I have not been able to make this thing skip no matter how  hard I try. Plus its great for bootlegging concerts with a tiny little  microphone attached. Buy this item. you wont be sorry at all.,4,1,870
AL6I2TP6IJBRU,34,Okay so home land security recommends everyone be prepared dont buy this becasue there isnt much distance you will get when this is on.  My recommendation is to purchase another brand.,2,0,184
AL6JZSQP95PH9,4,Compared To A Good Cd Player Plus all the blank Cdrs or real CDs this thing is the best purchase i have ever made. it is so small and lightweight. with the rebate it is pretty inexpensive and even at the lower  bitrates they quality is super. I can listen to all my favourites really  easily and i dont have to worry about changing the cds or cleaning a dirty  or scratched disc and i can use  a car kit to play it in my car. i really  think this is a good investment for the musiclovers out there. I had doubts  but one week with it the doubt disappeared! and oh yeah it never skips and  uses one battery,5,1,605
AL6Z5U5TT9K2U,22,I first heard about this camera from my soninlaw .who had saw it at a local department store. in Nov. The next day I went to the store to check it out and was so impressed that I put two of them on hold for Christmas  Gifts .one for him and one for me.. An added special was a free 16MB smart  media card was included. I took the instruction booklet from my camera box  and have been reviewing it off and on up until Christmas.I also located  this web site and have been readingcomparing the comments and the more I  read the more convinced I was that I made a good choice. My soninlaw and  I opened our camera on Christmas Eve. and began taking pictures immediately  and it was awesome.  I echo the comments of most of the other owners that  give this OUTSTANDING camera a high rating. P.S. We both received a small  four .4. battery recharger with 4 batteries in it plus the 4 none  rechargeable batteries that came with the camera.,5,1,934
AL8FVM9WQVELF,1618,The Nook is attached to the cover only by a side. with two supports. I think is not a very good solution. It is ok. it protects your nook. but I expect something better,3,0,168
AL8KW9OA8FFNO,23,I enjoyed using my mp3 player for about a year until I upgraded to Windows XP at home.  Eiger Labs does not support Windows Xp. so I loaded all of my mp3s onto a few zip disks and took them to work where I had Windows 98.  I have subsequently got a new PC with another operating system that Eiger Labs doesnt support. Windows 2000.  I have wrote to Eigers support email and have yet to hear from them.To tell you the truth I am quite mad seeing how I cant update my player with new songs and that I am stuck with what I have already installed on it.  Since I started writing this I have lowered my rating from a 2 to a 1 with my anger.I am sorry. I needed a place to vent and maybe this with help others that have WinXP or 2000.,1,0,728
AL8LNCULJ23WE,0,I love my label maker. Everything in my pantry is labeled and everything in our home office is labeled. Now if I could just get my label maker to do all my laundry! Anyway this was a great product. I use it all the time. however the shipping on just four of these little guys which weigh next to nothing. was USD20.00. Can you say rip off! Not too happy with the seller!  Just my thoughts!,4,1,389
AL9W9U3JCNS0H,0,no complaints a month in. Good reception. easy to use. A bit pricey. but then i am very cheap.,4,0,94
ALA0F41TEOE2P,0,I love it. Great software available. The only drawback I have found is the batteries. 2 AAA batteries are not enough. They learned and the V has lithium batteries. Oh well.,4,0,172
ALA8RE2HDEVIK,6163,i bought this with my brother for Fathers Day. I tried to help him use the product thinking that im a reasonably educated person.The main problem that we had was trying to read Google ebooks in pdf format. I tried different methods. Downloading directly didnt work. And they will tell you this too as their help desk told me. And downloading it from a pc and transferring it.Even after going to a Nook kiosk. they were unable to figure it out and they even called tech support. Apparently they just dont work.This whole process of trying to get pdf ebooks to work was soo frustrating.Other huge negatives. Not very responsive and poor battery life for something that doesnt doo much for you and isnt that simple to use.My advice. Get a refurbished iPad. Youll be happier for the small price premium over a nook color. It does so much more and is worth the price.,2,0,862
ALACFUUHCNC3M,38,I tried every possible way to get these to work properly. but could not.  This product is completely useless.,1,0,109
ALAUPXULQ016Z,23,It is not perfect. although I do live out in the country. It seems pretty well made. The sound is fantastic.,4,1,108
ALAYHS4TQVI5V,0,Works like it is supposed to. I used it in my galaxy s4 u0026 it works perfectly. I would definitely recommend.,4,0,111
ALBCCGKTUHU1O,11,If you depend on a modem to connect to the internet. you should pay for a good quality one. This external modem works very reliably and is easy to install .you will need to buy a serial cable for it.. The instructions are clear. It also comes with very nice software for fax. voice mail. email and computer terminal emulation. The modem will also work with Linux as well as Windows.,5,1,382
ALBMCTFT326N,1415,As I said above. the tapes are really worth while as I use them to record my voice and my songs that I write.  Thanks.,5,0,118
ALCQAJHQFLLG,0,I bought these for the convenience of the rocker focusing vs. the normal knurled knob.  On receiving them. Im very satisfied with them overall.  The focusing works great.  A couple of very minor issues.1.  Theyre not quite as bright as I was hoping for. but that goes with cheap.2.  Im a bit confused on the location of the  tripod socket  at the front of the binoculars.  Its a standard 14  tripod socket. but Im not sure what good it does where it is.  Really just a  wtf  more than anything. since I probably wont ever need a tripod anyway.,4,1,543
ALDBCZJ4MCF7R,0,I couldnt believe the other reviews. so I have to write one.First. I have an electronics and computer background.  So Ive been dealing with surge protection for 20 years in a number of different technical areas.  And no. I have never worked for APC or any surge manufacturer.  I HAVE seen and repaired plenty of fried equipment!!!The top review here is not even about this product. but a rant against the manufacturer.  I have seen what it takes to protect against a CLOSE lightning strike .can you say USD10.000?. and almost nothing will help if it hits your house.  I dont believe anybody would warranty replace due to a direct lightning strike .those policies are for defective units. not acts of god..  Dont be angry because you thought this thing is a magic shield. its not.  .BTW. my garage door opener got fried once too because I didnt have protection on the garage and a big bolt hit 50100 yards away.  That put a surge in the lines for 1 sq. mile or more.  That is what a surge is good for and why I have one on the garage now..There are 2 possible responses for a surge protector when it gets old and wears out.  YES! THEY WEAR OUT.  The components inside .metal oxide varistors or similar depending on type. are like little shock absorbers they absorb and absorb so much and eventually they cant take much more.  Usually this takes a couple years but it depends on your electrical environment doesnt it?  But then it can either A. pass the shock on to your equipment with you none the wiser actually. leaving you thinking you are protected .false sense of protection and asking for trouble.  or B. STOP working and make sure you realize you need to replace it!You WANT option B.  So disregard the second review.  Im glad people share their opinions. but I try and listen to the ones who know what they are talking about.Now. on to this product specifics.  The connector here is designed for a 3 prong .C6 style. laptop where your power cord plugs into the little brick power supply.  So it fits inline between the power cord and the power supply.  I like the velcro strap that wraps around this surge protector and attaches it to the power supply.  It makes it easy to lug this thing around and doesnt take an extra step to plug this in.  AND...  think about this it makes it nearly impossible for you to accidentally leave the surge behind .plugged in to the wall under the table. for example..It has connectors for phone and fax cables too.  Several nice features on that.  Looks like 180 joules. so because it is small it only has so much capacity.  Hey. a USD10 protector is cheap compared to how much time and cost and aggravation I would have if my laptop burns up.  You can carry a full size surge for more protection if you have room. this one is a great supplement and mobile.So...  no reason not to get this. its absolutely fine for what it is.Zap! hehehee,4,1,2878
ALDXG1061L8NV,1415,This product truly is easy to install. but then the database wouldnt open.  Ive tried contacting their tech support. but with no success so this product is going back to the store  Im not wasting any more time on  emails or money on longdistance calls.  btw. I got the installation tested  at the store and it did work there. so judging from these reviews theres  obviously something with the product thats making it incompatible with  certain computers.  I personally wouldnt buy this online .sorry Amazon.  because of the chance of it not working.,1,0,549
ALE9NB10L8Z9B,0,Attempted multiple times to install. eventually evein the same room.  Each time. at the receiving telephone instrument all you heard was a beep and some loud static. then nothing.  I ended up ordering a hardwired jack from the telephone company.  The only redeeming quality is the customer service from the seller was exceptional.  They refunded with no question.,1,0,363
ALEALZYRHQDEK,0,Have only used the radio for a little more than a month but so far. so good.  Love that it has a digital tuner  thats why I selected this particular radio.  My only complaint is that I think it was a little expensive.,4,1,217
ALFRDCZSP20WO,11,The item did not work I sent it back and ordered a new one from a different Co. That one worked,1,0,95
ALFZ0UI8JHJUC,33,Ive was looking for a really good AM radio for sometime. I live in the mountains of NW Maine and wanted to get the Portland and Boston talk radio stations.  I came across the CCCrane radio and was about to buy it when I  saw the Superadio in thier catalog listed as the best value for the money.  I searched around on the internet and really never found a better price  than CC because they include shipping. until Amazon had it for under USD40.  I also found several websites where amatuer radio hobbyists were discussing  their thoughts on this Radio and how they got in and tweaked it to improve  the performance and the inaccurate tuning display.  These guys all gave it  a thumbs up over much more expensive radios.  I have found its performance  to be excellent. although its rather cheaply made. its price reflects that.  I have also obtained an AM antenna called the SelectaTenna.  This has  improved the already good performance of the Superadio even further. in  fact a cheap boom box was working better than the unantennaed Superadio  with this antenna.  I would recommend this antenna to anyone who uses the  Superadio to get distant AM stations.,5,1,1158
ALGVIAEKBDQ4H,1314,This CDRW drive is excellent for anyone who has a laptop or a PC with a PC card drive. If you have no room for one of those bulky external CDRW drives that are as big as the internal ones .with casing.. if you dont  want to pay near USD500 dollars for an external CDRW drive that is this  small and basically does the same things. or if you simply have a leptop  that doesnt have a cdrom drive and want a model that will do everything  then this model is the best choice. Hey its the best choice by far.From  the time the package came to my door to the time I opened it up to the time  I got finished setting it up and recording CDs it had been only 15  minutes... The software that comes along with the drive s excellent  although I wish that it would have allowed me to convert MP3s to Wav files  for recording .youll need your own MP3 decoder like winamp.. but itll  record CD files onto WAVs .which I recommend for CD recording since  recording straight from the CD will lead to skipping..Ive heard  reviews of other external CDRW drives that are this compact. have the same  speeds .20x read. 4x CDR and 4x CDRW. and only one other model .the  Pocket Rocket. has had a better review but only for the fact that it comes  with a rechargeable battery. but when I looked at its price of USD500 I  gasped.  Paying a sub USD400 price for this model is much better than paying  USD150 more for a model in which the only extra thing is a battery. If youre  willing to forgo the battery then this model will be your best bet.,5,1,1521
ALHETC5QZ6IGV,9293,For DVDs this unit works fine. Great pic. great sound. etc. nocomplaints. The major problem is audio CDs. It will play if you putthe CD in and let it play. If you have to switch tracks. I would recommend you do so very slowly bc it will tend to freeze. I dont know. Maybe its only my unit...I would spend a little more and get a nicer one. Also mine does not play video cd .VCD..,3,0,379
ALHWZSTAELK9I,0,I have several pairs of another brand for my classroom and theyre pretty good. I bought this one to compare and it just feels a little cheap. Considering that I buy a pair every month or so. Ill try some other brands.,4,1,217

ALJCWHDYBHGSK,0,What junk. I rate this negative 5 stars. Customer service is horrible. Reason this is important is because you will be on the phone with them every other month having to order a new power cord. Never again will I do business with Bu0026N,1,0,237
ALJEBQWWJG4UT,2,I use it for downloading pictures and contacts to my PC  it does that  and as a side benefit. it charges the phone.,4,1,115
ALJMGXJ3ZZ11S,0,I purchased the EarHugger Com7000 which is supposed to be a combined headset with boom microphone.  Either the microphone arrived broken or it generates a signal that is so weak that it wont register on my computer.  In any case. it has proven to be a complete waste of money.  I am using it  with a Sound Blaster Live! card .pretty standard. on a microphone jack that  works fine with an inexpensive Radio Shack microphone.,1,0,424
ALK2HSMEKGGO4,24,I purchased this as a daily work bag.  I am finding it suitable. but it does have a few immediately obvious flaws.1  It is extremely jingly.  With all the huge metal zippers. it is impossible to walk with this thing  without making a significant amount of noise.2  It is a little smaller  than I had hoped.  Some people will probably like this. but there isnt  quite enough vertical space .esp. to fit a decent sized laptop..3  As  mentioned by another reviewer below. the laptop case is handy. but not  really large enough to hold laptops with screens larger than 14u0026quot.4   The handle straps are too thin to comfortably carry heavy loads and the  shoulder strap doesnt do a very good job of holding its place on your  shoulder.That being said. the thing gives the impression of incredible  durability for such a relatively cheap bag.  The material seems very strong  and weather resistant and the zippers are quite sturdy.  There are a ton of  well organized and nicely sized pockets that allow fairly easy and quick  access.  It also comes with a convenient .albeit wimpy looking. combination  lock.Overall. a decent value. but there are better options out there.,3,0,1171
ALKQFNJIXQYNC,2424,A few months ago. I wrote a review on this very good performer. I have yet to change my mind or the batteries. for that matter. It is annoying to have to tune. perhaps and devoid of extras. But it does the job with clear reception and good tone.I use this model every day. It is durable and an excellent value.,4,1,310

ALMK0YBTI72RL,22,This styluss tip seems to be of a harder plastic than that of the Palm IIIs .the one with a silver metal body and grey plastic ends.. Having just switched from III to V. the difference was dramatic.  I have spares of the  III type at my desk  its quicker to just grab that than pull the Palms  one out. and I wont forget to put it back.Im afraid of wearing down  my Palms sensor surface. so am shopping for a u0026quotsofteru0026quot stylus  for the V.  .The Vs are a touch slimmer. so my spare stylii wont fit its  holder..,3,0,524
ALMVBB7EFULO8,810,Got this as an additional extension for plugging a laptop into a TV at home.  There was already another of the same chords plugging the laptop in. so this was a second extension.  With a second cord the quality is reduced. but not by a significant amount.  The cable does its job and does it well.  No complaints.,4,1,313

ALNX7XV0E75CE,44,As the author ofCB Slanguage Language Dictionary  The Official .Including Cross Reference. .CB Radio Lingo.. I needed a new CB for ratchet jawing on the expressway when we go on trips. I often hear new CB terms when we are talking CB lingo with truckers along the way.I chose the Midland 75822 for its small size and ease of use and also because of all the positive reviews it has received.  I havent been disappointed at all it does everything I want it to do.I did get the external antenna which gives it all the power I need. I have small hands and I love it because it is an ultraminiature with the pushtotalk button on the side.  The unit is very convenient. reliable and great fun to use.  Oh yes. and one other thing. the batteries last forever or so it seems.,5,1,767
ALO7PEIIIGXA9,33,I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders. and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaverweight cable that worked fine.  I plan to try it with a canon camcorder. but I suspect it will work no better. Ill probably end up returning them.,1,0,406

ALPWD1TL9U7KF,10,Got this to give for a christmas present. After opening up the packing box. the box that the camera was in was dented in and had razor cuts on the outside of the box. Went to put film and batteries in and noticed that Red Flash light stayed on at all times. The flash fired at all times and would not shut off. DEFECTIVE Camera. Called the company MTA Trading. and they said it was defective and to send it back. I told them to just Credit back the money. I did not want another camera.They gave me the RA and I sent it back. Now. I get a notification that they recieved the camera back and they are sending me another camera via UPS!! When I returned the camera I even put a letter in the box stating I Did NOT want another camera and to please just credit the amount back. Now I have a UPS notification that a package is on the way. This is not what I stated or what we had agreed on!! I am very Unhappy at this point. to say the least! MTA trading does not seem to communicate or keep their word!!I just want my money back .as stated by phone and letter. for the defective camera..Have ordered many times from Amazon and never had a problem until now.,1,0,1154

ALR7JXNK1KOIC,22,Just received this lock. First impressions are good. the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product. The key is big and easy to locate. The ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched .not really a concern on *this* laptop..I can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device. There is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off. Things that I am thinking of now are specific to my laptop. The Kensington slot is right by my system fan. which I have a laptop that blows out 1000 degree air. The metal lock gets very hot. Perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thieves.Its no secret that cable can be cut. the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch it.,5,1,815

ALSM8MHQ1U504,0,I just bought this camera based on the reviews here. I cant add much to the reviews above .The image quality and features on this thing are top notch. but I did want to let prospective buyers know that Olympus is now  offering the camera with 4 NiMH batteries and a quick charger included.  Nice to know the company takes consumer feedback seriously!,5,1,350
ALTAGRQ1G7G6F,5355,This is one of six Aiwa products I own.  I have had it for almost 2 years .since it came out in 1998..  As for the CD player... never had any real problems.  Once. the lens was dirty and just needed cleaning. most likely  because I really dont take the best care of my stuff.  Other things to  mention. As far as picking a stereo with the best overall quality. price.  power. and amount of features  this system is your best choice.,5,1,432
ALU1FK38NDX7Q,33,As an avid reader. I find the Nook a wonderful wealth of reading material.  I learn something about the Nook each time I read and hit the wrong spot ... which is good because it gives me more info.  I do wish that the book information when purchasing would include the number of pages in the book.  I just bought one with a measly 26 pages!  I have had some difficulty with getting my Nook friends releasing their books to borrow. The borrowlend process is a tad challenging.  Overall. its a wonderful product.,4,1,510
ALUNVOQRXOZIA,11,Useful. versatile. lightweight. and convenient.This small lightweight cable is easy to travel with.  Use it to sync your laptop or connect to any  other serial device.I bought it to use as a second hot sync cable to  help keep by home computer and work computer synced.  The full sized cradle  is more expensive and less versatile.You can use it to turn your Palm  into a terminal. via a modem or direct connection.  Note. you may need a  null modem adapter for some devices.For programmers. I think this cable  is fabulous. It makes the Palm useful as a programming interface for any  serial device.The low cost of a Palm and cable means any small serial  interface device. like a voicemail system. can have a permanent or  temporary display hooked up without adding a lot of expensive hardware. or  hauling around a heavy laptop.I think this concept will increase the  need for Palm programmers and generate a new breed of Palm based  application interfaces with associated software.Buy it if you need a  method to sync to a laptop when travelling. or for an interface for a  serial device.,5,1,1092
ALUNVOQRXOZIA,2324,.If you have a Palm V or Vx this is the case to get.The Vx is a  classy looking Palm. The case makes the Vx into a Porche.  The combination  of the two is terrific performance and looks.There is one problem  with turning the power but a software hack fixes this.A great gift  idea for an intelligent businessman or woman.  The more you use these t  devices the more you will come to depend on them.If you want to use  this as a wallet. it is a good option.  I like to keep my wallet trimmed  down without a lot of junk.  This is not a real wallet so you cant  accumulate junk in here.The Palm Vx complements this in that you can  quickly enter whatever receipt information you might normally accumulate in  your walletauto records. expenses. etc.  And toss those out or if you want  to keep them dump in a monthly file folder.I strongly recommend the  combination of this wallet and the Vx.,5,1,890
ALUNVOQRXOZIA,1418,I have a couple of these.  It makes it easy to sync between multiple computers.Unfortunately. I now need to upgrade my conduit software to get it to work with MS Office 2003.  The cost of the software is more than I paid for my last PALM III.  Im not one to pay for something twice. so Ill be tossing this PDA out or giving it away.If you are thinking about getting one of these. my advice is dont unless you are running legacy software and plan not to upgrade.,4,1,461

ALV8O7L6MICPC,0,I purchased this camcorder shortly before our baby was born. and absolutely love it.  Its a bit expensive. but so easy to use and handy that it was easily worth it for us.  I used the accompanying software to  capture the best frames as still photos. and then simply chose the  u0026quotsave as HTML albumu0026quot. and VOILAI had a web site for the baby!  There are plenty of more advanced features that I havent had the time to  experiment with yet. but its good to know that theyre there when I do get  around to it.  I couldnt be happier with my choice!,5,1,557

ALWH3G8IV7P4P,0,Ive had mine for 3 weeks... and its tough to decide whether to turn it back in for a Palm IIIHandspring Visor Deluxe.Cost. Hands down. its Amazons Nino 319 package USD180 for a 4 gray level. 8MB. WinCE 2.x. WITH  19.s modem!!! And it supports voice recordings.A visor deluxe .USD250.  with 8MB module .USD40. and a modem .USD130. runs more than twice the nino.  yes the modem is a 33.6. but for emails. who cares?  Its not like youre  going to be downloading a Quake IV demo on a handheld...Form factor.  slight edge to Palm III.  Palm III is slightly shorter and a ounce lighter.  the real difference is the width  when held in a hand its not just the  width you are concerned about. its the width on both sides.  the nino ends  up feeling much bigger  those with big hands will probably like it.The buttons on the sides of the Nino are damned annoying.  Sorry Philips  .and Amazon. but the buttons really belong on the face.  Although I would  like the voice startstop button on the upper righthand corner of the  side. like a pocket recorder.Screen. even.  Palms 160x160 is too  granular.  Ninos resolution is very satisfactory. but the handrecognition  area is WAY too big  i wish you could select an option to reduce it to  66%.  Palms 16 shades of gray outpaces the ninos 4. but Im having a  difficult time noticing it.Software. mixed.  Palm OS has more 3rd party  software than WinCE. but the quality programs are few for both platforms.  Outlook is better on the WinCE especially with Office 2000.  But palms PIM  is somewhat easier to use.Softwaredata loading. MSs 3rd version of  their softwaredata loader gets the nod here.  Doesnt come with the Nino  package. but its easy enough to find and download.  No real complaints  about either one.Handwriting.  slight edge to NinoWinCE.  I started on  the Palm III and it drove me nuts trying to switch over to the Nino   simply because of the weird way you write with Palms system.  WinCE does  support a more natural way to write. but i still dislike their  u0026quotiu0026quot form.  The autoword fill is something Im trying to get used  to on the Nino. and I like it.  Palm mised the boat big time for not  supporting cut. copy. and paste features  whats up with THAT?!  a sw  program is available to fix that.Theres more comparisons I can make.  but I think it boils down to this. If you need voice and modem capability  on a palmsized PC for less than USD250. select Amazons USD180 Nino 319  package. If you just use it for PIM and PC syncing .the USD200 option. OR you  have USD400 to spend for voice and modem capability on a palmsized PIM  machine. go handspring.  Of course. USD400 also gets you into the Cassiopeia  E105  but thats another review.Either way you go. accept the  limitations of the machine you buy.Amazon.  what a great deal on this  product  many THANKS!  Very nice support. BTW.,4,1,2861
ALYX4LDWJLIRQ,2324,Nice solid radio. Reception was great in every room but the one I needed it for. Was disappointed when the reception in the graniteenclosed shower of the onewindow bath did not equal that of its 3year old USD7 oddlot predecessor. This may not be the best radio for close quarters. but was worth a try. The search continues.,3,0,323
ALZ4203RNAJ2T,0,Bought these at a great price u0026 thought that high grade meant excellent quality. Not so! Almost half of the tapes do not work properly and had to be thrown away. Wont be buying Maxell again. Very disappointed.,3,0,213

AM178A0W4L6TT,523,I used this to mount my 27 inch Samsung in my bedroom. It feels very sturdy and I do not expect any problems with sagging or falling with it. For the price this mount is excellent. Why pay more for something that you will not see and does the same job as other high priced mounts. The only thing I did not like was the way the instructions have you mount the TV after the bracket is attached to the wall but like another reviewer stated. I removed the head from the arm. attached it to the TV and then reattached the head to the arm and slid the bolt that I removed back in. I did reverse the orientation of the bolt by having it drop in instead of pushing it in from the bottom. It made it much easier. After 15 years of having a TV on the edge of my dresser I finally freed that space up and have my TV mounted on the wall and I am very happy with this purchase.,4,1,864
AM2PAP6COUV5J,11,Works Great for the Brother Personal Labeler Machine. White .PT90.! Just like the original one that came with the labeler and great replacement,5,0,143
AM34M3FP9VLAH,44,Its a good product. but not for the USD20 they want for it. For an earbud with that price. it should at least offer vox as well as PTT. and the earbud isnt good for outdoor use. because the earbud comes out easily. Overall. its a device good for indoor or low activity use. but if you dont absolutely need this one. go for the other models.,3,0,340
AM3R8PW5WQ7UB,0,At this price its probably a knock off but it shows 100M across so I dont care.  I guess the snagless clips are pretty nice too.,4,1,128

AM583EZIQ9YO5,0,The price seems to reflect the product here unfortunately. I bought this to be used during a short film production. It worked about 60% of the time. It would either drop out or give a distorted image to the monitor. Havent tested on other monitor as we were to busy working. but this cable negatively affected my production having to wait to start rolling as we didnt have an image.I will like be returning this product. You get what you pay for.,2,0,446
AM5ONRMISKR3W,1,I bought a Nook for myself and love it.I love the ease of getting booksthough my credit card payment is going up! I also love how easy it is for me to read with an increased font size and a change of font. I dont have to find my reading glasses to read on the Nook.But it turned out to be a hit for child with Dyslexia who was a reluctant reader. Child was supposed to read 20 minutes a night. After 10 minutes she would be asking if the 20 minutes was up.I downloaded a free Rick Riordan novel to let her try the Nook .with lage print settings.and she loved it. His books are about the 4th grade reading level. from 4.0 to 4.4. She was only reading mid third grade until reading on the Nook. She would beg to read on my Nook. I got her her own and she is on her 4th Rick Riordan book. She saw the same book she was reading in a book store and told me she would never have been able to read it in paperback form. that the print was too small and too many words on each page.,5,1,974
AM64W98FUVRG1,22,it is use less I order it because the mic does not work when I connect it the speaker does not work,1,0,99
AM6HS4KPCC3TV,0,I purchased this because I keep buying scrabble dictionaries and word building books for the family to use while playing.  This works great and cuts out a lot of fishing from some of our players.,5,0,195

AM9DX7OBS33U4,23,The product worked as advertised. I used in in a car 6disc CD changer module and CDs that were no longer playing or that were skipping played fine after cleaning.,4,0,162
AM9ILQ6YXQ2XC,11,My chief disappointment with this unit was that there is no volume control on the 5.1 analog outs.  This forced me to buy an outboard decoder instead of being able to connect the player directly to my power amp. As some other  reviewers have noted. this unit has a problem with sync. although I have  heard that newer firmware will fix it.Other than the above the unit  seems solid and the feature set was great. The improvement over VHS was  amazing!,3,0,451
AM9OC1FTXJICQ,88,Needed a drive for some of my photos that are still on disk.  This one was cheap. but very difficult to eject the disk.  Not satisfied with this at all.,2,0,152
AMAR6CIOZUQO4,0,Im using this to mount an older SyncMaster 191T above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price.  Installation was simple. though I used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment. as none of those included would work with my monitor.  The tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle.  I would have preferred another 1015 degrees of vertical tilting capability. but what is available will be fine for most applications.  I posted a couple of photos that shows it mounted.Overall Im very pleased with the purchase and would buy again should I need to mount another small display.,4,1,681
AMCAQVNCVI811,34,I work a side job directing traffic near a busy Texas highway.  Without this. I had a hard time hearing the other officers on my Talkabout.  Using the earbud makes things MUCH easier and I can concentrate on the cars and not the radio.The earbud is a little large...I have to reposition it every now and then and the distance from the earbud to the microphone is too long.  I run the cord behind my neck to solve this.  All in all. this was a good investment.,4,1,459
AMCV0H3C7VCJO,0,First of all. voodoo3 products .all models. are both 2d and 3d cards. 2d is for stuff like displaying windows and your desktop and stuff like that. You notice 2d performance when youre scrolling down a window and the  scroll bar is moving in blocks instead of smoothly like it should. Also. 2d  is used in games that rely on your computer to make frames or pictures.  Quake is an example of a game that uses 2d mode. The v33k is excelent in  this area. although game performance is highly dependant on your processor  speed in 2d. 3d is used in games .e.g. quake2. quake3. unreal tournament..  If a game says u0026quotopenGLu0026quot u0026quotDirect3Du0026quot or u0026quotglideu0026quot  on the side of the box. it uses 3d and will work with v3s. You notice 3d  performance when your games dont move smoothly. If a windmill on the  screen moves like a clock ticking. thats bad. If it moves smoothly. thats  good. The v33k is currenly the best 3d card on the market. I say best  because even though theres a v33500 thats definitely faster. sometime in  2000 3dfx is going to come out with voodoo4s which will dwarf the  voodoo3s in performance and support 32 bit color. According to amazon.com  review guidelines. Im not supposed to mention prices here. but let me tell  you. theyre gonna be cheap! ..,4,1,1301
AMD4FC5M30SNV,3337,I travel on transatlantic flights a a lot.  I watch a lot of TV at home.  It is time to change  i want to read like good old times before college.  So the purpose of an eready was ONLY for reading.  I spent a lot of time reading. comparing .online and in stores. this nook. to other versions of nook and to kindle.  Here is why I chose this nook .wifi only..1. I can use public books without a lot of conversion.  Nook is not nearly as restrictive as Kindle.2. I dont need the 3G .which works in the US only..  I plan what I want to read or I download many books. so I have many good choices if I want to read already in the ereader.3. Wifi can be connected to WEP secured network.  I bought two nooks .one for myself. one for my wife.. both connected to the secured wifi on the first try.  I read that Kindle cannot connect to a secured network and unsecuring a netwrok is a major pain.4. Nook connects via USB to my computer.  You can just donwload the books .epub format. directly into Nook. without stupid programs or interfaces .just like copying from one folder to another in USB flash drive..  I discovered that I dont even need WIFI  really....5. Nook Color is an LCD screen.  I make enough money to buy an ipad if I needed an LCD screen.  I can easily read from my laptop... if i wanted an LCD screen.6. Nook allows to read .easily. texts in foreign languages .not in latin alphabet. and I was planning to read primarily books in foreign language.  as easy as 123   but i tried epub format only.7. bestbuy had a promotion for the nook plus a cover of your choice .i got one with a light. for USD150...8. USB charger and USB cable .to connect to computer. is the same as my blackbarrys cord.  This is music to a travellers ears.Really. this nook is a nobrainer... over other nooks or kindle. if you want to read.,5,1,1820
AMDB1P0KZJKNF,55,Although weve only had it for about a month. my wife and I seem to become happier with it every day. Because its so conducive to reading. we seem to find more opportunities to read. Because my wife and I have some eyesight problems. the six different font sizes is an especially useful feature. The only reason I didnt give it five stars is that on one occaision it became a little quirky about recogning new content. the problem was quickly resolved by calling 1800THEBOOK. We are very happy with it.,4,1,501
AMFA4MKQ0JXXC,44,This cable lock is long enough. the cable is covered as to not scrape things. and the key is simple and effective. I had trouble the first few times trying to open it in the HP Pavillion. but it seemed it must have been the notebook. as the lock worked fine outside the computer. It works great. now. and at a really good price .compared to lesser locks even..,4,1,360
AMFU8V7WZHOWM,22,Fits my new Kindle nicely. I like the Velcro tuck in tabs that hold it securely.  The onoff and volume switch are easily accessible. I really like the hand strap on the cover. makes it much easier to hold and read. The price was right to make it a great value.I was very glad to find it. since there are so many different types of Kindles and each requires a different cover.The purple color is nice too!,4,1,404
AMFXT0836BF87,0,Its a good cable.  The only thing I would change on it is to make the snagless attachment more like what is on the Cables to Go 27150.  Its just a better design. but this one still does the job.,4,1,194

AML8NIWFKHZJU,0,The TV would not stay level on mine.  Turned out to have two problems.  First  the slot in the little bracket that the bigger TV bracket hangs onto was a bit too high so the little bolt was resting on the slots bottom edge.  I drilled it out to be 116 of an inch lower and that solved the problem.  I also put a lock washer on the bolt between the two plates. Second  the top bolt hole in the single arm was not in the center.  I drilled it much larger so the bolt going through the bottom hole could be straight up and down which fixed that problem.  .When the bolt was tightened it automatically became perpendicular to the bottom hole..  These problems show insufficient quality control and should not happen. I therefore recommend you try another brand.,3,0,757
AMLFNXUIEMN4T,1,I was real psyched when i got it and all the features are what i was looking for in a truck gps. Well that all went away real quick.1.The log feature and milage is inaccurate.2.The speed limits are way off all throughout the country.3.The screen is hard to read on sunny days.4 The  suction cup mount is clunky and comes loose constantly.5.It sent me over ebbers pass while trucking to Lake Tahoe last week.  .14% grade for 15 miles. I wont do that again.6. The power switch has recessed into the unit and will not turn back on.7.Called tech support about returning the unit and the guy barely spoke english.8.I expected better from rand mcnally.,1,0,646

AMMLX7EUOD4D2,11,This case is great for value and for space..for the most part. Its actually really hard to find a good value leather case for a 15.4 notebook. but this was it. Unfortunately though not much room for any other types of peripheral. ie notebook mouse. once my adaptor and power cord went in. as nothing else but my notebook fits in that compartment so they had to go in another. but all in all. really nice case. and not too heavy being leather either. Another good point ladies is that its looks are relatively unisex. not too masculine but not too feminine either. Highly recommended.,4,1,583
AMP3SRCVG8VED,77,After going to Bu0026N to pick up a charger and seeing the large price tag I found this charger. Works great!! Havent had any problems!,5,0,135
AMPDIR560NXE7,0,The PC software used for programming the remote is very easy to use and a nice surprise coming from the kings of bad user interface designMicrosoft.  You will have no trouble setting it up nor will it be difficult to modify the setup at a later date.  Unfortunately. the remote itself eats batteries .I use NiMH rechargeables. but they still only last a month or so. and the touch screen is balky .it has trouble accurately sensing pressure at the edges in particular..  You can do anything with this remote. but its just not the panacea I had hoped for.  I would not recommend it. nor would I condemn anyone for buying it.  If you have very. very complicated home theater needs. it will certainly be able to meet them.,3,0,719
AMQJ1W1JRBMHT,23,I too was thrown off by the placement of the insert key. but as another reviewer said. that only took about a week .OK. so Im slower than that other guy. to get use to.  Other than that. Im really happy with it.  As  for the small buttons. that concerned me at first. but Ive found it  comfortable to use them and I appreciate the small keyboard size that they  allow.I hate the fact that many upscale keyboards come with custom  buttons .e.g. speaker volume. cd player buttons. that only work easily with  Windows.  The Natural Pro is guilty of this. but hey. MS makes these things  anyhow.  At least with the Elite. the only worthless key is the ubiquitous  Windows key.,4,1,672
AMRW6UFX1EBRP,11,I havent had a chance to use the camera yet  it just arrived in the Christmas Eve mail. I opened the box. Everything was looking good. I played with the camera.

Hasnt anyone  at Polaroid heard of Steve Jobs? Will update my review after I find out if  the software fix works. Keep your fingers crossed.,1,0,492
AMSASGGMYEZYM,1018,I have had this bag for about two months.  Overall the bag seems oganized and well made. except the most important part of a bag. the zippers.  They CONSTANTLY jam and jump off track.  I have made several trips using this bag. and have had problems every single time.  A huge pain when going through airport screening.I bought this bag above someothers simply because I thought the Samsonite brand would guarantee some measure of quality. but. like many companies. I see they too have chosen quick profits over a good reputation.Avoid this bag at all costs!,1,0,557

Tablet seems a little flimsy too.  But the great screen. lightweight usability and the option to add a 64 gig micro sd card outweigh the shortcomings.,4,1,505
AMVRYALJB1ZQH,23,The Grundig G2000A is made of solid plastic thats lightweight and durable. At about 1.5 pounds. this little .but powerful. radio is easy to transport .A leather carrying case is included as are two excellent ear  pieces..The Grundig G2000A is powered by three AA batteries that seem to  last a long time.  There are two digital clocks built in  set one to your  home time and the second to your travel destination. A handy wake up alarm  feature and a small .1.5 inch. speaker.  The speaker is a testament to the  fine German quality we have come to expect from Grundig.I did have a  difficult time picking up remote world channels. but I easily found several  new stations to listen to. I had to remind myself that this was a portable  radio and I couldnt expect the same power performance from this model as I  do with my Grundig 960.Overall this is a quality piece of craftsmanship  and electronics. It is sturdy. dependable and easy to carry  it is worth  the price charged.,5,1,978

AN1GEJSF068EW,11,I have to say that I had some doubts in buying this MD due to the fact  that through the internet you can find some guys with some problems. But  lets say that theyre 1 in a billion. I received this product in Chile  .southamerica. and the first time I used it. was for what I bought it for.  to play background tracks with amplification in a church. The sound was a  supreme earcherish.I work with a group of young people who share the  love of Jesus using the music. The Sharp even has been used to play the  backgrounds when we go to visit a person in a hospital. with a little  portable stereo. it makes miracles!I strongly recomend this device.

AN30G4IKL1BMZ,3437,I thought this item was the savior of my extensive SmartMedia use.  I thought this Floppy Adapter could be used on *any* computer. but you need to install the drivers for this Flashpath adapter first.  That is the part that majorly .wasnt good..  Also. you cant install the Flashpath Adapter drivers on a computer that has more than one CPU.I have a computer at home that is a dualprocessor system. but I could not install the drivers on my machine!But despite the driver incompatibility. the flashpath adapter had a quick transfer rate. that is. versus a serial communication download.Great item for on the go between work and home. when downloading smartmedia files to your computer.,4,1,685
AN30G4IKL1BMZ,1414,I was wondering why the radio would go into a weird locked mode in which you could no longer use it.  I had to shut the radio off. then turn it back on again.  Just a slight movement from the male plug .that goes into the radio.. would cause the radio to be unusable.I found out the male plug was not inserted all the way into the radios headset socket.  The problem is the rubber molding around the male plug was too much. not allowing a good  seat .  I used an Xacto knife and cut away at the rubber molding. thus allowing a good  seat  of the male plug.  No more weird locking of the radio anymore.  I also had to do this with the other Motorola headsets that came with my Motorola Radios as well.,2,0,700

The size of the bag is small enough to fit in my travel bag. but yet. has a lot of storage space for all the necessities of a digital camera.I highly recommend for a small digital camera like my Toshiba PDRM1.

AN49O6YZAW4VS,0,Ok. I just got 4 of these 2 way radios for my frineds and I. THEY ARE GRGEAT!  We have used them a lot considering we just got them. We plan to use them ALL SUMMER VACATION!  .WOOHOO 4 summer.But if your are looking for  a great pair of radios GET THESE! Because they arent as pricy as  u0026quotothersu0026quot on the market. All in all these are a great pair of 2  way radios!@!,5,1,380
AN4ALUMJTDX3Z,45,This is a nice case.  Bought it for my dads M515 and out of the box it didnt fit because the stylus insert is too large for the accessory slide but he was able to modify the case so that it does fit.  He likes it!,4,1,213
AN4PBPHH9PFKS,0,Very nice tablet for 100 bucks. Great display. Plays games and videos great. The only down fall is that you can save you apps on the SD card. Overall great tablet.,4,1,163
AN560AP1HH0U1,0,This computer lock works great with my laptop. The key takes some trial and error to be turned correctly but it all works out in the end.,4,1,137
AN57T6XT0WL12,1,I bought this item for my mom she really needed it. she liked it. its great since then she doesnt bug me. Lol,4,1,109
AN5YEFFCJ19PH,1,I just bought the Garmin GPS 12 after doing loads of research. including reading the reviews posted here. and as I first time buyer I was uncertain. but Im a believer now!  I wondered what motivated people to sit down and write these reviews...it seemed sort of suspicious to me.I fully understand now. and I hope to contribute as a way of saying thanks to the other reviewers.This unit is outstanding. as the other reviews state. and I found it particularly wonderful when combined with some free software called GPSU or GPS utility.  You can find it on the net .they are out of England..  You can downloadupload waypoints and make a map.  Combination of these two are a must for the beginner to intermediate GPS user who camps. fishes. bikes. or visits places that they know theyll forget how to return to.  Just click u0026quotGOTOu0026quot and then highlight your waypoint and you can leave your brain at home.  Ive also found that using 4 energizer u0026quotAAu0026quot batteries gives MUCH more than 24 hours of use more like 32 hours.  Very. very impressed with this device.,5,1,1081
AN64MG0PEGE8X,2121,The original Nook was an android tablet in a wheelchair and the Hd has moved closer to being an open machine so it is on crutches  now.  Many but not all apps from Google Play now can be installed. Not all  work that they do allow to be installed work either.  All part of controlling their profit stream. The fact that it can also be a Kindle is a major plus!  Check into the N2A card to get it closer to a regular open tablet without rooting or voiding the guarantee.,4,1,469
AN6S3ZHX8OVGP,0,This Item .Grundig YB 400PE  Yacht Boy 400PE. AMFMSW Radio. is priced .USD. more than if I order it straight from Grundig.,4,0,122
AN74FSBOYHAJS,918,I have a lot of higher end audio gear and expect a lot from my stuff but this thing has exceeded what I expected.  I also purchased sonic mics and I recorded a band .w permission. at a show. and the shound is almost better  than some live albums Ive heard.  One thing is that the input amp has two  settings and as you increase the record gain it switches between the two  and this causes a miss. but a minor problem.I also recorded some CDs  for a trip I took and this thing had more battery power than I had patience  to listen to it. and the sound was wonderful.  Even the bass boost thing  which I expected to be trash works super fine.I wish the remote had  recording features but besides that. Im very happy.Every sony Ive ever  had broke. including DSS dishes. CDs. Car stereos. Video cams. etc.  Just  say No to Sony junk.S,5,1,831
AN7S71E53Q2CZ,1718,first time the totally wrong product came in.  after reordering with customer service. the second set of 2 came in.  it looks nothing like these. the fit is wrong and color is ugly gray.  totally disappointed.  amazon customer service was great tho!  really bummed out because I loved the style and color.  thought this would work great as my ear canals very tiny...bummed out.,2,0,377
AN92U23LYTQBR,0,These are really nice tapes. they record well the first time and rerecord over and over. Still have a vcr to record tv occasionally and these work well,4,1,151
AN963YBBLSZ23,0,At first I liked the unit very much.  But about four months down the road I purchased a disc called u0026quotRasor Blade Smmileu0026quot. I locked the player. the all elctronic functions ceased to exsist. and had to be  unplugged to retrieve the disc.  After this about 50% of all other discs I  put in the unit did exactly the same thing rendering the unit so wildly  inconsistant that the unit became useless.  .Note. these other discs had  played fine before the u0026quotlockingu0026quot incident..  This happened after  the first three months making it less expensive replace the unit .with a  much more dependable. if less glitzy.Toshiba unit..  Also. the jog shuttle  NEVER functioned correctly.,1,0,702
AN9TLUKFAJHP8,1317,I absolutely love my Palm IIIx.  Originally. my wife ordered a Handspring Visor for my birthday.  Six weeks later. with no indication of when .if ever. the Visor would be shipping. she cancelled it and ordered the Palm  IIIx for me instead.  Ive been playing endless with it since.I find.  for example. its easier to write on the PDA than on paper in a moving car  hence. car rides can be much more productive.Then I found out about  downloading games from the Internet.  Ive been wasting endless amounts of  time playing a beloved game from my college days .u0026quotRogueu0026quot..,5,1,584
ANANVXGOAPKX3,3245,I read all of the reviews. and then bought the 340R.  Works great.  Before the 340R. I would scan photos. and then have to color correct. but with the 340R. the colors look natural right from the camera.  The hires photos are  fantastic  now I need to buy a printer.,4,1,266
ANBDRW2S3OX7J,0,The NOOK Color is a very good eReader. however. customer support .from Barnes and Noble. NOT Amazon. is seriously lacking. The chargers are just awful. I went through three .in less than a year. before giving up on my Nook. The connector becomes loose easily. and it is possible to lose the small metal component inside your Nook. Also. once the warranty is up .1 year.. you have to buy a new charger .USD20..,2,0,409
ANBVYPS344ADM,0,I bought the camera about 3 months ago and everything was great.  I previously owned a Nikon SLR and had no doubt this was going to be a quality product.  The 880 was too small for my husbands big hands and the 990 was little more camera than we needed.Unfortunately after two months of use. all the photos taken in automatic mode were underexposed.  I called Nikon tech support and they walked me through a couple of things to try but nothing worked.  I found the tech support people to be undertrained and I knew more about the camera than some of them .pretty bad considering you drill down to the specific u0026quotCoolpix 950 supportu0026quot through the automated phone menu..  One support person blamed the 64MB Viking compact flash card on my problems. saying they only support Lexar .brand that comes with the camera. or SanDisk. and that Viking u0026quotis known to cause problemsu0026quot with the Coolpix 950!  I have read many reviews and never heard of this problem!  I called Viking and they had no knowledge of any incompatability with the 950.  Eventually Nikon replaced the strobe light under warranty but its still got the same underexposure problem.  To their credit. Nikon paid for my camera to be returned to them for a second time.  I am waiting to receive my camera back.I still like Nikon unfortunately all the hospital pictures when I gave birth to my son are now sitting on my hard drive and every photo is underexposed.,4,1,1447
ANC01T5KX4GK9,22,This part is not compatible with the Garmin 1300.  It doesnt work and wish I could return it for a refund.,1,0,106
ANCPZEDZNPNEO,22,Does a good job of cleaning heads and improving picture quality. Cant tell when the end of the cleaning tape is reached and should be rewound.,4,1,142
AND4MIETBW9TL,0,I bought the moleskine Kindle dx cover as a gift for my boyfriend. He was really excited about it and it looks really good. If you care more about form over function then I would highly recommend this product. The only downside to the cover is that it makes the kindle. which ways nothing. really heavy. which is kind of a pain.In all Im really happy with my purchase.,4,1,368
AND5PHNUNNYOR,0,These speakers are a very good value. Speakers this good by other brands cost USD100.00 and up! They work well on portable cd players. walkmans. desktops. laptops. palmtops. and more.,5,0,183
AND5PHNUNNYOR,23,I have a total of 5 computer systems. pentium 100. pentium 233. pentium II 300. amd 400 mhz. pentium 166. I tried this modem on all systems and it did not work. I have been working with computers for over 10 years. I tried to bring the modem back to the store but they said i coundent becaused it was  opened!,1,0,309
ANDFQ67GG170I,23,there are not that many apps ant it is allays freezing up to the point of having to turn it off,1,0,95
ANDTUKS3MPAJB,1,I have an impression Ive got a lemon unit. It works ok for a while and then it stop responding deliberately to some touchpush buttons. You have to shut it down and start again. I have 2 more of this readers. no problems at all.,1,0,227
ANG5QMOD9L72L,58,This is the second radio of this model that Ive owned. both adapted to and mounted on a motorcycle for BiketoBike communication.  When matched to a quality antenna. the range is better than I expected. perhaps as much as several miles.  This is quite adequate for my needs.  The ability to adapt the unit to the motorcycles intercom system was a critical factor in my selection and this radio is easily adapted using the headset ports.  The first radio got soaked in a rainstorm and quit working until I opened it up and dried it out. then all was well again and the radio still works fine. I just have to put a bag over it for protection from the weather I guess.  The second radio is mounted on my new bike and I expect similar performance.  I like the ability to convert it to a handheld as well but havent had the opportunity to really use that feature much.,4,1,862
ANGES9XEYEAJ2,11,This was my first shortwave radio and it continues to perform wonderfully.  Easy to connect an external antenna for even greater reception.  Youll love all the little extras such as numeric keypad. SSB. 40 channel memory.  and that convenient little light for bedside listening.  Ive taken this  radio all over the place and it never lets me down.  Highly recommended!,5,1,368
ANHSCGFJV59C8,6167,I have had my 950 for 9 months now and couldnt be without it. Its great. the manual isnt so hot but you can print a good one from the Nikon CD which comes with the camera. When you buy the camera get a card reader that  plugs into the USB port. It is really fast. I save my images on Zip disks  and use PhotoSuite III to adjust most of them. Adobe Photo Shop 5.5 is used  on the very important ones. This camera is teriffic and the price has  really come down in 9 months. By the way get as large a memory card as you  can afford because you will be taking many more pictures with this camera  than you ever did with a film camera. I cant recommend it highly enough.,5,1,666
ANIH8ABMIHO9U,6364,Didnt work and not worth sending back  Id spend more money on postage.  Got one that worked through Best Buy.,1,0,109
ANJ2TSWGXWZ0,68,I owned the DVD player for almost one year and have had multiple DVDs not perform. Disneys u0026quotThe Kidu0026quot will shut down the DVD player after the FBI screen. Disneys u0026quotDinosauru0026quot will skip chunks of movie. an 1 hour and 23 minute movie ended up being only 45 mins. because of all the skipping. I called RCA and they also stated consumers had problems with u0026quotScary Movieu0026quot and others. RCA blames that DVD manufactures are not following guidelines but all movies mentioned play fine on my JVC DVD player. It took a year to find problems on the RCA DVD player. these films were new releases and if the trend follows. soon it could be more DVDs that wont play. My suggestion is dont buy it.,3,0,725
ANJUFOF9IZHEV,11,If youre thinking that this picture looks like the GOOD. OLD version of the Maxell VP100 video head cleaner. youre right. it does.  The Product Features also describe the features of the OLD version  such as speaker check. onscreen instructions. etc.  Unfortunately. what the seller actually shipped was the NEW. inferior version of Maxell VP100.  Which was exactly what I was trying NOT to purchase. having read many. many extremely negative reviews thereof.So curb that elation you were feeling at apparently having found some rare OLD Maxells for sale. and dont be misled like I was.,1,0,586
ANK9O4DUKCIH2,11,It was so so so sensitive to line voltage that it would shutdown and alarm when it wasnt necessary... on a couple occassions waking me up in the middle of the night.Eventually it failed to the point where it just randomly shutdown my computer.,1,0,243
ANLAG5XW3CO4M,0,Didnt last as long as the original cable. which it was supposed to replace.  MiniUSB broke within a week of use.,1,0,112
ANLNOQJSKANWM,55,A combination of two of my favorite things. Moleskine u0026 Kindle. The analog interface .. is very practical .i mean the notebook.!,5,0,132
ANLRDIKW6TY5L,0,The Nook Color is a great option for a resonably priced Android tablet. It was real easy to root and turn into a versatile tool.  The Nook color doesnt have a camera but more than makes up for it with the screen.,5,1,212
ANLTHUP7BM3QC,55,I had an ipad. hated it. always froze up.  I had a sony and wasnt so happy.  I took a chance buying this item from Barnes n Nobles for USD249.the regular price for the nook color. and to my surprise...its a PC. Reader. MP3 Player. I can watch movies online. save all types of files for viewing later...it does it all and never freezes up on me.  B u0026 Nobles even offers a full warranty if you drop it. spill water on it or anything at all your fault or accident..take it in and they replace it with a new one no questions asked. for an extra USD54.  I LOVE THIS ITEM!!!  I bought another for my daughter and my husband for Christmas.,5,1,636
ANO1VPEY9QNTZ,22,I have a great pair of Sennheiser RS 120 as my main headphones.  These replaced another very good pair of Advents.  Well I thought I would like a second set for the famly room so I went shopping on Amazon.  I found the JVC HAW300RF at list price for USD129.99 on sale for USD39.94.  The price was excellent and Amazon had them at my house in a few days.  Im not an audio expert but I do enjoy watching TV and listening to good music with headphones.  I couldnt do ether with these JVCs.  I tried everything to eliminate the hissing.  I tried every adjustment it has to offer. I moved to different parts of the room and to  different parts of the house.  Even at USD39.94 these were not worth keeping.  They went back to Amazon for full refund.  I know what I have in the Sennheiser RS 120 and I will wait for Amazons next sale.,1,0,827
ANOPNOJSVI4PH,88,Although this Nook was a refurbished unit. one would never guess it. It performs as a new and unused device. It has everything loaded in it and was fairly easy to set up. Bu0026N store folks are willing and able to help if need be.,4,1,231
ANOPXA9AUMS82,0,I have used Maxell tapes for 30+ years so I was surprised at the exceptionally poor quality of these tapes.  The 8hour tapes are equally as bad as these 6hour ones.  They are now made in Korea instead of formerly in Canada and that might have something to do with the serious decline in quality. After 14 uses the picture rolls on the screen and cannot be resolved with tracking controls. there are severe dropouts and the tape mechanism makes so much noise that I honestly thought that my VCR was destroyed and I would have to buy a new one. I checked some of my other new Maxell tapes and most of them had the same results. I tried a TDK tape and was relieved to find that my VCR was still functioning perfectly so I threw out all of my new Maxells and am now using TDK and Sony tapes. which work just fine. I am so disappointed in Maxell but I guess they dont care about VHS tape quality anymore.,1,0,899
ANOPXA9AUMS82,0,I have used Maxell tapes for 30+ years so I was surprised at the exceptionally poor quality of these tapes. They are now made in Korea instead of formerly in Canada so be wary of old reviewers that give these tapes high praise.  They are probably reviewing the discontinued Canadian version. which I too loved. The change in production country might have something to do with the serious decline in quality. After 14 uses the picture rolls on the screen and cannot be resolved with tracking controls. there are severe dropouts and the tape mechanism makes so much noise that I honestly thought that my VCR was destroyed and I would have to buy a new one. I checked some of my other new Maxell tapes .only used a few times. and most of them had the same results. I tried a TDK tape and was relieved to find that my VCR was still functioning perfectly so I threw out all of my new Maxells and am now using TDK and Sony tapes. which work just fine. I am so disappointed in Maxell but I guess they dont care about VHS tape quality anymore.,1,0,1035
ANP2HRJGC0Z43,0,This was a good functional power strip. It could be a bit thinner to fit under furniture better. but really it has been very reliable and easy to use. The colorful sockets are a nice touch as well.,4,1,197
ANPHRGMB4LI3B,0,I ordered it on Oct 27.2010  assuming that theyd have replacement notepads to fill it. They STILL dont 6.5 months later. Its pretty useless without refill note pads! Also it does NOT fit the iPad 2 well at all .slides around because the iPad 2 is smaller..No pen loop either   design mistake.,1,0,292
ANQM9OUAX68P5,34,this movie is like so the not so awesome.we are watching it in school.me go to mater dei academy.and when i go home my ears hurt so much from all the... singing.i wish it only had like no singing and like what is up with the charectors dos man it is like way out there if ya know what im sayin.so i would not like refer this to anyone.if yall wanna watch tom sawyer watch the one with jtt.,2,0,389
ANRNTPGJ5AAY9,538,It seems like all of my reader friends had one so. I bought one too. It is light weight and easy to use. Great for the ematerials the library has to loan.,4,1,154
ANRPK5SZQ3535,0,Better than zip ties because these dont pinch and can be used over and over again. There cable ties really help to organize and keep away the possibility of people tripping on wires.,5,0,182
ANS9Y6OG766ZV,0,This is truly the best mouse I have ever used.  It obviously takes a little time to get used to.  Like any tool. you arent going to be a master immediately upon using it.  Ive had it for years now and I would not go back to a normal mouse.The problem as has been mentioned before is the dirt.  Any small amount of lint. grease. oil... on your hands migrates to the contact points.  The ball is slippery and requires regular cleanings.  If this exact same design were available in an optical format. I would buy that immediately.  The nearest designs are the Explorer by Microsoft. that I bought my brother for christmas last year.  It works fine. but I have become so used to this one.If you get a chance. or see an optical like this. jump on the opportunity to buy it .and let me know about it would you?..,4,1,807
ANSB7OILD0L3C,11,it constantly acts up.  i try to use it for my textbooks but when i try to turn the page it glitches and zooms in.  the touch screen randomly clicks things by itself. also doesnt allow returns.  would not recommend,1,0,214
ANSC8RWU4IT8Q,0,I gave this unit a try and ended up very disappointed .see other one star rating..  Without much invested in research and development. Sharp can afford to sell their recorders so cheap.  I returned my nonrecordable  minidisc recorder for Sharps next in line. the MDMT15.s. and instead of  quitting on me after only 3 days. it went an entire week before the dreaded  u0026quotUTOC ERRORu0026quot showed up and erased my music!  If you record a  CD straight through. without interruption. it works great.  Try to mix your  own. and it just chokes.  The result?  I returned to the store again.  and to avoid losing a customer. they agreed to replace my defunct Sharp  players for a comparable Sony. even if a comparable Sony is more than USD50  more!  My recommendation. stick with the original until the rest catch  up. even if you have to pay more.,1,0,847
ANSE5AEYKABM3,66,I dont think this antenna works well when having dark tinted glass.  So I cant really say it doesnt work. but obviously it didnt work for me.,2,0,141
ANSR0LCACFPRV,0,I bought this antenna for my girlfriend because she gets lousy reception with her cheap rabbit ears.  The UHF reception improved dramatically. but the VHF reception didnt improve at all!  I was kinda embarrassed for getting her something that didnt really work.  I cant say Ive found a better antenna yet. but for the price this one wasnt worth it.,3,0,348
ANT6VNLW5DZ87,22,I have had mine almost 1 year. I really like reading on it. I love the instant gratification of getting the books when I want them. However...1. I have run across several books NOT available through Nook which is irritating.2. Some books REQUIRE WiFi. I bought the 3G version bc I do not usually have access to WiFi. But some books require WiFi to download. This is not noted anywhere until after you buy the book and try to download it via 3G.3. Sample Books for Free. When I have tried this all I ever download is the book description. which I can read anyway.4. Lend Me. Only SOME books .decided by Bu0026N. are available to be lent .most of mine are not. and once you lend a book to someone. they have access to it for 2 weeks and then you can NEVER loan it to them or anyone else ever again. Bu0026N is not very upfront about this.5. The web browser is a joke...dont plan on doing much with it.6. The dictionary is incomplete and clunky.7. Sometimes I have trouble downloading books via 3G. Bu0026N customer service attributes this to spotty 3G coverage in my area which I question since I live outside a major metropolitan area and have no problems with my iPhone ever.,3,0,1175
ANTSHDDDGX9AJ,45,These are okay. They do work. but there bond provides a lot of bulk. After purchasing these I became aware of the Velcro brand Reusable SelfGripping Ties which come with 50 in the pack and was MUCH happier with those. Those are much more compact and dont have a  fuzzy  part like these Belkin ones do. Also. these Belkin ones have a tag that says  Belkin  on them that stick out which further adds to the bulk of the tie you are trying to make.,2,0,444
ANUAMR768GYRF,0,I was confused at first if i needed both parts one is a transmitter and one is a receiver but you do need both I used it for a remote jack for my dish network connection you have to have or be charged a extra 5.00 a month. Works fine,5,1,233
ANUKPTOTI7MAX,22,I have owned this cam for about 2 years and generally like it. I use it with Net Meeting and Yahoo and the others on the other end say the picture is great. for taking snapshots the quality is great. Keep in mind that web cam quality is largely dependent upon bandwith.What I wish this camera had that the Intel camera has is the ability to import video from my video camera. Intel has slot in back of their camera for this and this one does not.,4,1,446
ANVZRY1ZG8I78,44,These a very good set of speakers for only USD80. I wanted to use them in a surround sound setup for my bedroom. The directions were very brief and did not explain the AV hook up at all. It comes w white and red AV jacks. My  tv has a white u0026amp yellow hook up. so I put the white in the white and  the red in the yellow and tried to get a signal with the speakers but all I  got was static. I tried this for my stereo and vcr too the same result  occured. I then decided to put the white in the white and the red in an  extra white hook up on my vcr and the result was a great sound quality. One  speaker has low static the other is perfect. Great speakers. but beware of  the AV jacks it might not be applicable with all AV hook ups.,4,1,739
ANWRS4O920M72,1831,The Nook Simple Touch is a great little ereader. Its easy to use and displays books well. It handles pdf files better than my husbands Sony T1 reader. which I have been delighted by as I often get review copies of books in pdf format.The builtin WiFi is only used to access the Nook store and sync your digital library between Bu0026Ns servers and your reader.The only feature I would like would be a builtin web browser. It would be nice to be able to get on the local librarys digital library with my reader directly instead of having to download the files to my computer first.,4,1,580
ANX9XYCX10XZ0,44,This radio is great.  I work on the 35th floor of an office building and I get great AM reception. I am so glad I bought this.,5,0,126
ANXU9GIZTZA0Q,22,Good Mic.  You just need to stretch the cord for a while.  When new. a little stiff.  Good audio  not great  but it is a speaker mic and that is usually the case.  Would I buy another  yup.,4,1,189
ANXUKN0N0MGOG,0,Good product but could use a plastic window for the screen and a opening in the back for external hookups.,4,0,106
ANY6JUFM0GH8U,22,I lost my Bu0026N original cable.  I looked around for an new one.  I tried  a different. cheaper model but it didnt fit my device properly so back to the drawing board.  I ordered this one.  I am satisfied.  It works exactly as expected and fits perfectly.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter.,5,1,365
ANYDZR5QUIYN8,22,It took them forever to send it out. than it never got to my address. than finally I was gone for a job in Europe. than a week ago I got an email notice that it was returned to sender.I replied to them with an email immediately. and never heard from them again since.So I never got the Item.One thing is sure. this company is not very quick but extremely slow. Slow with sending. slow with responding.Maybe next year Ill get it. I am so happy it was nothing expensive.,1,0,468
AO02M8LOHL2HU,0,It is good for my PC and works well for 2 month. It looks not fit for high power equipment.,4,0,91
AO0E8D9LAAICQ,11,This item does its job. Might not be massive enought to protect from a thief equiped with a metal cutter butgood enought to protect from oportunity crime. Its a pain though to cary around the keys with you so I would prefere a combination lock if I had to buy it again.,3,0,269
AO0NR2F9CLMPX,0,Very convenient having a storage for my floppies. and I love the colors. Memorex has very reliable media.,5,0,105
AO0R2V7M2T2Q5,14,I was given this Nook as a gift.......On balance I like the reading experience much more than I thought I would.It is lightweight and easy to hold in one hand while I read. Can read easily with the light from a lamp. or using the lightedscreen. And can easily adjust the font size as well as the various fonts offered. I honestly cannot see a big difference betweenthe several builtin fonts. I cannot guess at the Nook Glowlights durability after one week.To be fair...I think this device would be very competitive in a world of many ebook choices and offerings. However after some little experience I have some concerns.My first inclination after receiving this as a gift was to find a cover to protect it and the screen. The Barnes and Noble store had some covers. but even the salesperson was not able to recommend them with a straight face. So far the online offerings are slim to none. Hope someone solves it. A well designed cover would enhance this product greatly.I discovered that it is difficult to turn on in the dark. Seems pretty basic. and can be accomplished. although not gracefully. I may have missed something in the directions on this.The reader has many books available for a cost. of course. and for free. Finding the free books is more difficult than the priced ones. but doable. However. I am concerned that of the few books I have wanted to buy via the Nook. in comparison with the Kindle ebooks. those books that I have looked up have been substantially more expensive via the Nook.

AO2PLTSJTAJD2,11,I bought this player a couple of months ago.  It suddenly stopped working after trying to play Cruel Intentions.  I was happy with they player up until this point.I just brought it in for servicing.  Thanks for the  info!,4,1,221
AO3D4LUISDQFC,24,I have enjoyed this case very much.  Its belt clip has a little hook at the bottom. making it very unlikely that the case will come off of your belt.  I have three criticisms of the case.  Other than these three things. I love it. The first problem is that its closure is velcro.  As anyone familiar with velcro knows. it is easy to mess velcro up if the hook side comes in contact with cloth.  The result is that the case gradually closes less securely.  But if you dont wear sweaters or anything that might clog up the hooks. you have no worries with this problem. The second problem is that the very hook which makes it so secure on a belt makes it very uncomfortable without a belt.  It can dig into your hip.  To me this is very minor.  I just adjust its position such that it is no longer uncomfortable. The third problem is what burns me up.  The mechanism that holds the belt clip on my case recently .after about 5 months. bent.  This made the belt clip MUCH less secure.  The case can sort of twist about now.  Its a good case  extemely convenient  but be aware that its not built to last long unless you treat it carefully.,3,0,1134
AO4CRZ2ZAYTN9,33,Used this for a trail ride through the forest.  It worked pretty well with a small antenna.  Hopefully soon I can install something larger to attach it.  The sound came through nice and clear. although I didnt have very much range with my antenna.This radio is actually a bit smaller than I thought it would be. which is nice.The plastic volume knob broke into pieces on the first one. but Amazon quickly replaced it.  Hopefully this new one holds up better.,4,1,458
AO4ZALF33HP0,0,If you want a multiCD changer driveplayer for your home .separate component. stereo system. this is a good choice.  Mine works flawlessly and has good sound qualities. It closely matches my older .nonJVC. RCVRAMP unit in size and looks.  It is not portable though and takes up a fair amount of cabinet space but for the money. this is a good deal IMHO.,4,1,352
AO56GTRSZJWIG,22,After about 2 years of use. my Panasonic DVD A120 also started displaying u0026quotNO PLAYu0026quot on its front window. along with the message. u0026quotThis Type of Disk Cannot Be Played. Please Insert A Different Disku0026quot on my television. It started out only effecting a few rental movies. but now effects a majority of disks. I am going to buy a newer JVC or Panasonic DVD player to replace it.I have found many DVDs will play if I open and close the DVD tray several times.  When this works. the DVDs play without any problems with all DVD functions available.  For some disks. it takes an intolerable number of open and close cycles to get lucky. For others. it never works.,2,0,686
AO5826Y9WCAKS,33,Obviously there are much better mp3 players on the market today.  This was the first one ever sold.  It was state of the art back in 2000.  It worked well and I got some good use out of it.,4,1,189
AO5BRGQW2XOKI,0,This is my first GPS so i dont know any other brands. I do not own a BMW or a Mercedes so i cant tell you the difference with a builton system.Sure it is kind of slow to acquire satellites at times but then what difference does it make if it takes at most 30 seconds more than builton systems? I dont think youre going to get lost as soon as you get out of your parking lot. are you?As long as it takes me to my destination. i dont care. I find the detailed maps to be really precise. the only problem is you have to buy them separately for an extra .dollar amount. because the default map is not good unless youre only doing highway driving...,4,1,644

AO6IXF7J8IWZN,0,It works well but was in poor condition.  The powersync cord did not work and I had to buy a new one.  The memory card does not have the available memory that it was supposed to and I had to pay to have it cleaned up.,2,0,217

AO7QFT08RDZJ4,11,I finally upgraded to a Palm V from the Palm Professional. and what a great decision it was.  This lightweight PDA has a better display. and I use it exclusively for all my planning. addresses. todo list. memos.  email. etc!  Great for a working mom on the go like me.  I love being able  to divide my various activities and lists by personal. business. client.  etc.  And beaming appointments and such to my husbands Palm V is an added  plus. so that were always u0026quotin syncu0026quot.  Hot Syncing always creates  a permanent record similar to a day planner. but without all the paper!  The only negative is the case it comes with. so I ordered the leather case  which is small enough to fit in a purse or pocket.  Hubby uses the hard  case. which fits easily in his suit pocket. A great planning tool!,5,1,808
AO7UCXEBBX2JR,2022,This DVD is nice!  I read reviews before I bought this product. yet I took a chance.  It was worth it!  Bottom line... I rented DVDs from Blockbuster and one was sort of dirty.  I had to use my cleaner wipes and  it was brand new.  Some folks dont know how to handle discs. thats the  only time it paused!  I like it!,5,1,317
AO7Y7FRNMV4TN,35,Its not worth the money. Look elsewhere. It was intended for my 14year old daughter. As I figured. the u0026quotBarbieu0026quot camera for my 5year old is doing much better. JamCam 2.0 is also better. Each of them costs much  less then the u0026quotSMILEu0026quot.I believe there are few more cameras out  there for similar price.

AO9S2CH1VCDIN,0,After discussing with the company and sending pictures to make sure parts werent missing. and no instructions or description to know otherwise. bc Ive never owned one before to know. It seems everything that was suppose to be in the package was there. I need this product for a school function and for the price. compared to others. its a deal. Works fine. A bit unstable. But it works for what I need. I would recommend. Like I said. for the price. Its worth it compared to the more expensive backdrops.,4,1,504

AOBGKBBDODKIP,0,I bought this to transfer very old floppy files to a thumb drive. I plugged the USB drive into a Windows 7 64bit computer and it was immediately recognized.  This was a oneoff transfer. it worked and I wont use it again. Dealing with a floppy made me appreciate modern data storage. God love anyone still using floppies...they have the patience of a saint. File transfers are slow because of the old technology. not the drive. The 4th star was for the easy plug and play. otherwise my rating is a neutral 3.,4,1,507

AOEUEZO3SIDQQ,11,Well. when I bought this junk I saw numerous negative reviews and some positive ones.  The incredibly low price and the handful of positive reviews made me take a jump into this morass.  DONT FOLLOW ME IN BOYS AND GIRLS!  This stuff is junk.  My wife and I walk our two dogs in the evening and of course now. in November. in Milwaukee. it is getting dark early. so we need flashlights.  I bought a highpower Remington flashlight from Batteries Plus. a regional battery store.  It uses lithium ion batteries that cost an arm and a leg. .A123.  We walk the dogs for a minimum of 45 minutes each night and have the flashlight on for that whole time.  I got 6 batteries with this order.  One set. which was a different make. recharge in 5 minutes and then last 5 minutes.  The other two sets last an hour. thats it.  THATS NOT THE MOST ANNOYING PART!  The worst part of this situation is that when the batteries run out of charge they just quit. immediately!  No dimming of the light gradually. no warning!  In an instant you are in total darkness!  If you dont have a backup plan you are out of luck.  Also. the charger is made very cheaply and one contact is already not making good contact with the battery unless I bend it.,1,0,1223

AOFRBNBRQFW5Y,12,Had Phillips CD recorder before and returned it to get this one.Music quality wise. they are both good. but this one was much more easy to use.  Plus it had optical inout. coaxial digital inout. and analog inout.  there are not too many recorders that provide all these inputs and outputs.if you want perfect replications of your CDs. this is what you need.  burning with computer cd writer. it converts the file to wav file and that reduces the music quality,5,1,459
AOGJM6T31TGO6,33,For some of you who might be in the same boat as I was in a couple of days ago.I used my Palm III to the point where the graffiti pad had slight scratches in it and it would no longer correctly recognize letters in memos. which is primarily what I use it for.  Since the warranty had run  out. I was thinking about upgrading to a Plam V instead of paying the  repair fee. However. someone else lower in this list mentions the  company CIC and a software called Jot.  They offer free sample downloads  and have programs to allow you to write on the whole screen and not just in  the Graffiti area.  Thus. I am able to avoid the area of my screen that no  longer functions as well..the software is a nice  alternative to repairs or unnecessary upgrades.I only mention this  because anyone who uses his or her palm enough is bound to run into this  frustrating u0026quotscar tissueu0026quot problem. TomIncidentally. I rate the  Palm V. which I test in stores with four stars since they really should  improve this problem and there is no improvement in Graffiti technology  between the Palm III and the V.,4,1,1103

If you are unfortunate enough to purchase one of these or receive it as a gift and for some reason do not want to take it back. here is a tip.  IF you can get a CD to load properly and the speakers are not detached. do not turn the volume up above a whisper.  The vibration makes the CD skip.  That is if you can get the CD to start playing at all.  The sound u0026quotqualityu0026quot is terrible. a complete waste of money.,1,0,523

AOJV07IXMAQBF,23,I have bought one. I love the auto wind feature and the sound quality is okay. But the rewind button should be designed more hidden. cause sometime it may be touched too easily.

AOMQZAS76F3V3,0,.update. I find my review written about Nook HD included here for an entirely different model tablet. Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.Nook HD overviewGreat screen. no cameras. weak speakers. crappy battery life. compromised android OS. but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast. beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course. its original purpose. to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example. Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed its easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that autodeletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700.000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps. Google earth. Skype. YouTube in HD. Adobe Reader. WiFi Analyzer. WiFi Fixer .essential Wifi tool.. Google maps. best solitaire ever .by MobilityWare.. and free run games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage. but it never works! .It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this.Poor battery life. by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend. so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Builtin email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy .pushing Home and Vol requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes..Nook HD not really useful for music. sans headphones. because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge. but I find this hit or miss. it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB. but have some annoyances. Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories .like kids Bu0026N files. only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way .that I have found. to add personal data for quick entry..update.Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet .Blackberry Playbook.. but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine. but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput .available on Play Store.. It now does the pairing. not Nook OS. and you select the bluetooth keyboard using Switch Keyboard icon..update.Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home. but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher .with carousel. ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher. and it will show them on the home screens.,3,0,3834

This was done in November 2013 as a Xmas present to be given to my grandsons in Dec 2013. Both came in damaged. I put in a claim thru Amazon and  buy accessories  answered stating they would not deal with me and that their warranty is only 21 days. I tried to put in a claim to Amazon  A to Z warranty  that states that it is specifically for cases when the third party seller wont cooperate. After about a dozen emails with Amazon they also refused to help me saying I have to deal with  Buy Accessories . Amazon will not even acknowledge their AZ warranty is or is not valid. Most certainly a catch 22 position. They finally tired me out !If anyone has had a similar experience I would like to know if there is a way I can get my money back.By the way .Bu0026N has offered to refund me only 50% of the moneyB.Vega,1,0,922

AOS8CUWFT14YI,23,I received this model as a gift from my wife about six years ago.  She thought its short wave feature would interest me.  That feature never actually never worked. unless you are fluent in Russian or Polish.  For most of its life. it spent more time in a dresser drawer than traveling with me.  Its AM tuning was short lived. its FM tuning had a habit of drifting. and its its battery life was short. so I used its transformer function. ac to dc 4.5. Finally. the power button gave out.  You would press it down.  In two seconds. it would pop right out.  I was checking to see if there was a repair center when I came on Amazon.  Now. Im putting it in the trash.  WMT,1,0,667

AOY9SZTMNQWAW,4755,Ive had all the other Nooks and this is the first that I truly love.  The touch screen is accurate and quick. there is no reflection at all. page turns are quicker than the other Nooks.  Its very light. the archiving and rating process is much much easier.  Shopping is easier as well.  Im in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook. now I love them equally.  Of all the Nooks. I think this is the best one. I love it.  I only wish it was 3g.  Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.  When I read on this Nook .just like the other 2.. it doesnt sync with online so when I then use my Iphone Im not at my current page.  In this area. the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.  Im not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.  Im waiting patiently for MEdge to release their new covers so that I can use my MEdge light with both my Nook and Kindle.,5,1,937
AOZZ0CTG5RMW1,23,I bought this mounting bracket to go with a tv we just bought. It is a beautiful unit and is much cheaper than most others in stores and online. It was however the wrong size for the 32inch that we bought. We needed a 200 x 400 size. Luckily they also sell adapters to make it fit the tv so it was an easy fix and still really inexpensive. Make sure you know what size you need when ordering or you will delay the mounting  of your tv. It was very easy to assemble and install.,4,1,477
AP0ZL2WX8J0JD,0,Does not work at all on my brand new PC .98se. usb.. very bad software. support is helpless... Advertised Audible format is not actually supported .yet they say.... Dont buy now... this is a rushed out .though late.  buggy product...,1,0,233

AP28FUT7R7FEQ,0,This is a very handy portable CB handheld... But it is somewhat lacking for use when installed in my truck.  The volume is somewhat limited and it seems to have weak reception even with a full size. properly tuned antenna.  Its important to note that the external antenna connection does not work well unless the portable antenna on top is removed and replaced with a BNC terminator.  Also. Ive purchased two of these and the volume on the second one is even more limited.All in all a handy little device. but it doesnt quite live up to the advertising.,3,0,553

AP491MZQ1CIXP,11,There are no specs for this cable ... from the image. it looks like it has a minib adapter on one end. which would not work with the newer Motorola Cliq as this claims .newer Cliq uses a microb adapter..  This looks more like a Blackberry cable from the image.,3,0,260
AP4A738DN7FWV,0,This USB is really cute but a week after having it the Bow part fell apart from the USB. It was bonded by hot glue gun. if i would have known I would have gone for a much durable inexpensive one instead.,3,0,203
AP4SF980ZYO7M,11,The memory card is not custom formated as advertised.  It was not formated at all.  It would not work in my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I was going to get a 30% restocking fee and it was going to be treated as a used part.  After talking to Amazon about the problem I was having.  they were forced to give me a full refund.  This card goes for about USD50 from other sellers.  Buy from them and get a USB Micro SD card reader and format it your self to FAT32.  They sell a 64G Micro SD card with a Mico SD USB Card reader for USD68.  It worked great after doing formating to FAT32 on my own with the USB card reader.,1,0,608
AP4YPAXC7YZL3,55,This tablet is awesome...it took me 10 minutes to root it and turn it into a complete Android tablet legally...i did this without changing anything that originally came with the tablet...so now i have the barnes u0026 nobles  tablet with full Android market...best of both worlds...simply awesome,5,1,296
AP5D7UI9US2EG,2125,I purchased the SONY DVPS530D on 102399.  The first movie I watched was the MATRIX.  Awesome movie.  It looked great and sound great on my stereo.  But then I watched the u0026quotMaking of the Matrixu0026quot segment and halfway  through Keanu Reeves mouth was moving but his voice did not match up with  the video.  After reading other lipsync stories on Amazon. I am returning  this lemon and buying a Toshiba.,3,0,413

AP7OVNK9BZLGH,23,About a month ago I wrote an extensive review of this Advent product.  I was very critical.  Awkward controls. poor reception. etc.  The bottom line is that I thought the quality was so bad that I returned it for a refund.  Then I bought a Sennheiser wireless model. and I have been mostly pleased with it. 92501,1,0,312
AP8LOOMV54XQ,4550,After using Kindle the Nook was a disapointment,2,0,47

AP91TRN3KDIRH,67,I used this product to mount my 32 inch Olevia. It is working good so far.  I dont really plan to do too much movement. but I wanted to have the option.  This mount does the trick.  It seems to be a good value.  It is not flimsy. but just based on its small size. if you TV weighs more than 35 lbs dont plan on doing too much movement. The instructions dont give you the hint. but I suggest unbolting the plate from the arm. securing it to the TV. mounting the rest of the arm to the wall. and the rebolting the TVplate onto the arm.,4,1,533

APCKRIFOL28AM,0,I am now on my second Sony S530 DVD player within one year.  The first functioned fine .with the exception of the occasional lip sync problem. for the first 9 months.  Then suddenly. it wouldnt power on at all!  I sent it  in to be fixed. and the tech told me that the integrated circuit board on  this model heats up too fast. thus causing the unit to shut down.  My local  retailer then swapped out a new unit for me. which worked fine for just  under 90 days.  Then wouldnt you know it. the same problem happened with  the replacement unit as well!  Normally the same problem hapenning to the  same person twice points to customer abuse. but I pamper all of my  equipment and treat it better then anyone I know.  Also. I highly doubt  that the problems were due to surge problems. as my equipment is plugged  into the new reference Monster Power HTS5000.  I just cant believe how  horrible this machine is.  I have an ES reciever. a Wega tv. a Sony  portable u0026amp component minidisc player. and a Sony CD player as well.  All have worked beautifully and have never had a single problem.  I  expected a lot more from their dvd players and got lemons instead.  If my  second player is replaced as well. Im not even going to bother opening it  up at all.  Im going to sell it new and put my money towards a Toshiba  instead.,1,0,1328
APCSW2SLX8SE6,44,With its two disc changer you only need to get up every 5 hours or so to change discs. In addition the picture quality is the best Ive ever seen on a DVD player. no pixellation. and a nice crisp picture.  Unlike some  players. that have remotes with a million buttons. this one is easily  understood and simple to use.  With the built in Dolby decoder you can have  surround sound without a dolby receiver.  All you have to due is hook up  three amplifiers to the player and make your own. Just go up to the attic  get that old stereo.you know the one with the 8track player. we all have  one. and hook them up to the back.  The instruction manual even tells you  how to configure your speakers.  This DVD player is great. its the best  birthday present Ive ever gotten.,5,1,770
APF6TYD5TE38B,11,Ive been waiting a long time for a digital camera  costing less than a grand with this range of features and quality output.  Of course. once you add NiMH batteries and a charger. additional storage. a lens cap strap .a  must.. a film reader to attach to your PC. a photo quality printer. photo  paper....well. OK. maybe itll take a year or two to pay back .. As pointed  out in the other reviews. it takes some practice not to press the power  instead of the shutter button  an embarrasing faux pas at this mornings  TBall game. as a matter of fact *smile...woops!*.  It also takes practice  to quickly move through the onscreen menu options.  It is way too easy to  inadvertently  choose an option you dont want. pressing this little  frisbee thingy on the back of the camera the wrong direction.  Plan for 56  hours of rampup time with this camera. even if you know photography and  computing well.,4,1,901
APFHCXPXVW3ZJ,56,I purchased this antenna for the ease of installation But i should have spent more and got a better product. This antenna went on my back window of my pickup with easeand stays there but it just doesnt work.I sit in a truck stop with trucks talking all around and it sounds all garbled .I cant transmit at all! For me it was a mistake!,1,0,335
APGCN777AZIYR,46,GREAT EARPHONES. CLEAR. AND VERY LITTLE DISTORTION.. I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE WITH A NOOK OR KINDLE. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT,4,1,134
APGTJGBDZ4OB6,0,I bought this item for a customer. There was so much electrical noise on the system that you couldnt hear a dial tone at all. I then took the system to my house which has a good grounding system thinking that the electrical interference would be minimized but found that although it would work. there was the electrical hum there also and very loud. I tried to use it for a fax line. but half the time the faxes wouldnt go through so I had to disconnect it and Im probably going to throw it away since Ive had it so long I dont feel right about returning it.,1,0,558

APJZFN88H983A,11,I have the latest model. the KV27FV17.  I suddenly had to replace my 1991 Sony KV27V75 when it passed away.  I really considered no other brand but Sony.  Picture quality was important and I knew that Sony would deliver.  But sound quality was critical as well.  The FV series has superior speakers and sound as compared to the FS series.  The only thing I do not like is the remote control.  If you are over 40. get out your cheaters  you will have a difficult time reading this remote.  Also of note is that even though this TV has two Svideo inputs. one of them is in the front.  And I am not crazy about the styling  gray color and a larger cabinet than my old Sony  but its the way most manufacturers are going these days.  All in all. you cant lose with this TV.  Plus. theres something about that SONY logo on the set that makes one feel a bit superior.,4,1,860
APKI25SAGOMUN,22,As described. fast delivery and worked. that was important.  Had tried another much more expensive one and that did not work for my camera even though it was listed that it would.,5,0,179
APKNTDAV6EPI4,0,Ive had this player now for about 3 months and have absolutely no complaints. The only warning I might give is that the manual says that the player doesnt play DVD audio CDs. I dont know how popular that format is  or will be. but so far. thats not a concern to me.The remote has a  joystick on it that you use to nagivate many of the menus. It can be a bit  difficult to use at times. The problem is that to select a menu item. you  press down on the joystick. Sometimes I acidentally press a direction on  the joystick while pressing the button down and miss the menu item I  intended to select. Its really a matter of getting used to it.Ive  never had problems with this player that Ive heard about with other  players. such as the audio track not being synched to the video track. It  has performed flawlessly in that regard.The best way to explain how I  feel about this player is that Id buy it again.,5,1,907
APKNTDAV6EPI4,5252,Ive had this receiver now for about 6 months. Overall. I like it. The sound is good. It has just about all of the connections I could possibly want. They included just about all of the cables I needed. except for the  optical cable. which turned out to be very expensive.One complaint that  I have is that this receiver is very complex. It stems from the fact that  it has so many features. However. the manual is awful at explaining how to  use the various features. .Yes. I read manuals..The remote control is  big. but nicely laid out. The main buttons I use .play. stop. volumne.  etc.. are large and easy to find by feel. Which is important to me while  Im watching movies in the dark.Im happy with this receiver. I would  buy it again. but Im still figuring out how to use all of the things its  capable of. If youre intimidated by technology. then this may not be the  receiver for you. If you want a good receiver at a reasonable price and are  willing to learn as you go. then this receiver may be a good choice.,4,1,1021
APL677N8SPQ2W,3233,Although I thought the device was a tad small at first. its power is incredible.  It made our weekly conference call clear to all parties involved rather than a billion  huh?  questions.,5,1,186
APM29HPJWEMTO,0,Got the ProPad for Christmas.  It loaded and plugged in real easy. but from then on it has been one big disappointment.  Tried to use it with Thief. and Tomb Raider 3. but it doesnt work.  TR3 she just runs around in circles.  With Thief you cant do anything but run. and you lose the map.  Check the calibration program folks. it  really could use some work.,1,0,359
APMUR51PEFGLV,55,Order arrived on time and well packaged. This was a great choice as an accessory. the cord is long enough were I can control it from where I am.

APO6ZNDXCCYDY,27,This is a good case that I received but one of them was cracked in half when I received it and the other has some cracks near the camera when I put it on.  It is an awesome case but not great quality.  I would buy some more.,3,0,224
APO9DUKG4L3Q6,0,I bought this tripod as means to use with my Canon Rebel with 75300mm lens. Literally the moment I clicked it into position on the tripod. the plastic shoe snapped off and my camera headed toward the floor. Thankfully I grabbed it before it did any damage to my camera. This tripod should be fine for any point and shoot camera but it is very bad idea for any nice SLR camera. especially with a long lens.,1,0,405

APQ7ZG4KC3FUN,2,These companies of HPCs are playing the market. This Jornada 680. has the size and portability that a laptop doesnt have. and I love it for that. but the features are pittyful! If the size were a little bigger. than they could easily put in a 10 Gig harddrive. 64mb ram. and 400+ mHz proccesor. A PERFECT example of this is a small sony laptop. but I do not remember the model name. It is a little larger than my Jornada. but has a 30 Gig HD. 700MHZ proccesor. 128 RAM. and Windows XP!!!... I recommend you wait. prices will DROP. and new FAST. SMALL. SEXY proccesors are coming out!!!,4,1,585
APQ8DDRE218QX,59,Unlike the other reviewer for this item. I have never had a problem with these tapes recording in the several different VCRs that I use. I have also recorded shows for friends and they have never said that their machines didnt like them either. so I have to assume that they played fine for them. as well.I do see that Amazon is now selling an 8pack for not that much more than this 4pack and thats much less per tape. so I would buy those in future. Of course. the quality cannot compare with DVDs but not everything is important enough for a DVD. In other words. I might want to record a movie or something like Masterpiece Classic just to watch a second time and then. if I really like it. I can buy the DVD. These tapes also seem to work well for everyday rerecording. I have one at my office that has had perhaps a dozen passes or more and the quality of the video and audio is still good.,4,1,894
APRFTIZ7PB4S8,1111,I love the fact that they work well. dont separate and can hold alot of cords at the same tome.  My husband hates seeing cables all mess  I always have a spare set for him.  All the cables are color coordinated at are place and these are the reason why,4,1,252
APSKK4NIGIBJZ,0,Immediately out of the box. this product made a loud buzzing noise.  It was so bad that a coworker in an office down the hall wanted to know what the noise was.  I stuck a floppy disk in. figuring Id use the device just long enough to retrieve the file I needed. but it didnt work.  NOTHING except noise.  I wish I could give this product NO STARS. because its not worth even one.  Bottom line.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!.,1,0,418
APT5BA10PRSOM,55,Ive had my camcorder for 2 12 weeks now and LOVE IT! Has lots of features but yet simple to operate. Great picture and I think the nightshot feature is cool. Cant go wrong on this one!,5,0,184
APTIH0D12OZFY,2329,Pros.  Overall good unit.  Great color. well built. very detailed.Cons.  I live in a new development and my home street is not on the map.  Software updates to the unit must be done with a serial port .included in box..  The problem is that my new laptop does not have a connector for the included cable.  Had to spend an additional USD13 on a USB to 9 pin serial cable and Garmin said its only a 80% success rate that it will transfer the neccessary data.  The Mapsource CDs which contain detailed information on cities can only be used one time.  In order to use the CDs initially. you have to go to the Garmin website and get an u0026quotunlocku0026quot code.  Therefore. if you purchase a newer computer. you have already used your unlock code and would have to purchase an addition code and these can range from USD80USD100.Since installing the Mapsource data. my comp has crashed 3 times.  I do not think it likes Win XP.,4,1,927
APTP07QR8Z4OW,0,Its fine. Does what its supposed to do. This product has been around so long there isnt anything to say,4,1,103
APUG0RIVP85LR,11,Im new to all this digital camera stuff so I bought one of the cheaper cameras at USD300 and came across this one. It works great! The only problem is that the screen on the back. drains your battey completely but if you  dont use the screen or use it for a really short time. itll be ok. I was  testing out the camera when I first got it and left the screen on for a few  minutes and it was already getting really low on battery so I had to  replace the batteries in around 15 minutes! Other than that. a great  camera. Its easy to use and the pictures come out good.,4,1,568
APVCBMAB5W2GV,0,Like most here. I had no problems with my A120 DVD player for the first 10 or 11 months of ownership.  Then I started getting consistent u0026quotNO PLAYu0026quot messages at about the 1year mark. with occasional errors in play plus minor pixellation or noticeable minor audio glitches.  I thought at first it had to to with dust or disk errors .even though I am a light renter. and take great care of the ones I own..  But the player soon had to be coaxed to play almost anything I owned  only by repeatedly opening and shutting the front tray could I get it to sometimes play a disk in spite of this.  Horribly frustrating. especially for an appliance thats in flawless condition. and seems way too new to me to simply conk out after light use.But its dead.  Now it wont play anything at all. and Im definitely an unhappy camper. Panasonic reps were rude and basically told me to u0026quotbuy another one.u0026quotUm... no.  Like I told Panasonic. I think Ill just try Sony next time instead... a really disappointing experience. from a company I used to trust. Stay away from Panasonic unless you can afford to replace what doesnt work the first time.,1,0,1154
APW7U8ASEYZIB,33,Once again. amazon.com has proven itself. The entire order was excellent. including the weather proof packing. which ironically. worked out well. as it poured rain the day it was delivered. The boombox works wonderfully. and NOONE can beat amazon.coms price. ENOUGH SAID!,5,1,271
APWLM3HOWBDBE,1516,I have not had the Nook very long. but my first impression is that I hate it and I should have gone for the Kindle.  The Nook is one of least userfriendly devices I have laid hands on.  It took me three days to get a book downloaded.  The screen is not very bright either.  Its just so much easier to drive the short distance to the library and grab a traditional book and skip all the headaches.,2,0,396
APX7CH7BOZDOP,24,The Magellan 300 is a good GPS for begginers . It is inexpensive and has a good battery life .as long as the backlight isnt used often.. It is waterproof and very durable. The Magellan 300 is a good GPS .,4,1,204
APX8SKVWCZBU1,1316,This card is a perfectly working card. when used in the correct phone. Please see ..... I will update this review and my discussion at tmobile as to what I find out.I just wish that the item did not state that it is for that particular model. Also. I think there should be more information on the Class 10 vs. Class 4. or just a general detailing of exactly what the difference is.,3,0,381
APXV4GM2BKZX1,0,This device was the second wind my old Panasonic digital camera needed. I connect the camera to the laptop with a serial cable wich makes it to slow .No USB cable.. so I tried this inexpensive alternative in order to revive my old camera wich still works perfectly. I needed a way to download the pictures from the CF card to the computer. Now. I can download in seconds what usually took hours.,5,1,395
APZA8SXX9DMT8,22,Having been a professional photographer for over 25 years I expected Nikon to produce superior results.  Forget that the camera is difficult to use. the final quality of the pictures is poor.  If you shoot only in sunlight  or shadow its OK. but mix them and the result is unacceptable.  No  latitude. or gamma. and even Photoshop fails to correct the problems.  Maybe in the future. but until then. buy something to play with but use  real film.  I returned mine...,1,0,466

AQ3VNDERZMMZO,0,This is the first time that I have bought a reciever of this type.  I was reading all the reviews and recommendations from everybody before I bought this sucker.  I actually bought it at a good price at the time . 379 bones  . knowing from comments that the manual was lousy.  I figured that it  shouldnt be all that bad since I have a technical degree.  Receiver was  great.  But it took me a fairly long time to get it work right with the  subwoofer . I had to fumble with a bunch of settings before I found the  right one ..  Still. its a great system for the future.,4,1,570
AQ5V7EF0IRQ8W,34,This was one of the best purchases I have ever made. Because of a limited amount of phone jacks I was going crazy with all the gadgets I use. I just plugged it into a regular wall socket and viola instant phone jack. Also very easy to hook up. Excellent product.,5,1,262
AQ6G126YJ9NB0,22,The only gripe I have with this radio is that the lighting is not strong enough to read the stations. Otherwise it is a very good buy for the price. It lacks all the mod cons such as a remote control and the like but we have Bose for that. I have two Bose radios and frankly they do have a better sound than the Grundig. They are also much more expensive! I am very happy with both the Bose and the Grundig but there is something about the Grundig that reminds me of plays on the radio in the late fifties when the radio was an important part of life. Of course this Grundig does not have the sound of the Grundig I had in Germany. That one almost had a place at the dinner table such was its presence. Nothing is as we remember it. I am very glad to have this as a reminder of simpler and perhaps happier times. The times when the attention span was not determined by a remote control.,4,1,886
AQ9EYRTOB9KYD,810,Although one will immediately get the impression that these are great. easy to use labels. digging deeper. they begin to reveal their problems. It seems as if with every other printing job. the alignment is off. even when used with a very professional and versatile printer. The labels are great when printing simple CDR booklets for friends. but be weary. Even independent bands will be dissatisfied with these thin matte labels.,2,0,430
AQA9PLI2LH3MK,89,It works. I use it to plug portable hard drives into. The through put seems pretty good. It works fine.,4,1,103
AQAMGFJ2O2DGR,0,I bought a couple of these to connect to some TalkAbout radios for use while skiing.  We tuck the radio in the pocket and clip the mic outside the pocket and zip the pocket closed.  Turn the volume up to max on the radios and you have easy 2way communication without removing gloves.  They have been used in very snowy conditions. and once they did experience some difficulty due to freezing in wet conditions. but overall I rate them highly for the price.,4,1,456
AQAP8CJXOUTC6,56,i recently purchased this tape . 12 pkg. bundle . because i recently purchased a new dvdvhs combo and didnt want any old tapes going into it.i record hours upon hours of all types of programs and after viewing irecord on it again. tdk . a leader in vhs tapes and much . much more stoodthe challenge i gave it. brand name . quality and price was the reason for this purchase. note. keep your tapes in vhs plastic containers . buya quality vhs head cleaner . make sure if your vhs is wet or dry forcleaning . and these tapes will last quite awhile. i suggest not putting in old tapes of any sort because it will eventually wear out your player.a tdk wet or dry cleaner works great. remember. u get what u pay for andwith tdk and proper care your all set. ps. if u are going to record thruyour vcr or digital camera their are higher grades by tdk and i suggestyou get those so u can view for many yrs to come.  don barajas,4,1,919
AQAS700BP7E5Q,99,The HDMI cable shown here will not plug into the Wii console.  This cable is shown with two HDMI cable ends.  The Wii console has a special socket in which the Wii supplied cable plugs then the other end plugs into the TV set.  The best that one can get is apparently COMPONENT video cable with Red. Blue. Green video plugs and the Red and White audio RCA plugs for the TV.Wii will produce 480p which is considered High Definition and is a step up from 480i. which is also considered High Definition.The HDMI cable is not required to obtain the 480p resolution for High Definition TVs.But  dont buy a plain old HDMI cable for a Wii.,1,0,632

AQBEDOW04NC9S,0,If you shlep a heavy laptop on trips just to get your email. do a little bit of web browsing or write some notes. this is for you. You just put the Jornada in your pocket or briefcase and attach the phone cable to its handy built in modem.  The battery lasts so long .sometimes 8 hours. that you can travel for several days without even taking the power adapter.  The whole system weighs only about 1 lb. The keyboard is OK but might be problematic if you have fat fingers.Although you can download Word or PowerPoint documents from your desktop and carry them around. the graphics are not good enough for technical presentations.  However if you use mainly plain text and your PowerPoint presentations are mainly big pie charts and so on. this is another great feature.  I found out that HP sells a VGA adapter card for the Jornada.  This little plug in card lets you download your MS PowerPoint presentation into the little travel computer and then output it to a VGA monitor or projector with graphics up to 768x1024.  So not only can I carry the Jornada on trips to get my email. but I can also download my presentation .up to about 16 MB. and output it to the clients projector or monitor.  Since the presentation comes from the computers memory. it is very fast. Great!,5,1,1275
AQBGIZ9JLVJVF,9595,Im 73 so I really like the large fonts.  But that is it.  The nook is heavy. poorly balanced. offers only a small edge for holding and thus cramps the fingers.  It is nothing like reading a book.  The glass front and the gloss white trim are highly reflective.  You have to hold it at just the right angle or it is very tiring on the eyes.  This increases the fingerwrist cramping.  If you think you will get your books cheaper  forget it.  I wanted to order a current book and found the nook was only USD3 cheaper.  Only the classics are at low prices.  The battery always needs charging.  The bookmarking and dictionary features are hopelessly cumbersome.  All in all. the nook is a technodisaster.  I picked up a kindle at the store the other day.  It is light and feels good in the hands.,2,0,792
AQBN6OLTGNWNL,44,Ive just got it yesterday. its a great look view with u0026quotiMac likeu0026quot style. But when I install it. i get into trouble. I dont like USB device. since its probably unstable on the Windows platform.  althought the transfeer speed is five time then pareall port.The memory  seems better then Creative NOMAD .nomad has 32mb internal. 32mb external. .  but 64MB is not enough when I tried higher sample rate for MP3 encoding  .160K for 60Min CD . maxinium is 256K.And the memory module is expensive  for 32MB100 USD. its incredible price!Totally. if you want to buy the  Rio 500 right now. its a good choice and ill bet you will like it. but if  you want to buy a MP3 PlayerWalkman in the near future. I suggest you  prefer the  Creative NOMAD 2 .NOMAD 2 is not released yet.  multifunctional. greate style. and much more memory size.,3,0,841

AQDLV4HBF7ZPK,6,Well. I have had my GPS 315 for about 2 weeks now. I have put about 30 hours on it. and I have really enjoyed it.  It was very easy to use. I was up and running with it two minutes after I had it out of the box.  The manual that is included makes it very easy to learn to use all of the features. and also explains how to use the more complicated features of the GPS.There are several things that make this GPS very handy.  the 12channel receiver is great for getting a very accurate reading when you are in a vehicle. or under dense tree cover.  There are 9 navigation screens that are quite useful. but. I find myself using the position. compass. and plot screens most.There are two things that would make this GPS perfect.  The first would be waterproofing.  It would be nice if you could take it out in the boat. and not have to worry if it slipped out or your hand. or got soaked by a large wave.  The other thing that would be nice. is a built in electronic compass but you can carry a compass along easily enough.All in all. a great GPS for a hike through the woods. or a ride in the boat.  This will give you piece of mind next time you go hiking down that unknown trail. or paddling down that long winding river.  Great GPS packed full of features for the money.,4,1,1271

AQGSAZBQTA4,55,We ordered these for 2 flat screens we bought for our kids rooms.  As we were attempting to secure the wall mount to the wall we realized that the screws that came with the mount had heads way too small so there was no way to secure the mount to the wall itself.  Those same screws are meant to secure the tv to the mount as well .there are only one size of screws sent. are too long to fit into the tv so we now have to make a trip to the hardware store to find something that will work properly.  I may amend this if were able to actually find the screws and get them hooked up for very eager children.,2,0,604

AQJQP7RPKQGI9,11,I want to review the Bu0026N Nook having installed the latest software release.  Yes. the Nook had a rough beginning with buggy sofware due to a rush to market release.  That is the case for many electronic devices and software titles for that matter.  To start with. I can say that just about all complaints about the Nook have been addressed in the latest release.  There are a few additional features that I would like but even those will added on future releases.  For those of you considering purchasing a new ebook reader. I hope to share information that I have found to help in you decision.  There are 3 major ebook readers on the market with several more on the way.  The Kindle. Nook. and Sony ereaders.  I really dont think any one particular ereader is better than the other as the all have their strengths and weaknesses.  After much thought. I chose the Nook.  First off. I would like to say that there is plenty of debate going on about ebook readers vs the new IPad.  IMO. not worth comparing.  I looked at the IPad and dont see me reading too much on it because of the lcd screen.  I work on computers all day and thats the last thing my poor ole tired eyes want to see when I get home.  I also wanted a dedicated reading device because I know that I would be playing with all of the apps on the IPad and would get no reading done.  The eink technology is great despite what some technogeeks say.  Its only going to get better but for now its what made be want to get an ebook in the first place.  The battery life between a device with eink and the Ipad isnt even close.  10 hours for the Ipad vs 710 days.  Anyway.  The Ipad is nice if you travel and need everything in one device.  Im not here to cut down the Ipad as it has its place but it just isnt as good of a device for reading ebooks as the new eink technology simple because eink looks better. its easier on the eyes. and the battery lasts much much longer.I have researched the 3 major brands of ebook readers on the market today and heres what I found.Kindle. Somewhat proprietary in that it cant read epub books which is somewhat of an ebook standared.  Not so much of a problem since many of the epub books available for free are also available in the kindle format for free anyway.  The battery life is exceptional on the Kindle.  The Kindle has been out longer and I find that many sites produce the public domain books in the Kindle format so not having the ability to read epub books is less of an issue.Nook. The Nook can read Barnes u0026 Noble books as well as Epub books.  I personally find the ability to read epub books the greatest advantage of the Nook.  After all. its all about the number of books available more than the features of the reader.  I have found and loaded many epub books on my Nook.  There are plenty of web sites that offer these free public domain books.  Yes. the Kindle does have a lot of free content but it does not have all of the epub books.  I also very much like the 3G connectivity on the Nook.  I have found myself many times in places without wifi access just scrolling through the book titles on the Barnes and Noble site looking for my next download.  You can also view the free ebooks on their site and read an overview of each book.  I also like that the Nook will automatically attempt to connect to a wifi hotspot first and then the 3G connection if it cant connect via wifi.  The Nook is also built on the Android operating system so many of the applications built for that operating system will eventually become available to the Nook.  The Nook has a user replaceable battery which at this time is around USD30 .Not bad at all!!..  The internal memory is about the same on the Nook as other devices but you can also install an additional Micro SD card.  I have done this and it is another major advantage to me personally.  I load all my personal epub books on the additional SD card and the books I download from the Barnes and Noble site go to the devices internal memory.  The books from Barnes and Noble are stored on their server and will always be available to redownload should something happen to the Nook.  The ebooks on the additional sd card are backed up on my computer.  I feel that I am covered should something happen to my Nook.  I also load mp3 audio books. mp3 songs and photos to the additional SD card because they are memory hogs and I want to leave the built in memory available for downloads.  I do have 3 bad things to say about the Nook.  First. the touch screen on the bottom could have been better.  I like the funcionality of it but the touch sensitivity is off.  It works great for traversing the menus and such but for page turning it really needs work.  It does work and you can get better at it with the right touch but nothing close to the ipad touch screen.  Its not a show stopper by any means.  It works better if you flick in the lower left corner of the screen for some reason but if you cant get it. just use the page turn buttons.  Second. the battery life isnt as good as the Kindles.  You can greatly improve it if you turn off the wifi3G access but it would still be several days shorter.  To me its worth it.  The wifi3G access is easy to disable.  Just use the Airplane mode and turn it on which disables everything and back on when you want to search for books.  The color lcd screen shuts itself off automatically within a few seconds when it detects no activity.  This works very well.  The battery life again is not a showstopper.  Its not as good as the Kindles but its good enough.  Lastly. the Nook has wifi access capability and a web browser.  This needs much improvement.  The wifi is good for downloading books especially if youre in a bad 3G coverage area.  The web browsing is in a beta mode right now and Im hoping that this improves.  It is both awkward and slow which makes its use very limited.  Yes. it does work in a pinch but boy how combersome it is to use.Sony Ereaders.  Sony is in a bit of a different light than the Kindle or Nook.  They have several different models with different features so it would be too much to review them all.  I have read that all models except their Pocket Edition have tremedous glare due to the touch screen.  I guess that would have to be a personal decision as to whether or not that bothered you.  From what I noticed. there is much more glare so you will be switching the angle of the reader to find the right spot.  The touch screen is a nice feature though so its worth considering for those who intend to write a lot of notes highlighting.  I like the pocket edition.  It doesnt even come close to the features of the Kindle or Nook but it is worth considering.  It doesnt have any wifi or 3G connectivity so all of your books will have to be downloaded via your PC and then loaded to your sony ebook reader.  For some this wont be a big deal but for others it will.  If this isnt a show stopper for you then the price of the ebook makes it a nice contender.  The price recently dropped USD50 and even lower at some places making this a real bargain in that it can be purchased for nearly USD120.00 or more cheaper than its competitors.  This would be great for those who are budget conscience and who isnt these days.  The outer casing is made of aluminum and is very strong.  It doesnt have the glare issue found on its bigger brothers.  It can read epub books so thats a plus.  The battery is not user replaceable but for this price I suspect youll get years of use out of it and newer better devices will be on the market by the time it dies.Well. I own the Nook and I will update this as I find anything new whether good. bad. or otherwise....,5,1,7690

AQNQHPRR3WQU1,0,This device has a major design flaw and does not prevent thieves from cutting it up.  I used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter.  Mind you. the lock portion was destroyed. not the cable.  The thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers.  Basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with formidablyequipped metal cutter.,1,0,538

AQPMA5BSS9SZD,2,Bought and quickly returned the product within 10 days. Bought this item primarily to get a better picture quality than my old VHSC. Under optimal light conditions. worked just great. Under too much of Sun. the colors are  not at all true and the picture appears too garish. On the other hand.  under low light condition. the picture is very grainy. Even under a 300W  halogen lamp. the picture quality is very poor. So. you can very well  forget about shooting under. say. fluorecent light. This is because. unlike  most of the VHSC or Hi8 camcorders. this camcorder requires a minimum of 4  lux of light for normal filming. Unless you are ready to invest on extra  light. this product is just not worth. For those who have extra light  .which can cost you a lot.. this camcorder generates just fabulous picture  quality.Another major disadvantage is lack of vendor choice. There are  about 56 major companies that make mini DV camcorders. While only Sony  makes digital8. So. if you buy digital8. you are stuck with Sony for ever  as no other camcorder can play you cassettes back. While mini DV is  industry standard. digital8 is Sonys proprietery.Another aspect that is  really bad is the battery life. It really sucks.One thing that is great  about this product is its sound quality. Almost like CD.,3,0,1304

AQQA2GTK78VI2,11,I thought I could use something like this to enhance the tiny pin hole mic on my tablet but this thing is actually worse.  When doing a test recording the pin hole mic on the tablet was 56 times as loud during playback and the fidelity of the sound was higher from the built in tablet mic.  About the only way to could get anything to even register was to speak directly into the holes on this mic from an inch away.,1,0,416

AQRKWQAW6U617,0,This is an absurd piece of junk. If you intend to limit its use to light local AM and FM broadcasts or pretending youre Flash Gordon it may  suffice. as long as you have a home palatial enough to accomodate it.  However. even with a decent long wire shortwave antenna you will need  either a lot of patience or very strong stations. because tuning the clumsy  slidestyle tuner is almost impossible to do with any degree of precision.  Even in an area of good radio reception this unit requires a quality  antenna for any. including the strongest. stations. especially on FM.  You  will need  and this is not a myabe. you will will will need  separate  antennas for FM and AM. and dont underestimate the headache this may  represent for you. not to mention the extra expense and rats nest of wires  needed just to bring static down to acceptable levels. And you wont get  away with just a cheap FM dipole antenna. the one I tried did nothing for  this gigantic colossus. and I had to use a powered FM antenna. .I had to  try three until I finally tuned out the static on FM.. The feel is mushy.  and in fact. the knobs arent even firmly set in place  whatever it is  that theyre are attached to moves around as you rotate the knobs. as if  they didnt finish putting the thing together inside the case. It surprised  me how shabbily made this fairly coollooking radio was when I first  started messing around with it. There are two things about this radio that  are unforgivable. NO HEADPHONE JACKS! Even as I write this I cant quite  believe it. and feel like one will appear. it will have been cleverly  hidden  but no matter how hard I look. how much credit I give them for  ingeniously disguising the thing  its not there. So if youre going to  use this bedside. just remember that it will always be a group activity.  and using it to record anything is ruled out for you. This is absolutely  beyond belief. considering that a jack would have added about four cents to  the cost  of  this behemoth. Equally irritating is that the line input for  using an auxiliary sound source  your cd walkman. say  is absolutely  terrible. You need to turn the unit way up just to hear what youve  attached. and then it comes through sounding like a damp toilet paper and  comb kazoo. I dont know how they could have possibly failed to do this  properly. but please do not buy this device if you expect to listen to your  cd player through it. The sound will kill you. The wooden case is nicely  made. but beware. it is much bigger than you might expect. about the size  of a mediumsize microwave oven. and it needs even more space than its  footprint alone would suggest. because two of the three speakers are on the  side. Bottom line  if you really like the way it looks and you dont mind  static on most stations. if you never intend to listen to an auxilliary  player through it. if its use as a shortwave is limited to maybe BBC and  other bigoutput stations. AND if you both never want to use headphones or  record anything. then this might. just might. do the job. Or you could get  a real radio nd use something else for decoration.,1,0,3129

AQSO7GLX9P2O7,0,I bought the Moleskine Booklight. excited about the fact that it was rechargeable via USB and. although I was aware a USD20 product was not going to last for years to come. I hoped it might at least get past 24 hours  no such luck.First of all. I turned the light on which subsequently did not turn off. I then decided to let the battery run itself out .no difficulty there. it only took approximately 1 hour.. The next day I tried to recharge the light and see if that would make a difference. Of course. I cant tell you the result of this because the light didnt recharge and was rendered absolutely useless!!Please do not waste your money on this worthless device.

I realized my old ISA soundcard was not going to fit into the new system.  Since I had spent a lot of money upgrading the computer already. the SB4740 seemed like a good option for a basic card.However. try and find support for this product is nearly impossible.  Windows 2000 professional drivers are non existant and Windows ME drivers do not seem all that stable.  For a basic product that has been around for years. youd expect better refinement.Finally. the audio quality is OK.  Pretty much what youd expect from a low end sound card.  Save yourself the trouble and move up to one of the better soundcards.,2,0,728
AR3HUTA2RFUL5,1113,This bag is great for keeping the trash together in one spot in the car.  Before I got it I would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks. which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor. This handles that pretty well. Couple cons though. it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly .make sure to check out the dimensions.. and it is not always easy to empty out.  The velcro does hold the bottom closed very well. just if it is really full. you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it.  This is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor. and I am very happy with the purchase.,4,1,672

I never thought id find the money for promedias but i got a pair of 4.1s on sale ...the difference is amazing. loudness u0026 clarity are the main reason I bought the klipsches.i can turn em up to deafening volumes u0026 they never distort.what I said about the bass is not really true .at least after hearing the 160 watt sub in my promedias!. the old altecs werked fine for everyday things like music u0026 games..sold em to neighbor u0026 hes in love with em. overall a good buy,4,1,546

AR84FMFYCQCWF,0,Ive had this for about 6 months now. This is the worst GPS Ive owned out of 4. It very seldom picks the best. or shortest route. It will let you put in multiple stops. but you only get info to the NEXT one. If you dont like a route and put in a VIA. guess what you only get info to the new VIA. how am I supposed to know if the new route is better? Routing is unbelievably slow. Ive had it take up to 30 minutes. then get it wrong. Adding things to the notes just puts it into one long line. How about putting a return so I can at least organize a little bit. Very cumbersome to use. its of little or no use for long range trip planning. I wouldnt recommend this to anybody at any price.,1,0,687

AR9UW6XFR97W7,0,With a full 300 watts of raw power. this system is a steal atUSD200 ! However you should ask yourself if you will use it fully. andif you would prefer to trade some of the power you dont use for other features like auto reverse. better designed remote. more channels. better fidelity. lower price...I think the CDC 3900 loses out on all of these and more in comparison to others in the USD150 price range. For a full comparison see the foll.For a quick look at competition in its price range and relative merits.1. Sharp CDBA 200  4 way speakers. 200 Watt and better sound quality though the CDBA 150 is nothing to sneeze at here...2. RCA RS2505  Superior Sound quality. 5 CD changer. Good design . Reliability of RCA...3. JVC MX J100  Loses out on ease of use. price and on Sound quality in my opinion. For the same USD150 you can do better with Sharp CDBA 1504. Sharp CDBA 150  Not a system for those who want an excellent remote or ease of use.it lacks autoreverse for casettes for example. It does have an outstanding sound quality .50 watt channel. but excellent sound fidelity.which I simply loved though. Same price as the JVC MXJ100. Downside. I did have problems with its antenna and had to get it replaced. Nevertheless for sheer outstanding sound quality I would rate this the best anyday at its USD150 price5. Sony CFD Z550  Sony reliability. ease of use. Downside . Theres no comparing the sound quality. This one is way down and would compare with lower grade systems from the Sharp stable actually for its USD150.6. Sharp CDC 3900  300 watts of power! Downside . older generation system. 2 channel. and USD200 to boot. Sound Fidelity is not upto the mark.7. Panasonic SCAK18  Awesome value for money with amazing features.pretty good sound fidelity. power.3 channel 50 watt per.. price and maintenance free reliability. Simply the most comfortable and intuitively easy to use.Just USD20 more than Sharp CDBA 150 at USD170Overall I liked Sharp CDBA 200 best in the USD150 .or so. price range in terms of only sound quality. Nevertheless while considering the overall purchase of the product. I chose the Panasonic SCAK18 system. It is simply the best value for money,3,0,2180
ARA94YWRAIAWG,6972,I bought this for christmas and I must say I am quite impressed! light enough for easy handling. good image quality. a lot of features for the low. low price.  LCD panel does drain the battery quite quickly but with  the eyepiece .black and white...aaarrgghh. you can get almost 8 solid hours  of filming in...more than enough...recommended for first or second  camcorder owners...,4,1,381
ARAUY7ODGQF9F,2526,This device did not work with anything.  We plugged it into two different computers and different software and it did not read the Iomega zip dics we had.  Our computer is 8.1 Microsoftware but the others were 7 or xp.  We would like our money back.,1,0,249
ARBBVSF3F9X7V,0,I bought this product in January.  It is now the end of April and the cable just stopped working.  If I play with the cable a bit.

ARBV8U9I8C1BK,0,Ive been using the PTouch PT80 for over a year and just ran out of tape.

ARC67WEGX5ZL0,44,The GE Super is just that SUPER! We have a home in the So Cal high desert and needed a radio that could get LA stations. With no external antenna we now can. with the GE. I will be adding an external antenna and Im sure it will be even better.We have a C.CRANE radio and it is a piece of trash! It could not get the LA stations clearly and could not hold them. After 5 years. the C CRANE is totally inoperative. The GE costs about 30% of the CCRANE and way out performs it. The CCRANE customer service likewise leaves MUCH to be desired.,4,1,537
ARFCS8DZ2W6IJ,66,This product did NOT match what I requested.  When I clicked on a research for a link of matching items for my battery. it said it was a replacement.  However. when I received the product. it absolutely did not fit in my unit.  I made an attempt per your suggestions to contact the supplier who was just unrealistic about working with me and the representative was quite arrogant with a nasty attitude.  This is a USD3.00 item that I paid over USD8.00 to have shipped and their only suggestion was to incur even more shipping to send it back and have another one shipped.  It is a USD3.00 item.  Absolutely ridiculous and I will not order anything having to do with electronics ever again from your site.,1,0,704

ARIZ46PEETTHV,2,Bought the nook for my daughter as a xmas gift. 2 months later. the charger breaks. 4 months after that. the screen gets a black line in it and it wont take a charge from the replacement charger i had to buy. I had a warranty on it so they send me  a replacement nook. but they send me a refurbished one. How does that work. I buy a new one and 6 months later I get a used one??? Now the refurbised one has lasted about 45 days and it has problems. Customer service is non existent and it is from some country in the middle East so you cant even understand them. I feel ripped off by Barnes and Noble.,1,0,601
ARJKFLF1SPNV1,0,This product fits over the ear well and seems to be okay.  I havent actually used it. so I cant rate its clarity right now. Clarity brings into question the stability of the phone this headset is used on.  So if the phone is good this headset should be okay.  At any rate. it was affordable comingin under USD10.00.,4,1,315
ARJOMZNEEOBH6,1,This cover works perfectly for my kindle.  I have no complaints.  Personally I get tired of people who pick apart an item that is being sold for far less then other models.  If you want all the features that come with a USD49.99 kindle cover then pay for that cover.  For the price I paid this cover does everything I need.  Glad I bought it!!,5,1,343

ARMYCTNFKFGX8,0,My fiance was in the market for a new ereader. It would be her first one. so I thought Id get her a nicer one that shed probably buy herself as a Christmas gift. After doing the research and speaking with owners of both the Nook HD and Kindle Fire. I went with the Nook. Then in conversation with my fiance. she basically said shed taking the gift cards that her students gave her to buy a Kindle .much to my dismay.. In her mind. she thought the basic model Kindle was better than the basic Nook. So I had to spoil the surprise so she wouldnt buy the Kindle. However. once she started using the Nook HD. she was blown away! Now she thanks me everyday because her reading .and internet browsing. experience is so much better than she had hoped for.,5,1,748
ARMYT82M9M8AJ,2026,Enjoy the nook for reading fairly simple to use once it is set up. and light and enjoyable to read. I started to read again after a long time without enjoying reading. The internet is fairly frustrating to use on the nook .for webbrowsing. for example. but that is not what I bought it for. The access to the Bu0026N store is awesome on the nook. though search for books. buy it. and it appears. That is awesome! However. I havent found near as many free books as they bragged about. I found several hundred. some duplicates. Where are the rest hiding? Battery life is fair. pretty good if you turn on airplane mode .allows days of reading a couple hours a day without charging.. but can die quickly .45 hours. in an area without wifi if you dont use airplane mode.Beware My nook recently did an auto update and deleted all the books. Apparenty this happens when you dont update often enough. and there are no cues for updating that I have seen. I saved the books to my computer so Im okay. except for the unnessesary hassle. but make sure you save the books elsewhere! I have to go reregister the nook. go through all the tutorial crap again. and then reload the books. A computer doesnt do this for an update. why should my nook? Very frustrating.,2,0,1249

ARPFEV2CEETWQ,12,I previously owned a Yamaha cassette deck before purchasing the DRW 55 from Denon.  I have made dozens of tapes for my friends and they all are amazed.

Each tape sounds outstanding!,5,1,360
ARPKCIJLNH6NK,23,I bought a new Canon i850 and wanted to use a printserver for it.  I originally bought the expensive Linksys PPSX1v2 print server but the performance was slow. no bidirectional support. and no linux support.  I returned it and bought the Netgear PS110.  What a big difference!  Its great!  Great performance and I can print with my linux box too!I found two problems.  1. Doesnt support the bidirectional functionality of the Canon i850.  2. When I first received the PS110. it was set to DHCP disabled.  So nothing could connect to it.  I found out that in order to MANUALLY set the IP. you have to connect the printserver directly to your NIC with a crossover cable. then set the ip using the u0026quotIPSetupu0026quot tool.,4,1,726
ARPUNOVF9MCAS,34,When I first got the player. I was very happy with it. the space was limited though. and file transfers were pretty low.  Then I upgraded to windows NT ... and the player is completely incompatible.  I tried emailing eiger labs. my first email went completely unread or responded too. and after my FOURTH email. I finally got a response saying that no. it did not support NT software. and they never plan to make compatible software ... all my further emails were ignored.  It is a good deal. and if you can get compatible software. its a great player ... but dont buy it to find you can completely not use it.  Also. the customer support has just been god awful. and offered no help or even apology.,1,0,700
ARPZYEXB3AQMO,22,I have been using rechargeable batteries for years .AAs only. so when we found out we were expecting a new addition to our family. we began purchasing other sized rechargeable batteries for all of the battery operated baby gear we were planning on using. They cost more initially be were were aiming to save more in the long run and reduce the waste created from used disposable batteries.We only have one rechargeable 9 volt battery that we use in our baby monitor. Its just a basic baby monitor. nothing fancy. Perhaps a rechargeable battery isnt the best battery to use for this particular application because I end up charging these batteries twice a week or so. I dont mind but sometimes it is a pain when the batteries die and hes just laid down for bed and Im trying to catch up on housework.Although I will say. that they do work just as well as regular batteries except that they must be charged frequently. I should also mention that I have never tried using disposable batteries in the monitor. they may drain just as fast?At any rate. these are good batteries. Ive always preferred Energizer over other brands. And I am really not disappointed with this battery either. Its all in perspective.,3,0,1205

ARQ945F4OIWVI,0,I tried this with a CDROM player that was not recognizing the CD. Initially it seemed to help a little bit. But the problem returned quite soon. So I tried using the cleaner again. I think three times in a row. The problem really never went away.,2,0,246

ARQKGQWZAKCXJ,1217,It worked as I had hoped it would. It cleaned my vcr heads really well. It was what I needed.,4,0,93
ARQOD677UE26C,0,Unfortunately. these earphones were not at all what I hoped for.  The sound quality was very tinny and had a very hollow sound.  I also did not like how there was a volume control on the case because it seemed to  contribute to the degraded sound quality.  In addition. the wires are oddly  placed and it is very cumbersome to have to carry around such a large case  all the time.  The earbuds themselves hurt my ears because the rubber rings  were too large and it felt like the metal speakercovering was ready to  fall off five minutes after opening the package.  I suggest you stay away  from these and stick with a nice pair of Sony earbuds or the Jensen earmuff  headphones.,2,0,679
ARQPFNUM3WD7N,55,The advertising for the RCA RC926 is deceptive. While it is described as a wireless modem jack. only after one opens the package and looks at the documentation does one discover that the modem speed is limited to 14.400  baud and more usually 9600 baud.  That was slow even 5 years ago now it is  virtually useless when most modems operate at 33600 or 56000 baud,2,0,362
ARRC6J54QXZH8,1642,This cd player is very decent for its price and it works alright so far. I happened to be disappointed in it when I received it in the mail. There was so many features that bring down the quality of the cd playeritself. It doesnt make a good car cd player unless you go on very long trips. Everytime you turn off the car. the cd player turns of its Electronic Shock Protection and you have to turn it on each time. Second it doesnt have a resume button. so you have to start your cd all over again. It lacks a place for a remote. Its just too much of a hassle. The only real good thing about it is maybe it has 40 sec esp. I wouldnt recommend that this a cd player as a thing to make a big deal about.,2,0,701

ARW2NTRCVWVOH,0,When I bought my Brother label maker. I bought two extra cartridges because I knew Id be using it alot.  Well its been almost six months. and I use the labeler every other day for something. and the cartridge that came in the labeler is still going strong.  Ive had no problems with running out or the labels not sticking.  The only problem I have had was when I try to take the paper backing off of the label...maybe Brother could devise an easier way for a guy with no fingernails to get the backing off easier.,4,1,513
ARXK6BFLM3XA8,6366,This is really a superb card for everyone who want to have all features in it and is not extremely demanding. If you need to play Quake 3 on 16001200 with immense depth and rendering etc. you probably wont be very pleased  with it. but if you are an average user who plays not too demanding games.  works with documents. watches TV. records some shows etc. youll find it  great. I must also state that I havent experienced any troubles .yet. in  over half a year. Works excellent for me. Highly recomended.,5,1,506
ARYMC1MBLCMI6,22,First let me start by saying this is great hardware and for the price compared to other tablets you cant beat it. But. it is insane that the first thing that pops up when first starting the nook is you HAVE TO HAVE A INTERNET CONNECTION. Then you have to set up a Bu0026N account and tell them what my hobby is. I understand that may get alittle picky but the Bu0026N os is horrible and the only reason they force you to stay connected to the internet is so they can send forced updates that will keep you from doing anything interresting with the tablet. This tablet has the potential to be great but it feels so limited. If they keep the software restricted they do better by downgrading the hardware. Because people expectations want be dissappointment. Holding a very capable and powerful device that essentially cant do much and want let you do nothing.,1,0,858

It deletes all static. but if the transmission is to quiet it will cut off the  transmission. You can disable this feature though when a message is  breaking up you hit the MON button and you can hear it clearly.  It has a  way to listen to two channels at once and it is very long range.  It also  has hookup for the type of earphones that have a microphone attached.,5,1,505

AS19IWGORT8IT,0,I have had this radio for about one month now. The speaker stopped working.  I had to buy an external speaker.

I continue to recommend it but I suggest purchasing an external speaker when you buy the radio.,4,1,355
AS1APOAKBRMM5,11,It would be nice if I could decode the latest digital video standards. but thats about it on complaints.  Considering the extremely reasonable price. this is simply the best receiver Ive ever had.It offers astonishingly clear sound .with my 5 ohm Magneplaners and ads sub.. plus plenty of inputs and outputs. and all around versatility.  Simply superb.  Even more importantly. whenever I want to do something. I just reach for the analogue buttons and dials and it happens.  No perusing the manual.  Try that with a Yamaha or Denon.Note. this receiver is no longer produced.  However. the current Nakamichi AV7 is almost identical .but with more video inputs.. and the AV8 and AV10 combine extra features .like a builtin crossover and DTS decoding. with the same amazing usability.The best receiverfamily going.  Get one. even if you already have a McIntosh or a Mark Levinson.  You may be very surprised by which one you actually use.,4,1,935
AS1IXRUV909AG,44,I have been wanting a DVD player for the longest time. but I was unsure on what to get.

If its time to get into the  21st century. this device is sure to surpass VHS.  If you dont have one. .  .. get one!

AS5ME0TB5TTN9,33,I am a big fan of Moleskine notebooks and I was even using them before they became a hype. So it would only be logical that I would have my kindle cover replaced by this one. This was a nobrainer.I tried it out last week but I was disappointed by the poor design and the untested usability.First. poor design. this cover is really too thick an fat  not only compared to the Moleskine notebook covers but most of all compared to the original Kindle cover. I would have expected an .even. more elegant design as the standard Kindle cover .which is a fine piece of art I now realize.. However. what I got instead was a plump. thick and heavy cover that may have the Moleskine imprint but nothing elegant.Second  and this is way I am returning this object. the wrappers that hold the kindle  especially the one in the top left hand corner block the devices onoff button. So you have to fiddle with both hands only to find that the wrapper holds the switch from returning to its original position. As a result my device was reset several times just because of the cover.In short. inelegant and untested .Return to sender... sorry!By the way. unlike all that is being told in the other comments I found the left positioning of the notes not to be a negative thing .unless you would be reading and writing simultaneously. which  as a man  I have no intention of doing.. From my experience the Moleskine notepad that is included is a good thing and it is in the right place... `left that is.,1,0,1483

AS6HY92W5YQH,12,I needed to move some old tapes to digital.  I bought this item because it got good reviews and it seemed a fair price at about USD160.  It works fine.  It would be nice if it had a volume control for the headphones.  It would be nice if it had a remote control.  It would be nice if the tape clack werent LOUD and slow.  It would be nice if it didnt have cheap switches on the lefthand side...  But all in all. its fine as is.Then a couple weeks after I bought this one. I saw a really nice tape deck at a thrift store.  It looked more expensive than this one. looked recent. had more hookup features in the back .including optical.. and looked like it had never been used.  For USD20 I could have got every feature here. except the pitch control. which is an afterthought feature anyway .its coarse and totally imprecise with no labeling. besides software will do the same thing for free..  I cannot speak for the technical quality of this unit or the one at the thrift store. but theres no evidence of any advancement between this one and one I bought a dozen years ago.  .by contrast. if you buy a cheap vcr today. it will probably be better. faster. quieter than an expensive one from just 6 years ago. as I learned firsthand recently.It occured to me that there are millions of practically unused tape decks in thrift stores everywhere no one needs them anymore.  The moral of this story. the internet is not everything!  Dont just buy because something got good ratings.,3,0,1477
AS6N7RH7K5HV9,11,Barnes u0026 Noble NOOK Color eBook TabletThis is one sweet little ereader tablet. It received great reviews from tech reviewers  CNET. WSJ. etc.. so I bought one a few months ago and free upgrades just keep making it better. Newspapers. magazines. and books all look great on this full color device. Watch Youtube videos. surf the net. listen to Pandora Radio. play Angry birds or choose from hundreds of other apps. If you have small children there are wonderful editions of full color childrens picture books. many of which are interactive.At USD199 .why does Amazon charge USD30 over the list price?. this full color ereader is a great tool that I carry with me everywhere.When I had a couple of questions about my Nookcolor. the Barnes u0026 Noble employees at my local store were very helpful. They also have a free class once a week for newbies.P.S. 12811  Barnes and Noble now has a full tablet version of this product at USD249. .half the price of an iPad. It comes loaded with apps for Netflix. Hulu Plus. etc. for movies. They started out with a minimum of apps but now have a couple thousand apps.,5,1,1109
AS7O5SPTBRP9D,55,This card works great in my Old Umax J700.Upgraded 300mhz G3..  It lets me play Q3 without having to buy a new computer.  I get 24 fps at 1024 with most of the goodies turned on. A great option for a Mac guy with an old  machine.,5,1,229
AS8AJX7D0G4AD,34,Have used for two weeks and headset works well. Head band is too long if you have a smallnormal sized head. expands to a very large head size. but not possible to make it smaller.  Not comfortable to wear on the head for long periods of time .several hours.. I leave the headset around my neck between calls. and that is perfectly comfortable for 23 hours of phone calls per day. Volume good. no complaints on my voice quality from callers on other end. Boom mic has good range of motion. can swing easily out of the way while on long holds. TIP. keep mic directly in front of mouth .not off to side. for best results.,3,0,618
AS8ITRI9K262S,44,I want to represent the view of a medical student and maybe get some answers.  As doctors. the PDA is the future of fast reference and palmpilot is the gold standard. but which to buy? I have borrowed a Palm V for one  week and I have the opputunity to buy it used for a good price.  I love its  style.  It cant be beat.  However I am conflicted about whether or not I  need the additional memory of the 8 MG of the VX. I can think of 5 more  programs .med dictionary. internal medicine manual. PDR. etc. which I would  like to download. one of which is 4 MGs .Merc manual.alone.  I only have  255 K left.  I am a new user of the V. but I dont want to be impulsive and  by a V when I NEED a Vx for my career.  But technology is changing so fast  and possibly this is good for a student and I will get a new one in a  couple years when the standard will be the dream machine of today for that  same USD400 of the Vx.  I have yet to make a decision...price or memory .I am  a poor student..,4,1,988
AS9LCDE8R8GXD,1119,I usually go with brands like Panasonic or Sony but these tapes were advertised as high grade so I took a chance.  Unfortunately. the sound quality is not very good.  I can hear a continual hissing noise and the words are a little garbled.,3,0,239
ASAE723AV7MYO,0,these work for just about anything that you might need them for.  there are only six in the package so you dont get very many.,4,1,126
ASAX9K2T9R108,0,I got my data cable in the mail yesterday and when I plugged my phone into my macbook iPhoto automatically came up and asked if I wanted to import all my mobile pictures. which I did.  A folder also pops up on my desktop to drop MP3s from my computer to put on my phone.  I can also delete MP3s that are on my phone if I want.  The only reason I do not give this product 5 stars is because I cannot edit my contacts through my computer.  It would be really nice to add phone numbers and email addresses to my phone from my computer because I type much faster on my big keyboard.  Maybe there is a way that I just dont know about.,4,1,629
ASB2KK5C22P6H,0,Its designed for ATu0026ampT and Lucent cordless phones. But it also works great on VTech and other phones. However. it is NOT working on Motorola FR50 twoway radio. even they are using the same 2.5mm jacks. FR50 uses  reversed connectors for mic and speaker. so this headset simply wont work.  unless you want to modify it or use a converter. How do I know this? I just  ordered two of them and wished I could use them on my FR50 radios.Also.  all computers sound cards Ive seen are using 3.5mm jacks. and they have  seperate mic jack and .stereo. speaker jack. I just cannot see how it can  fit in computers.,5,1,610
ASB2KK5C22P6H,24,Its surprise to see they put 10100 fast PCI cards in this low price package. Unlike other entry level kits. everything are well packed in this box.The only thing I think they can do better is adding internet sharing  information.I already have a home network setup. so I just installed one  card in this package to test if it is working. It had problems talking to  other brand network cards after installation. however. after several tries  in network configuration. it works. But. my computer became very slow at  bootup. Dont know if it is setupdrivers problem or it is conflicted  with the original 3Com card.,4,1,613
ASBBZH5USMP4W,11,This may be a good product. I dont know. because I brought used ones and they did not work. I will be buying new from now on.,1,0,125
ASBJBTJ22ZZNA,0,We use 9v rechargable batteries at our church.  These will only last 2 hours in a wireless microphone.  They will barely last 2 hours in our wireless audio packs .ear buds. and when I use them for my electric bass wireless transmitter device they barely get through 30 minutes of use per charge.  Since we have three services and practice that morning as well. these batteries do not cut it.We found these Digimate 280mAh rechargeable 9vs that work much better... we can get two complete weekends from one charge on these... plus. they were only USD5 each.,1,0,556

ASCG7DCWGY3PR,0,Good for reading if you buy the books from Barnes and noble. I found d it to be very tedious to borrow books on this device.,2,0,124
ASCLBK90XSL2P,12,I used a crosspad my last year of law school.  Its great for taking notes on the fly in class. and for me it got me to download and correct the OCR translation each night.  This allowed me to embellish my notes because the lecture was still fresh in my head from the afternoon.  As a consequence of this little device. my outlines and other study aids were based more on class notes than textbooks.  The result was much better test scores.This is far from a perfect device. but with a little practice it becomes a very handy aid for archiving and formalizing your class notes for exams.  It is also a great way to archive extemporaneous notes.Biggest cons.OCR is not particularly accurate.Pen refills have little ink and are expensive.,4,1,735
ASCY8GMJRN3F5,22,I bought this for a new engineer that wanted to use an old AT mechanical keyboard instead of the plastic MK Logitech that I bought for him. He brought the keyboard from home. That is his dedication and love for the old style non made in china mechanical keyboards from the old school days. Actually I dont know if that keyboard is made in china or not. There is not even a windows key on it ! I give him mad nerd respect for even having that. I like the old style keyboards but the way I type it doesnt matter to me. Windows key is helpful though *shrugs*,5,1,555
ASD0AQ6L4O0UD,23,This isnt any worldbeater. but if you just want to take some vain pictures of yourself and send the odd vmail  which is all I do  this camera should be adequate.  If youre looking for a video conferencing beastie. look elsewhere.The model I have is. evidently. the 33L4890. instead of the 89.  I cant imagine theres much difference  whichever one of IBMs cameras you pick. you wont get much support from Big Blue its outsourced to the hodgepodge of hardware and software developers who contributed to the package.If you dont expect too much. youll be happy.  If you need the damn thing to do as you tell it. spend more money.,3,0,625
ASDEYBRH10TFF,2,I honestly wish I had never come across this. The Nook itself was a gift .thank goodness. but Ive pored tons of into it in the form of cases. apps. books and magazine subscriptions. Now I am trying to find a place that will give me more than USD20 for the parts. A sampling of the problems with the Nook Color.1. The screen is backlit and incredibly bright. Even on the dimmest setting. I am rubbing my eyes within twenty minutes. I cant read this for extended periods without getting a migraine.2. One of the major appeals of an Ebook for me was cheaper books. as there are obviously significantly decreased costs of production. Titles on the Nook are extremely expensive. I compared it to Kindle prices. and the Nooks were always noticeably more expensive. The cases are pure highway robbery .USD35 for a case in store..3. Customer service. They brag one of the main advantages of Nook over Kindle is the customer service. This is false. The people working the Nook booth in my local Bu0026N have never been too helpful. and I dont like having to drive 15 minutes to a store to ask a basic question. However. whenever I call. there is a long wait time and I never can communicate well with the person on the other end.4. Deceptive advertising. The Barnesu0026Noble ad campaigns heavily feature the fact that the Nook Color and HD can play movies. marketing is an alternative to Kindle Fire. The Kindle can download almost any movie from Amazon Instant and stream anytime and anywhere without taking up much memory. Nook can sometimes load Netflix when you had an excellent Wifi connection. When I do have an excellent Wifi connection .like at home. I am going to watch movies on my TV or laptop. not Ereader. The only times I would want to watch movies on my Ereader are say. on vacation or on a long bus ride... when I do not have an excellent Wifi connection. The feature is deceptive and pointless.5. The final straw for me was the magazine system. I have used only a fraction of my Nooks memory. but to save space. the Nook automatically deletes my old magazine issues. If I want to access them again. I have to redownload them. a slow and painstaking process. And then. within a day. Nook has deleted them all again. When I asked Nook support about this .if I bought those magazines I should have the right to do with them what Id like. there was practically no response.THIS IS AMAZON. BUY A KINDLE.,1,0,2407
ASDFYMJ1MTPE7,0,I have used this wireless phone jack system to connect a DirecTV receiver for over 18 months .and for three months. a Tivo. without a problem.  The stations are about 20 feet apart with a wall and furniture in between. but I have not had connectivity issues.  I have two wireless networks .b and g.in the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned.  That said. my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a 15 ft. lineofsight installation with no other wireless networks. so the system seems to be somewhat picky.,4,1,612
ASEL8JCT9PU2T,1112,This is a good mouse at a good price.  The only thing that keeps it from being a great mouse is that the scroll wheels are totally smooth.  This makes changing weapons in some games difficult.,4,0,192
ASFQ9115QA9PP,22,first off. I am mechanically inclined. and this looked ok when I got it. however when I mounted it to the studnot a big problemit became slowly obvious that the middle joint was a bit wonky. I followed the instructions all the way and when the tv was mounted and I thought it might work the middle part did not hold and my flatscreen went down. hit the wall and brokejust goes to show that you cant trust product ratings on Amazon. and its more cheaply made defective garbage from china.,1,0,487
ASFU8QACTG9IR,2130,I am a professional online therapist and I do phone consultations all day. I have to have two things. a good phone and a good pair of headsets. I have been through so many it would make your head spin! I recommend ATu0026ampTs headset. which I found at my local Target store. This pair had very poor sound quality... and I heard a slight echo of my own voice when speaking of them. Not something I would reccomend. Good luck!,1,0,425
ASGUKBK6IB2SG,1919,This year for Christmas I thought it was important to buy a reader for my grandchildren.  We usually have a smaller limit since we have seven grandchildren.  Having been a teacher. I know how important reading is so felt this was an important product.  One of the grandsons has physical problem so cant carry heavy books.  this will allow him to download the book and not carry five books weighing over fifty pounds.  Great product for a good price.,5,1,449
ASH6BPOHY77WO,35,The Jenson headphone is high quality economicalal investment that makes a great upgrade for the inferior ones that comes with every music player.  It handles bass very well. is comfortable. and has a generousely lenghted cord.  Their is also a handy volume control located about 2 feet down from the earpiece that has an onoff switch as well.  The overthehead piece is made of soft robber that dosent pull at your hair and bends nicely.  The only downside. I feel. is the fact that the earpieces often do not fit copmpletely adjecent to the ear robbing you of some potencial volume.  Other than that. the Jenson JM10 Headphone is the best bangforthebuck on the market.,4,1,668
ASHJAZC9OA9NS,33,Reception is outstanding.  Easy to set up stations.  Timed onoff is automatic. Easy to read display. Great sound for a mono speaker.  Battery life is amazing.  Worth the price.  I would happily repeat the purchase if I manage to wreck this radio.Update.  The TV function of this radio is not functional with the digital TV change over.,5,1,335
ASHW5FOYAHUPW,22,We have had our JVC VCR for 1.5 yrs.  Three weeks ago. the power just completely blew out.  Since we spent a little more for what we thought was a good VCR. we took it for repair.  The repair man just called me to say  that JVC has parts to repair our VCR on backorder for 2 months. and this is  a sign to him that it has serious problems.  He also said we spent  aboutUSD280 for a USD100 VCR.  So needless to say. we are feeling a bit ripped  off.,1,0,448
ASID6LAR9A3VD,724,Not only is RCA one of the best companies to buy from but this product  really shows it! With an Fm tuner.hard to find on portables. and a 45  second antiskip. Im surprised it hasnt sold out yet. I dont know about  you but I think Im gonna buy another one as a gift. One particular reason  I love this is because of the low price. How many times daily do you see  somethin like this for only 80 bucks? Not very often. I take the bus a lot  and this is perfect for those times you get forced to sit in the back where  the bus does nothing but go up and down for hours and it makes your player  skip every 5 seconds. well this one has no problem with that as it can  store 45 seconds of the song. This is a necessity for everyone and I  suggest you buy this item asap.,5,1,766
ASIG7RLMLKW85,33,I am using the visor in my 2008 Toyota Corolla and. after some minor adjusting. it fits perfectly.  I dont use the vanity mirror all that much but it is accessible as promised.,5,0,176
ASITHBKGXQA65,22,Arrived quickly and works well. I use it in my 1997 Ford Pickup without problem. The extra bass added by the booster toggle is a nice addition. The only problem is if you have a reversible tape deck. it will try to reverse every now and again. other than that works perfectly,4,1,275
ASKZV851SZPZ3,0,After going through 5 Simple Touch with Glowlight I finally decided to try this model. it arrived with the same torn screen as the old ones.

ASLUAK1HIT6YO,22,I purchased my BC245XLT with the idea of being able to take advantage of using Unidens Smartscanner Technology and downloading my frequencies based on my area code.  It seems that Uniden has dropped this feature as of February 2002 and according to one of their tech support people. have no intention of bringing this service back.  So. if you can find the list of frequencies and then have the time to set each one. have at it.  Personally. I would pick another manufacturer that advertises and stands behind their products features.,1,0,534

ASNI5BU914GO1,7,Works great with an external antenna like the firestick!  did some testing with the included antenna and it works like a FRMS. Volume may be a little low for some.Lots of neat features. and a nice package.,4,1,205
ASOQKF9ZNJ1YO,0,Im not a serious CB user .I use ham and GMRS. mostly. but this is pretty handy to stick in the pickup when Im pulling the travel trailer for a road trip or camping. Range was about what youd expect .without skip about the best you can get on CB is around 4 5 miles with a decent antenna. with a 4 ft. antenna. Dont be too disappointed with radio activity CB isnt what it used to be. what youll mostly get is truck drivers if youre on the freeway. and just about nothing anyplace else. although I did pick up a couple of drug dealers conversing in Spanish a few days ago. Recommended if your intention is to have it around in your vehicle for road info..,4,1,653
ASOQROO9OD3XG,0,I love moleskine products. so I may be slightly biased. but...I used my Kindle for reading academic papers .PDF. and pleasure books. This cover seemed to offer the perfect option. as I need to take notes while I read.It is true. the pocket for the notepad is poorly designed. and the notepad will flop over. It is also true that the design is for a lefty. which is really silly and inconvenient... BUT.I took an exacto knife and cut a slit through the bottom of the pocket. just above the stiching. just slightly longer than the width of the notepad. I then lined the edges of the cut with a tiny bit of masking tape .just to keep it from ripping.. I then flipped the DX over. and voila. a righty notepad. and the notepad doesnt flop over.Should I have to do this? No. However. I found it worth the price for a very classy feeling. functional product that will protect my Kindle without damaging it .as some of the Amazon products are purported to do..Cheers.,4,1,959
ASQLVUUWL6RER,44,I purchased this product last year for my husbands birthday and we have had nothing but trouble ever since.  When we first set it up we used it a couple of times and it stopped working.  My husband had to send it back to RCA to get it replaced at least twice before he complained that he didnt think it was packaged properly.  It finally came packaged properly and worked. for about 6 months.  2 weeks ago it completely stopped in the middle of a movie and hasnt worked since.  Youve got to be kidding me.This is the biggest waste of money and time ever!!  Its a total disgrace.,1,0,578
ASQYA3YRP9MF9,0,I was torn between getting this and the standard kindle case..So far i dont regret buying it!The case is pure moleskine asthetics. Simple and very classic. closed it looks exactly like a moleskine journal. Build quality is top notch. the seams and stitching have all held up very well and look sturdy. It folds over well for one handed holding. However if you have the included paper pad inserted it can be a bit unwieldy. especially on the move. Since i usually read on the bus. I usually am doing it one handed. I ended up taking out the books in order to cut down on alot of the weight and the awkwardness of having a notepad hanging off the back while i read.The issue alot of people are having is the fact you cant switch which side holds the Kindle and which side holds the note paper. For a lefty like me. the setup does work. Though i can see why righties dont like it!,4,1,877
ASRMT0X0G4UU2,0,Needed a short cord to reduce clutter between my router and a switch.  Wanted a reliable brand name .Belkin. cord with quality connectors.  This one looks well built. Only shortcoming is that it is cat 5e .350 speed. vs cat 6 .500 speed..  Didnt see a 3 foot one in Cat 6 but the price for the Cat 5e was very fair.,4,1,315

ASSVNQDLUBR54,22,I wanted to buy a headset with a swivel boom microphone so I could use my phone and remain hands free while driving.working in my office or simple going outside to take the dogs for a walk.This device gives me all that I wanted and a bit more. It is easy to use. the swivel boom microphone allows me to adjust it to a comfortable position while speaking.I recommend a headset like this one to anyone interested in having a completely hands free operation.The only suggestion I want to offer is make sure to get the correct size jack for what ever you use it with. I had to find an adapter for mine. but that was easy too.Lots of luck. have fun and enjoy a great product,4,1,669
AST6DZYSZO4UI,1,I got this to try to improve on the length of time that one charged battery will keep my DeLorme GPSr going.  The original one. at best. only lasted about 2 12 hours. not nearly enough for a day of geocaching.  This replacement one lasts closer to 4. much better. and I got 2 batteries and switch them out.  The down side is that the PN40 has trouble telling when the battery is close to dead. and just shuts down suddenly. somewhat disconcerting.  Otherwise it is working well and my PN40 doesnt seem any the worse for it.,4,1,523
AST7UNIXVOAVA,11,I have to assume that the lipsynch problem referred to inearlier reviews must have been taken care of. because I haventencountered the slightest problem. The video quality is simply astonishing  I won my wife over by doing a direct comparison with the laserdisc and DVD versions of u0026quotGone With the Windu0026quot  she is 100% sold now! Theres enough flexibility that you can upgrade to a componentvideocapable TV if you dont have one now Im using the Svideo output and THAT blows me away.  The remote has EXCELLENT human factors engineering  I have no trouble using it in a dimlylit room for the usual functions .pause. slow forwardbackwards. fast. etc.. plus some HANDY features like u0026quotHow much time is left on the movie?u0026quot Menu access is simple and intuitive. too  no teenytiny pixiesized buttons to feel around for. Full 5.1 outputs and DTSDolby Digital if you can use them and a host of options for the twothree speaker folks. Really. this has everything you could ask for in a player in this price range  I dont know who selected the Toshiba as Amazons pick. but THIS is REALLY the one you want!,5,1,1120
ASWCLDH4MRFDU,1717,Its already a great product. I cant live without it.  Although I already upgraded it to 8MB. more memory is always good. Colour will be great too! Am I expecting too much?,4,0,171
ASWZMHHTJIU76,23,case is good for protecting your iPod but you have to notch out the blue plastic piece with a scalpel to insert the headphone cable fully. and you have to fish the headphone wire through the hole in the bottom of the carry case thingee before you can snap the iPod into the case and then it faces your body and you cant adjust the songs. etc. while you are working out because the wire is run through the case and the iPod is facing your body. just a pain to use unless you are gonna put it on and leave it. Also. the plastic that covers the touchscreen is way too soft and scratches very easily.,3,0,596
ASY1ZIBPP6OI5,0,Those batteries comes on plastic bag package. not as original picture package. but work perfectly for my tv control. worth the price.,4,1,133
ASY25YMTIC2A9,0,I bought this keyboard for a network server figuring that I would save a few bucks since it wouldnt be used much. There are. however. two main problems with it.1. The keyboard seems incompatible with any monitor AB switches. Ive tried several. but they all lock the keyboard up. which forces me to unplug the keyboard and plug it back in for it to work.2. The control and shift keys stick. They arent actually stuck down. but they often act as if theyre stuck. To cure it. I have to press both shift buttons or both control buttons.This keyboard. in my opinion. isnt worth the money for what I use it for and itll be replaced as soon as possible.,2,0,646
ASYIVKEMXRO5L,55,Easy to read. use. great for laying against leg as it does not slip so hands and arms are more relaxed. Two different options for turning pages as one reads is very useful. The changing of the pages .on all ereaders. must be gotten use to. but not a bad negative.Excellent way to approach a more green world. read old. new books. and enjoy life.,5,1,345

AT07NFRRVAC2S,12,Given the short lifespan of digital goods these days. I was amazed to find this antique still listed on Amazon. I dont remember how long I have had mine. but I know it has been at least 10 years if not 15. Being of average clumsiness. I have accidentally dropped .even dropkicked. it more times than I care to remember. yet the durn thing still works. The FM. that is the AM went out on it several years ago .that must be what I hear rattling around inside when I shake it.... but I hardly ever listen to AM. so no big loss.The reception on the SRFM32 is decent. not superlative. I mainly listen to two NPR stations located within 6 miles of my neighborhood. so reception is not a huge concern for me. but that is the reason I only give it 4 stars. On the other hand. I bought a little portable Grundig pocket radio about 34 years ago. thinking the reception would be better .a Grundig. after all..... but my antique Sony actually works better. The Grundig sits on a shelf. while I use the Sony on my walks every day of every week. morning and afternoon.Some other reviewers complain about short battery life. I use rechargeable NiMH batteries. and they last me about a week or two between charges .=14 to 28 hours.. I just carry a spare pair of AAAs in my pocket problem solved.To sum up. on the plus side. very portable. incredibly durable. decent enough reception. decent battery life. super easy to program. and best of all. excellently designed rubberized buttons than can easily be distinguished by feel so that I can change stations .etc.. without taking it out of my pocket. On the down side. reception could be better. and no doubt battery life could be better as well. Altogether. a decent .and longlasting. value.,4,1,1724
AT09WGFUM934H,33,It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat. compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesnt run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubIt does the job adequately as its designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using .even though it cools off. because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait. but not so much when charging. I guess its better to have it at the plug.,3,0,611
AT0WXV5X94EDY,0,I had read the negative reviews that complained of this product ceasing to work shortly after receiving it. but figured I would roll the dice because the price was so good and I knew I could return it if it didnt work.  Well folks. it didnt.  It played for about 30 seconds and then quit.  If I turned it off and then turned it back on. it would play for about five seconds before quitting.  If I left it off for a long time. it would return to playing for 30 seconds before quitting.  Really weird.  I cant imagine what would make it do this.  Regardless. Ive returned it to Amazon. who also paid for the shipping.I gave it two stars because it sounded fine while it worked.  If you get lucky and get one that works. you will probably like this product.  But if I were Amazon. Id drop it to avoid all of the additional shipping charges for returns.,2,0,849
AT1KR4G300HJG,23,This product worked fine for the first five months. All of a sudden. this product reset the combination lock by itself. I really wish I had read the reviews for this product because now I have to deal with removing it from my computer. I contacted Targus tech support. The person told me that he would send instructions on how to remove the lock at the end of the session. I asked how long it would take to remove the lock. and he said it should take a few minutes at most. I opened the document he sent afterwards. which said  very confidential  at the top. In the document. it basically said try every single combination or use a hacksaw .unrecommended.. The average time suggested is 45 minutes. First of all. those are the most common sense ways to break the lockI hardly needed Targus to send me those instructions. And it does not only take a few minutes. I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with Targus.,1,0,917
AT2BYFEVLVITT,0,I got to the point in my cd collection that i had so many cd jewel cases i didnt know what to do with them. These Caselogic binders are the perfect answer. The amount of space you save is enormous. plus. how else could you  transport 200 cds around. you would need a big box if you still kept them  in a jewel case. I have the leather covering instead of the Koskin. I think  it looks a bit better. Either way though. if you have a lot of cds this is  the best binder out there.,5,1,478
AT2BYFEVLVITT,3335,With my setup I have my printer and a zip drive running off the same cable. and since I bought this Belkin cable I havent had any problems. It is also very easy to screw and unscrew onto the computer as it has  different knobs than the standard printer cable.,5,1,259
AT3A15L9RB2FM,46,I wanted a way to input video from my camera. so I thought it would be great to get TV on the computer as well.  I ended up with what I paid for.  There are more expensive cards I could have gotten. but I thought ATI would  be quality.  What I found was a very buggy software package.  On my system.  a Dell p450 with a Diamond Viper 3d card. it crashes if you use the wrong  setting.  That means I cant use it the way it was designed to work.  I  have work arounds and functions that I avoid.  I would never recommend this  card to anyone and i look forward to a software update.,2,0,580
AT3AUSP65I7I3,811,I can not get this to hook up to my computer. which has windows 8 on it  thinking its not compatible but did not receive any info with the item to instruct how to return to sender. Final sale?,2,0,192
AT42TLFYDRZAK,0,This is a great little system. and I wouldve given it 4 stars. But I have to throw it out. A power surge killed the power transformer. and the part is no longer available. Sad when a company doesnt support its products.,1,0,219
AT4AV7XIQDKQP,0,This is a basic lowend sound card. It puts out pretty good sound for most things you do on your computer. It comes with some ok software and all the cables to connect to your cdrom drive so you can rip your cds directly from the cdrom. The drivers are included for all windows including xp.Why you wouldnt want this cardIf you are a gamer or listen to high quality mp3 .over 128 bitrate.. 128 or less will sound fine with this cardI dont understand people having driver support because creative labs is the biggest sound card company on the market and one thing you will not have to worry about is driver support with any current or future versions of windows,3,0,659
AT4DDC1ZW4ZIJ,89,This radio has very poor reception where my other radios have great reception. Even my favorite strong signal talk show station came in as a spanish language station. Very disappoining for a Sony product.,1,0,204
AT4KBG3R728L8,33,With a box of over 20 Cat 5 cables I have no idea why I bought this. I must have been drunk. Also claiming a 3foot cord as Snagless is a bit overboard. but those Marketing Execs really know what they are doing at Belkin.,3,0,220
AT4Q85TN8PPWM,3,This unit really lends itself to synthesizerbased music. but forget about listening happily to classical music. including opera.  The brass section sounds tinny and the strings hollow. and no matter what equalizer setting I  put it on. nothing helps.  Fortunately. my eclectic tastes in music leave  me plenty of satisfactory options. but classical CDs truly sound better on  my Magnavox boombox than on this thing.  It does. however. look nice  on a shelf. plus youre not commited to the speakers since you can plug  other kinds in. unlike some minisystems.,3,0,558
AT54Q2ERA4PBR,6468,It is easy to clean exposed magnetic tape cassette heads. but more difficult to clean performancedegrading dirt and grease from the tapepath capstan. rollers and other parts hidden from view and accessed only by tedious removal of protective panels and doors.  This Maxell cleaner removes dirt and grease from the head and all the parts mounted along the entire tape path without any need to remove protective panels and doors.  The Maxell cleaner takes the shape of a standard tape cassette with the usual tape replaced by the gears. felt blocks and other parts needed to convert a tape cassette into a cleaner.  The cleaning fluid and instructions included make it easy to use.,4,1,679
AT5MEB6KB578W,11,I bought it for my grandson and he loves it! I little scarry putting my credit card in it to purchase. but the item itself is great,4,1,131
AT6P6QWC7ZSL6,0,I had previously owned a Teac dual casset playerrecorder for twenty years and was very satisfied with it. When it finally broke I decided to purchase another. Upon reciept of the new recorder I proceeded to try all functions of the machine. When I tried to record from a CD or another casset the results was garbled noise. Im sure that this was not the norm for Teac equipment.but I returned the merchandise and ordered the more expensive Denon. Hopefully this recorder will last far more than twenty years.,1,0,507
AT70NVPAMJMTX,0,I have two of these and I am pleased with their performance. both audio and video. overall. The discs I use for reference are Anchor Bays u0026quotThe Black Holeu0026quot for video .a great transfer and a really good  way to see variations in light and dark on the screen. and u0026quotThe  Matrixu0026quot for audio .very nice. dynamic AC3 sound track.. The only  thing that tarnishes these units is the fact that the remotes have buttons  that ARE ALL THE SAME SIZE .get a clue remote designers. we need remotes  that you can operate in a closet blindfolded. and it doesnt light up in  the dark. Other than that. no problems so far in two months.,4,1,648
AT8CNH2A79KOT,11,I got mine at Radio Shack. and its been a great addition to the monitoring station.  I also had no problems with this portable. FM is a plus. but its good for DXing FM anyways without RDS.  The longwave coverage is excellent and beats my other portables in the DX competition for LW DXing. I can receive alot more NDB in the 144 to 353 kHz range with this portable than any other radio I have owned.  MW DXing has been easy with this radio. so is the selectivity of the AM bands.  Shortwave is great and fun to listen to. and also the sensitivity. selectivity has been no problem for this portable even on the batteries since last year hurricane called Isabel.,4,1,660
AT8PWYGIPQHMG,35,This particular cleaner doesnt really do the job that it previously did on my good old VCRs.  I need to change to DVRs!,4,1,119
ATAS1JU2SXBL4,0,These mics are pretty legit.Speaker Quality.The speaker quality is pretty good just as long the user on the other end does their part in speaking into the mic correctly.  I have the MR350R waterproof version and the remote speaker is pretty close to the quality of the handhelds speaker.  The remote speaker does have a bit more treble to it but not bad enough to where its a problem.Durability.The plastic housing isnt the thickest. but thick enough to where it is durable enough for normal use unlike the remote mics for law enforcement.  The feels very sturdy and durable.  Only gripe about the cord is that it is quite short and the coil makes it tight from waist to lapel.  Some may want this but if it werent as tight and uncoiled easier then it would probably be better.!!!UPDATE!!!I used this remote speaker mic for 5 days while snowboarding.  I wore it on the strap of the backpack where it was exposed to snow and cold constantly.  Im not the best snowboarder so I was in the snow all over the place.  The mic isnt labeled as water proof or even weather resistant but it definitely got wet and still works like a charm.  The clip was strong enough and never fell off of the strap even after all of my spills.  I love this thing and want to use it every chance I get.,5,1,1276
ATB1JL6WM9U7E,22,I just got this Koss cd player in the mail. and it works as specified.  It sounds good. everything seems to be working. and its definitely worth the price. You wont find a decent brand cd player with 40 sec AS and a car kit  for this cheap anywhere.  As far as aesthetics goes. it looks plain. which  is how it should be.,4,1,321
ATBIBEK49IO35,0,THE QUALITY HAS GONE WAY DOWN. I HAVE LITERLY BOUGHT HUNDREDS OF THESE VCR TAPES. THE LAST FEW PURCHASHES HAVE HAD PROBLEMS OF PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY. IT MAY BE THE TOSHEBA RECODER I BOUGHT BECAUSE .,2,0,202
ATBM0A2GBOUR7,1,Allsop was looking out for the customer in the design of this mini disc storage tower.  Visible in the picture are slots in the sides of the tower.  Each tower comes with two connectors that join two towers together at the  top and bottom. creating a third 25disc storage area between them.  So.  each tower added creates storage for 50 more discs. up to the width of your  shelf.  One tower is 11.5u0026quot29cm tall and 4.5u0026quot11.5cm wide the  width of two connected towers .75 discs. is 11.5u0026quot29cm.,4,1,513
ATBM0A2GBOUR7,3131,Im still shopping for a portable MD player. and appreciate all the reviews here.  I own an AIWA shelf 3CD5MDTuner recorder that was available here last year. and with which I am totally satisfied.  If you can afford it. I HIGHLY recommend the SONY MDX65 MD changer for your car.  It requires a compatible SONY indash unit to control the changer. and you  can select from radio. radiocassette. and radioCD. The changer is in my  glove box and requiring no magazine. five MDs may be changed while a sixth  is playing.,2,0,515
ATD9PZNLQT7ZX,118,Bought this cable to connect my iMac with an older Epson 740i printer.  Works like a dream. and the colors match my equipment nicely as well.,5,0,141
ATDD5TT13QIW8,0,I inserted the card into my phone and it works well. no problems with anything. If you are looking to expand your storage on your smartphone. I recommend this card.,4,1,164
ATEIBCFNKWRKX,0,I got the product from CompUSA storefront. The shipment was prompt and I am happy with the overall quality of the product. The only problem that I had was with the broken case.,4,1,176
ATERVYVS1YUYY,0,product arrived with one knob broken completely off and the second knob broke during the very first road trip. other than that the unit appears to work well.,3,0,157
ATEUCBITZJ5XO,2,I purchased for my wife as a gift and she loves it. Product met all of her needs and  she loves being able to just select a book and download it without any hassle. Battery lasts a good amount of time and I can now sleep at night without a flashlight beaming in my face on accident!,5,1,282
ATF5AXWORHQMA,23,I have the A310 and am looking to replace it after about 18 months.  It skips periodically and freezes up.  More often than not when I put a new disc in it tells me its the wrong format.  The Panasonic rep insists I  have bad DVDs.  Cant explain why they play on my computer DVD and not the  Panasonic. though.  Panasonic is not on my list for a replacement.  Sad.  Like many others I used to be a PanasonicMatsushita fan.  At least I can  still use it as a singledisc CD player....,1,0,482
ATF9GIT9E3X5S,712,Between this and other popular competitors there isnt a lot of difference in hardware.  The software and usability is noticeably different though. and thats where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I havent heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones Ive heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there. but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury. sideloading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device .this will void the warranty..  I didnt expect sideloading to be a given really. but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot. which many people may not ever use. is in a pretty odd spot.  Its not really hard to pry back the cover but since youre working with a microSD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasnt annoying. it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isnt really techsavvy it isnt obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a gridlike app drawer. theres little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around. to and from the dock. but appsbooks dont lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just wont stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app. which is a nice app. but I find the contrast displeasing. further emphasizing this is a tablet with ereader functions .or vice versa maybe..  Basically the cohesion isnt there and you start to wonder. with all of the restrictions. why you didnt just get a regular tablet.I still havent rooted my wifes tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough shell let me do it.  Otherwise. if youre not planning to root the NOOK. beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a dealbreaker.  This is an ereader FIRST and a tablet SECOND.  If youre satisfied with its ereader capabilities Im sure youll be happy with this device.,3,0,2516
ATFLE8WVPLZZC,67,The speakers are full of static and intermittant even when close to the transmitter. rendering them worthless. Also. they require 16 batteries. which is not disclosed. One could buy 2 expensive aC adapters. but then you may as well use wired speakers.,1,0,251
ATFUW0OK24QYU,5656,Good system. little bit outdate in buttons. but is good if you dont want throw away you old tapes. So far. is the best value USDUSD system in the market for the money.,4,0,167
ATFV96W3ONAC0,88,I bought this for my daughters Tablet...worked well! Cheap and reliable! Looking to save some money then you are headed in the right direction with this purchase.,4,1,162
ATG0QL3DXMIR0,0,This is a good GPS for navigating a straight line between two points. but not much else.This GPS is rather primitive and not very intuitive in its design.I used it for  a few days. but then the novelty wore off and I realized that Im going to have to cough up some more money for a better unit.,3,0,294
ATI491ZHUTVNF,0,This cd player skips or jumps on brand new cds.  God forbid put one with a few microparticles of lint or a thumbnail scratch in it. Biggest waste of money Ive ever spent on Amazon!,1,0,180
ATIEOSZ5EX38B,1121,I received this camera as a gift 2 and a half years ago and loved it during most of that time. The problem with this camera is that once the warranty expires. the camera will soon follow! It started flashing H .meaning the camera no longer works. shortly after the warranty expired. Good luck getting any help from Canon. after months of trying. they wouldnt help out at all. They wont even tell you what is wrong with it unless you agree to pay them for repairs! Search the web and youll find this happens to everyone. This camera is junk and you should avoid it like the plague...,1,0,582
ATIESTXNUFNSW,33,I returned this item. I found an older production year so I could do the channel mods I wanted. I love the radio. the fact that it can be both a mobile and hand held has corba beat hands down.,3,0,192
ATJGJ1O9TEYNJ,0,I found this same unit in my garage that my dad has never used but am I able to talk to others with this unit?,4,1,110
ATJW6ZGNTB5SF,0,The directions on this lens cleaner says that you should clean your deck every 10 hours.  Hell. Ive never cleaned it in two years.  Now it sounds like new again.,5,0,161
ATKWAG46FCB3S,4249,This is a really good tablet. I havent had experience with the Kindle yet. If you have it rooted. then it turns into a full fledged tablet and it is awesome. Highly recommended.,4,1,177
ATLVCAJY0IX18,0,MP3 players are truly a great idea. but this product is not very practical.  It only has 32MB of memory and the upgrade cost is almost like buying another whole player.  I enjoy using mine for exercising  its  light and doesnt skip.  However. it is very touchyquirky.  Dont bump it  or the whole thing will turn off.  And sometimes it will automatically  pause play even when I have the u0026quotholdu0026quot feature engaged.  The  technology is great. and Id like to upgrade but Im going to wait until  players can hold more memory or until MP3s can be further compressed.  This  would be one of the coolest products ever if it could hold your entire  library of music.  For those of you that cant wait that long. go for at  least 64MB.,2,0,738
ATLWPU9UHIT0A,0,This tablet is amazing for running apps at home or using it as an ereader. I was a little skeptical. considering the price. but it is a solid tablet. I originally bought it with the intent of rooting it. but even on the default Android OS. I am able to run everything i need from the google play store. Obviously gps. led. and camera functions dont work. but of course it was never designed for that. The kindle app works good which makes me wonder why anyone would get a different Androidbased ereader.,5,1,503
ATLYYBE1OCCTO,22,I initially purchase the Nook Color last year as a cheap alternative for a web device to check email and surf and read a few books now and then when not lugging my laptop around.  When they upgraded and opened the Android capabilities it became an Android Table PC with dedicated email app and improved web goodies.  At last check they now have 366 apps and growing. most are kid stuff and games but do have some useful apps for weather. calendar. note taking. Flight checker. etc.  I can transfer Word. Excel. photos and music to it and learn more each time I mess with it.The one thing missing was a 3G capability of the black n white version.  Both 3G and Bluetooth are built into the guts but who knows if and when they will be turned on.  My solution is Virgin Mobiles Broadband2Go MiFi wireless that supports up to 5 connections.  You can use it for as little as 10 bucks for 10 days or 20 bucks for a month and more options.  Ive used the USB version as a backup when traveling for about 3 years so felt OK with the WiFi version.  Works fine with the Nook. did have to use `Forget and reconnect the first time but now have a fall back `secure WiFi connection.Doesnt have some of the fancy features of bigger better and more costly Table PCs but for everyday email and surfing. ez to carry around with a nice cover. enough apps to suit in general with more to come it more than meets my needs and NO monthly bills to use it.,4,1,1430
ATM4QSXUDYRAG,13,I just put broadband into my powerlines and it rocks. i am now getting over 50mbs with my electric outlet plugs to powerline boxes. can you say HD HULU sweet picture.,5,0,166
ATM4Y7TA3STLO,12,The best ereader on the market. Simple as it says. Great tool for education. and I highly recommend Nook for anyone. Despite the insistance of Barnes and Nobel to make us believe that the use of this product is restricted to the U.S. users. I have to say. It works world wide.As for the interface. is very intuitive and as its name says. its very simple to use. It supports traditional epub. pdf. jpeg and to my surprise. it reads MS Office doc and docx files without any issue. The screen is way better and more gentle with the eye. than any kindle device. Its the fastest reader so fast. The only limitations are. a. the fact you can only use wifi to buy from the barnes and noble sotre. b. despite the kindle. it reads no mp3. and has no text to speech function. Consider to buy an additional memory card to increase the capacity of this device and to buy it from BluProton seller. they have one of the finest and most efficient services worldwide.,5,1,951
ATNZ05MUO4PRV,23,We ordered 4 for the  kids .2 from one source. 2from another. 3 registered with no issues. 1 gave an error message that could only be resolved by calling customer service. I was worried. as it was Christmas morning and I had read horrible reviews of the customer service for Bu0026N in the forums. They picked up in three rings and after only two levels of phone tree. They helped me resolve the issue in 15 minutes. Tablets are great. only reason for a 4 star and not a 5 is it was their error that it wouldnt register in the first place.,4,1,539
ATOKK4WDG6PF7,12,Ran out of space on my phone. so bought this. now I can keep putting tons of music on my phone.  Really easy to install. really easy to use.  Would recommend to anyone.,5,0,168

ATW2I5S6S2PFA,12,I bought this product so I could share files and a printer between my desktop and my laptop.  My laptop already had an existing LAN card so I didnt need to install on of the NICs on it.  I opened up my desktop and slid the card right into one of the available PCI slots and closed the desktop up and turned it on.  Windows recognized the card and I used the included drivers disk to install the drivers.  These were all step by step instructions that I followed.  Excellent instructions.  Then I followed the instructions for file and print sharing and within ten minutes I was transferring files from my laptop to my desktop and printing files from my laptop on my desktops printer. BTW...the two computers have to be within 50 feet of each other or else youll need a new cable.Simple setup. Works well. Great price.Theres only one small problem.  The file transfer isnt incredibly fast.  So transferring files of more than five megabytes takes more than a few seconds.  Not much to gripe about though.,5,1,1003
ATW2I5S6S2PFA,22,I ordered this product thinking that I didnt have any USB ports in my  computer.  I was wrong.  But I kept it anyway. just in case.  It was a  simple installation.  The directions were straightforward and helpful.  I  had the card in my computer within 10 minutes and I started it up.  I  disregarded the fact that I needed my Windows 98 CD for the drivers.  That  slowed me down.  I tried to get by this many different ways but none  worked.  I probably screwed myself up by trying to find the correct driver  in another way.  I ended up having to reinstall windows and then everything  worked great.  There was no other trouble.  Just be sure that you have your  Windows 98 CD handy!,4,1,685
ATWC3WIN06B9A,11,I am so pleased with my new Nook Touch. I have already purchased 4 books and am reading them all. The best part is that there are so many good books that are free . even one OTNT free Bible.and most others are under USD10. There is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the Nook has WiFi.I really like everything about it. especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by Bu0026N or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit Bu0026N store for help.I would highly recommend.,5,1,564
ATWGYTD3TUU4C,33,I got the boombox in January and all my friends love it....i just adore it.. The music quality is really good and also the output is good...especially when i listen to techno song...the  remote also comes in  handy...plus everything is digital which is of great convinience,5,1,273
ATX0KZB5ITH08,23,The Dazzle is a great product for the digitization of VHS and other sources with an RCA output.  However you should understand that it is not a exactly a full digital workshop.  The included software is farely unintuitive and useful only for capturing the video in mpeg format.  Altering and arranging the video proves difficult with the included software. and overall pointless.  To work with the video. I recommend having a large amount of hard drive space available .I digitized a two hour vhs movie which took approximately 2gigs of hd space..  On the plus side. this device was extremely easy to setup. and worked well on my PIII 900 laptop w 128 at any quality level.  This device does capture the video extrememly well.  I was able to capture video at well above vhs quality with little trouble .the only restriction to this is the aformentioned size requirements which can be taken care of with a little file conversion.  I recommend DivX..  To this end the device has been very useful. with variable quality selections depending on your source.  One last note. Do not buy this device if your purpose is to watch tv.  For some reason I have yet to find a piece of software that will allow me to watch the incoming video fullscreen at 30fps.,4,1,1248
ATXHGENR16TFT,1414,The wall mount installed easily and works smoothly.  The only downside is adjusting the up and down tilt. you must loosen a bolt most of the way before you can muscle the TV into a different position.,4,1,200
ATXRV6Z3N08ZX,11,I purchased 2 Universal Travel AC Wall Adapters. with USB Charger. for my daughters trips to Europe.  Both units worked for about 1 day or less. when they stopped working during use.  They used them with dual voltage camera battery chargers.  I had also given them straight plug adapters.  Thank God that I did!  The straight plug adapters. which I bought in 1999. still worked. and lasted them the rest of the trip.  Good thing I also included USB charger units.  So they could not charge 2 items at the same time. since the new wall adapters broke. but they got their gadgets charged with the other plugs.I put in a request to return these to the seller .HandHelditems..  And they did NOT honor it because I bought it a few months back. but the kids trips were not until the past few weeks.  I guess I should have tried them out after we first got them.,1,0,855
ATY9TEWF275VS,22,I bought this case as an accessory to my HP 315 PhotoSmart digital camera. I like the camera very much so it may be biasing my view of the bag. but here goes.I like the bag. It is attractive to look at. It is a bit big for the camera I bought. but too big is better than too small!Its got one main pouch that is very large and I use it to hold my camera and all my cords.It has a shoulder strap that I dont like .because it makes me look like a tourist..Overall it is a very good bag. if a little large with an ugly shoulder strap.,4,1,531
ATYDR87DEATVQ,0,After reading other comments about this product I decided to try it. It really only worked for one vhs movie and then I had to repeat the cleaning. After several time of this I took the VHS player case apart and cleaned the head with alcohol and a tissue. then let it dry. then wiped the head off carefully again. The VHS player is like new again and after at least 15 movies .lots of grandkid time. it is still working well. Dont waste your money on this cleaner product.,2,0,472
ATYH4R8FOV9YK,1,I just got back from a camping trip expecting this charger to work however. when I plugged it in. my nook tablet says  not charging  and doesnt even give any juice to the battery. The cord that is advertised is totally not what I got. it is easily 10 inches shorter than the standard cord. and doesnt even have the  n  that lights up. The plug in looks totally perfect and has the Barnes and Noble labels and print. but the cord is kinda the most important part and it is totally wrong. I will be looking for a refund. The cord I received probably is just a standard micro USB cord that could power any Android smart phone. I highly recommend not wasting the USD20 I did to get this product.,1,0,691
ATYQBGM6Q5UMD,0,If the cord was 1 foot longer. 5 stars.  I dont get it.  Is someone saving 2 cents for every one of these?  Or..  make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer.  Would have been great if it came with a removable ear clipwire but not really complaining about that.  Maybe a future feature.  Then again. if they cant make the cord 1 foot longer. I wouldnt expect any other luxuries.  Functionally seems fine.,4,1,419
ATZ7DA91DAJ31,0,If you find yourself in need of a keypad. this one is definitely the way to go. I use it for an MP3 player I built for my car. and it fits nicely between the two front seats. Im very happy with the performance. its size. and the color goes well with the black interior of my car. I had to purchase a 6 pin DIN to 5 pin DIN adapter to get it to work with my system .its not included.. but it works well. Buy this today!!,5,1,419
ATZWOZPFN2NFQ,46,This tape is OLD and it doesnt work well.  It will not print on certain sections of the tape. leaving blank spots.  I couldnt use it at all.  I had to go out and buy new tape at the local office supply store.,1,0,208
AU0N0LGXMV0GY,26,The cable is fine for applications where you have a monitor that is 15u0026quot or below and runs in low resolution. If you are planning to run a larger monitor. like most of us do. then this product will not meet your standards. The result of coupling this cable to a 19u0026quot monitor running highresolution are ghostly images. In short pay the 30  40 USD to purchase a thicker cable.,3,0,388
AU0T5Y6E2JU3X,5252,It is from Belkins. Although it can be used. it is not as adorable as in the picture. But it is cheap.,3,0,102
AU112B36150FI,14,When this product worked it only worked 3 times.  Went to use it again today and nothing.  It would not connect to my TV.  The item description says no external power needed. that is not true.  The tablets power cable needed to be plugged in to allow the device to recognize the HDMI cable.,2,0,290
AU1BECFYR4GKT,0,Was given one of these for my laptop at work.  Seemed OK. so I got one for my daughter to use at school and we set and tested the combination before she left.When she got the lock on. the same combination was suddenly not working to get it open so I had to take a hacksaw to it during a campus visit.Now the same thing has just happened to the one I have at work.  Fortunately it happened when I was trying to put it on.These phantom combination resets make the product very unreliable.,1,0,486
AU1K0QIS49AMK,33,I purchased this item about three weeks ago and portions of it already stopped working the car adapter and the wall plug. I cant rate the item very strongly. The USB cable works fine and is longer than the factory supplied cable making it a little easier to connect the phone for charging and use while its charging. The seller and I were in contact and they are going to reinburse me a portion of my expense .which I am fine with.. But at the end I wouldnt recommend it for a Cliq XT.,4,1,485
AU2M83OS00GR7,0,Although it says its for Acer Iconia Tab. it will work in most devices that can support 32 GB. Nonetheless. the package got here in a speedy fashion and its been working great in my Iconia Tab.,5,0,193
AU2VBY0L22JYX,0,Expensive but worth the price! I have not been able to locate these tapes anywhere. I still use cassette for live recording.,5,0,124
AU4EJ90HZF0QV,12,I had to return these phones as they were essentially unusable for spoken words.  I use headphones on the computer for both music listening and internet phone calls.  Music sounded okay. although there was some detectable hissing.  However. talk .or anything with silent patches. was very choppy.  You could make out what was being said. but it made extended calls somewhat aggravating.On the plus side. the phones were very comfortable.,2,0,437
AU4XBHCLBYSXI,33,The Nook was disappointing for me.  What really kills it is the operating system.  It is based on Android but it doesnt resemble android at all.  Your home screen is limited to a bookshelf and the app selection is pathetic not even a Facebook app!  There are almost no apps at all and the ones that are there you almost always have to pay for.  It is great for reading magazines and books. however. and it is really easy to purchase content from Barnes and Noble.  As far as the hardware is concerned it is okay.  The screen is nice. but the body feels a little cheap.  It doesnt have a camera or gps.  Overall I would say that this is a good ebook reader but its not good for anything else.  The Blackberry Playbook is a superior tablet and it is in the same price range as the Nook.,3,0,784
AU5SICRRG9BAE,22,great package. well worth the money.  only complaint is that the reader program lacks a bit. unlike my Mad Magazine .Every Issue. viewer program.  Maybe Bondi should get together with Broderbund and redo theirs.gregory,4,1,218
AU7YDEXT5YF8X,1,I dont like the product that much. but the company delivered it very quickly. The Nook pales in comparison to both the Kindle and the Ipad and I regret purchasing it.,3,0,166
AU845QNJBTWDQ,0,Anyone who knows anything about patch cables would understand that the way belkins patch cables are packaged add undue stress to the cable.... The cable is wound too tight to fit in the small packaging. StarTech.com. Panduit and Nordx are the only companies I have seen that properly package CAT5E cables.. So buyer beware...,1,0,325
AUAY6L0QQXX3X,0,After Nook added Google Play. I ditched my Kindle Fire HD. So many more apps than the Kindle and works just as well for books and magazines at a cheaper price.,4,0,159
AUBJ3QG98DGW9,45,I hope you never have to return your nook for it is a hassel.  This week I have spent over 3 hrs on phone with them and I am still not satisfied with the result.  I bought a nook color a month ago and loved it.  It went out on me and they sent me a refurbished one to replace it.  I told them I did not want a refurbished one.  They will tell you anything to get you off the phone.,3,0,381
AUD0KK2KMDQA0,0,When I got this. I was disappointed in the packaging. there was no invoice or return information. The Nook was broken. Amazon was very helpful and is working with me and the company Q Peng for a refund. Since then I have bought another one and it is great! I wanted it for traveling and reading outside. Perfect! Light and very easy to use.,1,0,340
AUDSB403UNG6L,0,I bought this DVD player and have had no problems whatsoever.  The picture quality has been flawless. as has the sound.  I have NOT had any lipsync or fuzzy lines. etc.I have played both Austin Powers movies. Rounders. Contact. Pulp Fiction. and two Gratefuld Dead  DVDs. along with an assortment of audio CDs.It did take me a little  while how to figure out how to get the audio set up properly for 5.1. as  the default setup when you buy it is for just two front speakers.,4,1,474
AUDX9GOFB4MAQ,1010,VERY  HELPFULL...  GOOD  OPTION FOR  USB  ...MP3..  IPODS  IPADS AN  EVERYTHING  WORKS FINE WHEN ITS NEEDED..  GREATE OPTION ... IM  HAPPY WHIT  THIS,3,0,149
AUETPJTNRQASR,0,I paid more for Like New but it was filthy and smelly. It plays but not all the buttons are fully operable.,3,0,107
AUEV3H21LRMHJ,0,This item did not work for my Canon Power Shot ELPH 330 HS camera.  It connected to the camera and TV fine but had no signal to the TV.  I returned it and purchased another cable that stated it was for a Canon Power Shot ELPH 330 HS camera and it did work.  I dont know if this cable had a short or a different wiring issue.,1,0,324
AUFYMX8AP7J06,0,This external drive did not work for me.  I tried it on 3 different systems all with different OSs.  Each system was able to recognize the driver. but I was unable to save anything disk.  It has been returned.,1,0,209
AUGCNSOB698BT,44,The headphones work pretty well. I bought them because I already had Advent wireless speakers. and I wouldnt have to set up another transmitter. The sound quality if fine. and I dont have much of a problem tuning the headphones to receive the signal from the stereo. But. after wearing them for few minutes it gets to be painful. They hurt too much to wear them for more than a few minutes at a time. and there is no way to adjust them so that they dont cause pain!,1,0,465
AUGKVL076AUOR,45,Wow...im impressed. I cant believe I get this piece of equipment for so small price.One of the cool features of the minidisc is the support for a rechargeable battery .it takes only 3 hours to recharge. the jog dial. the remote control and the weight.I record MP3 from my computer to the minidisc. they sound great. its a better and a lot cheaper way of taking your mp3 songs with you.By the way. If you have a digital output on the computer or in your cd player the cable is included.,5,1,485
AUHG5P9MVM00D,22,Most of the time my cassette player spits it back out after it has a mini seizure and when it finally does accept it there is an incessant clicking noise. In order to have the music play at an audible level I had to max out my phones media volume and then practically blast my radios.,1,0,284
AUHY56MLGBM37,0,I bought this product a month ago and I absolutely love it! During my research phase of buying an eReader. I went back and forth on this product because of all the negative reviews. However. with the new upgrade and price drop. this device is definitely one of the best on the market. The greatest thing about it. is that you can personalize the screensaver to whatever you want. The screen is fantastic as well as the touch screen at the bottom. You can turn the wifi off .via airplane mode. for longer battery life and set the touch screen to turn off after so many minutes. This also has the option for replacing the battery yourself as well as removable storage .memory cards. so youll never have to worry about running out of space.BUY THIS PRODUCT!,5,1,754
AUJBLLIBCDB5L,22,Had difficulty understanding each other with these. When using the walkie talkies directly they were fine. but with these the sound was muddled and very difficult to understand at times. Probably discontinued for a reason.,2,0,222
AUJW8OFJKG7Z8,0,I can only agree with everybody else. The bad is big. but it pays off after a while. becuase you can carry Smart Media cards. batteries. a camera. a cable. a pair of sunglasses and a microrecording device in this bag at the same time. For me as a music journalist. thats a great thing. The bad thing is that you cant really wear it over yur shoulder like a bigger bag. It looks and feels dumb. Besides that. this is a good product.,4,1,431
AUJX2DUPAHI3T,11,I worked as well as advertised. It is the best that I have seen in awhile. I would recomend this product to anyone who wants to clean their tape player without any hassle.,5,0,171
AUKMX8TAFE3BA,1313,the cable itself is very flimsy compared to the OEM Canon.  Seems to work ok so represents exceptional value for money.,4,1,119
AUKNZLS417IMB,0,I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas and am sure she will love it. as will her parents.  Thank you,4,1,113
AUKT798LO8XCP,0,Case is just what I needed. and at a very good price!  If you are not wanting to spend a lot of money. this is the case for you. Also the color is just as shown. very bright.,4,1,174
AUL0JCNC6QZ2L,0,This tape. when used in the Brothers label maker is superb. The letters are easy to read. Unlike other labels Ive used. the backing is easy to peal off. I even labelled the breakers in my electrical panel. Im glad they have a QWERTY keyboard and not an AZ dial. makes typing labels a breeze. I recommend typing labels in batches. with a few spaces between each. then print the entire batch. and cut apart with sissors. that minimizes wasted tape.,5,1,446
AULKRRY1VAG7I,1616,I was looking to update my old CD player with something new to go running with and listen to music at work. This little player is lightweight for running. doesnt skip. and has nice bass. I found the headphones to be a  little cumbersome with the volume control for exercise purposes. but that  is probably because I am used to another set. I highly recommend this  product. Also. Amazon sent it off in 24 hours and I got it the day after I  ordered using standard shipping. Order the batteries .cheap anyway. so you  can use it right out of the box. This product is great and really worth the  money. It is more of a purple color rather than the ice blue in the  picture. but I think it is still very good looking. Buy it!,5,1,722
AULMMRL9XITWH,9394,Not what I wanted or expected. from the picture. I thought they were all individual clips that broke apart. I have used the individual clips already and might find a use for the multiple cable pieces in the future.,3,0,214
AUM8UUENL9Y4H,11,I ordered this item after i got a Garmin gps. i thought it would be helpful since the Garmin did not come with one.  I wish i had read the reviews.  This is not a Garmin product!  It is a generic cell phone charger and I wont even try it.  After receiving it. i went to the reviews and saw the problems the other users wrote about and I will not take a chance of damaging my unit.  This seller should not be allowed to advertise selling a Garmin Nuvi charger and then sending a generic cell phone charger!!  As others wrote. it would probably cost more to return it than what i paid.  Not right!,1,0,595
AUMJC6WY81CEI,0,Did exactly as it is advertised. Be aware. however. that there is only one .tiny. brush on the disk. Other brands have a few. or many .if that matters to you.. Ive always had good luck with Maxell.,4,1,197
AUMSRT8NIFE5R,0,What can I say? its and hdmi cable and it works!Ran it from my main PC to my HDTV in front of the couch. works beautifully.,5,0,123
AUN9946JOX6VX,11,I noticed the person who gave this player a bad review mentioned it was worst than his inexpensive VCR. That rang a bell. Because of the DVDs copyright protection mechanism. you can not run a DVD thru a VCR to a TV.  Although this person didnt describe their setup. the mention of the  comparison to an inexpensive VCR might imply that they also have a tv with  only one video input. Most people with such a setup would be tempted to  have both a VCR and DVD player connected at the same time. Going thru a VCR  seems like it should work. but it wont. Any DVD player will outperform any  VCR player. When someone says otherwise. there is an error somewhere.,4,1,657
AUOF7KMZRE4RG,57,The only discreption I have is the tools that the kit came with. Because I do not own any I had to resort to the tools they provided which were difficult to use when installing. It would have been great if it came with a stud finder as well,4,1,240
AUOLUGSGOPALK,0,This piece of junk takes hours to set up and you really need a laptop also. After that you can buy books with your credit card if everything works perfect which it never does. Also you need wifi after all that you can read a book. Save the time and just buy the book or really lose your mind a go to a used book store and buy any book you want for around a dollar and finally dont even consider calling tech support they are useless.,1,0,433
AUPCERMZ6ASML,450,Amazon is sending a replacement.  Unfortunately mine arrived damaged and I had to return it.  They say Dry Tape Head Cleaners are better than wet.  Maxwell has been in VHS and cassettes for awhile so I imagine it will be worth the investment. Im hoping to download my video collection on DVD.  So it will get much use!,3,0,318
AUPXH9FVDNMZB,0,The order was placed for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and the 32GB was  TOO  large for my phone. I was very disappointed. because I had already trashed the return info,1,0,159
AUPYL8YLQCWNY,11,I have a limited number of phone jacks in my home. and the RC930 helps out alot.  Without it. I would have phone line strung everywhere.  I use the RC930 for internet access for my computer upstairs.  I usually connect between 33.2 and 34.6 Kbps with the units about 15 feet apart.  I have had fluctuations in the speed from 19.237.4 Kbps depending on what I have operating at the time.  Its a little slow. but not bad for surfing the web or playing some online games.  I wouldnt recommend it if you download large files. and I keep a long phone cord for those purposes.  If you dont mind phone cord all over the place. then Id recommend just purchasing the extra phone cord however. if youd like an alternative. then the RC930 works fine.  The price is way too high for what its worth. though.  This is why I only give it 3 stars.,3,0,831
AURCMF0N3RJN1,1011,I hate the weight it would have with 6 D size batteries.,1,0,56
AURW67ORPANXK,735,Excellent Motorola quality and when paired with the TA280s excellent volume levels .plus control.. it allows you to use it even in crowded. noisy environments.  The ease of use and its inconspicuousness make it an invaluable addition to the Talk Abouts. but there is room for improvement.  My biggest complaint is that the TA280289 dont allow for the alert tone .call tones  menu tones  etc.. volumes to be regulated.  This makes for some very uncomfortably loud noise spikes with that earbud only an inch or so from your eardrum.  The TA280289 DO allow the alert tones to be disabled. but that makes it a little more difficult to operate .especially when you have them tucked away under your outer clothing.. My only other complaint was in the design of the PTTMIC housing.  I wouldve preferred something a little easier to use with gloves on .the PTT button is 12u0026quot from the MIC and pressing it with gloves on covers the MIC...... In closing. the alert tone volume issue is a TA280289 one. not this units and Id buy this again if I were to lose this one. but I sure wish theyd improve on it.,3,0,1100
AUSAKTBWOOLJ0,2323,Nice MP3 player.Dont get it if you want to play WMAs and it doesnt support generic drivers and isnt supported by Windows XP .something I found out AFTER I upgraded my PC to XP.,3,0,176
AUSJJ0MP8895H,33,I got these speakers about a week ago and I am extremely happy with their peformance. For the price you cant really go wrong with these. The  subwoofer puts out enough bass for my neighbors to complain. These are  great little speakers.,5,1,236
AUSUJMAH06AZ5,45,The cable works and was easy to install.  The connectors fit properly and the cable is long enough for most uses.  The picture is somewhat blurry and has very bad ghosting.  The cable probably is not well shielded.  I would recommend to purchase another product with better shielding.,2,0,284
AUTXRASEFDJWT,0,Best buy associate did not help me with Kindle. i snapped. bought a nook. Loving it. Dont know why i was going for the kindle in the first place. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get something between a kindle and an ipad.,5,1,236
AUU7VWG48ERME,23,I ordered 4 of these for my kids new iPods. None of the mics worked on any of the iPods. When I tried them on my iPhone 3GS. they worked. but overrode the speakers. Why would I want to use it on my iPhone that already has a builtin mic where the speakers work with the builtin mic? This product does not work on the devices I bought them for. which the description said the mics would work with. The mics do have a place on the cap to attach them to a chain or keyring. but the mic itself is easily removed from the cap. so losing the mic would be likely. Overall. terrible product.,1,0,582
AUUTH6K51OCWO,0,i bought it last week and tried it to my my car cd player.toyota camry 2007....it didnt work and still i got error message...dont waste ur money for this junk...,1,0,161
AUVE2FIIK2G36,3,I bought this exact model 2 years ago and I do not regret it at all.  For the price you get a 16u0026quot viewable surface. product support from koreadatasystems .you can even find the driver for Win NT95982000 there. and a monitor that will hold up through many computer  upgrades.  The only disappointing factor about this monitor is that the dot  pitch is rather high in comparison with other well known brands. This means  if you spent USDUSDUSD on your GeForce card you may not be seeing the entire  picture the way you probably should be seeing it. If. however. you are  looking for a good well built monitor and have a budget  this one is for  you.,4,1,655
AUVWCMH836UG3,4345,I suppose if you have some experience dealing with the MP3 format. this is as good as the reviews state. Not for me. The Rio comes with no written instructions and the software u0026quotHELPu0026quot is next to useless. A myriad  of small irritating problems such as why when I check off only one or two  songs to transfer do I get a message that the rio doesnt have enough  memory available. The only clue being that mysteriously all songs on  transfer list are now checked. Probably most of the issues I had could have  been easily resolved but to make a long story short I threw in the towel  and gave mine to a friend.,1,0,622
AUWG3HK4IAG92,58,Bought a Nook in September 2010.  Used it solely in my home.  Now. its February 2011 and it had multiple lines running vertically on the screen.  Customer service is terrible. routes your calls to all the garbage 3rd world countries of the world.  Cant undersand them and they run you through all the tier1 support questions for an hour.  Still gets you no where.  Finally got a return label but I hear that they send you a refurb item back.  Great.I only bought the Nook over the Kindle because the Nook supports DRM .free downloads from libraries and what not.. but Kindle has better controls.  I will find another ereader than supports DRM and eat the cost myself.  Maybe get an extended warranty?,2,0,700
AUWJGUU4IGDWG,25,It turns on.  It turns off.  It charges. However attempting to secure it to ANY book in such a manner that the light actually shines on the page is enough to make you pull your hair out.  I have resorted to holding it in my free hand in order to illuminate the text.  I am a  Moleskine junkie. and have been for decades.  I own virtually every product they make and would buy others if they existed.  The book light is definitely a nonstarter.  I will add that if it worked as well as it looks I would be effusive in my praise.,2,0,527
AUWWQX0VM9PS6,11,I went for the lowest cost machine. but that was a mistake I wont repeat. The TEAC W600R worked great for two weeks .about the time it took me to dub 15 tapes to my PC.. Then. the drive mechanisms in both bays stopped working and the machine began to produce loud clicking sounds. No amount of turning the machine offon or hitting buttons worked to correct it. The unit is junk and is being returned.,1,0,400
AUYXVI79B0L6Q,1414,This is one of the top rated shower radios I found with my research.  My husband likes to listen to talk radio in the morning while showering and shaving.  This model is far better than his old one.,4,1,198

AV2084J5O9X8Y,11,A firend .who is not good with computers. learned to use the 3.5 floppy that is used with this camra.Had a newer camera but he could not handle the downloading directly into his computer.Yes  I know its not that hard.  But he does not understand and memorizes how to do it.When his MVCFD73 was taken out of his truck  he was lost with out it.I knew it was an old model and figured none would be available.BUT There it was on Amazon as a like new used camera at a very low price.It made one guy very happy.Plus got nim off my back.,5,1,530
AV2XSTX7D7E6C,0,The overall product is awesome! I love it. its portable. its easily accessible. and I can access normal webpages like I can on a computer as long as theres wifi. Only thing that caused it to lose a star is that the chargerUSB that comes with it is very flimsy. Its easily breakable and they have yet to get back to me on a replacement charger. Also you cannot use any other USB even if it fits the tablet. it must be the USB specially made to fit the Nook tablet. Although other USBs can be used to transfer data.,4,1,513
AV37OYMO8I9WD,11,The adhesive lasts about two days before the clip falls off the wall.  There is no other way to mount the clip.  Useless.  I threw them in the garbage.,1,0,151
AV3OBZ3Z8YM5A,44,Ok. Ive read the other reviews. and I am not the professional on car alarms.  But if youre looking at getting this alarm. you dont own some exotic car thats worth tons of money.  Youd be looking at a lojac .sp?.  system or something like that.  More than likely. you have an ordinary car.  and you dont even know if you want to use the alarm. but you want to save  some money on your car insurance.  And if thats what youre after. this  alarm definitely does the trick.  And if you want a bit of safety to go  along with it. this will work too.First off. the warning about the  warranty card is true.  You have seven days to send it in. so make sure you  stick a stamp on and get it out pronto.I cant say that this alarm is so  much quieter than its supposed to be. because the first thing I thought  when turning it on was u0026quotdang. cant this thing be quieter?u0026quot  So  if its in your garage or driveway. dont worry. youll hear it.  And if  somebody jumps on your car to sit on it. theyll hear it too!Next. if  you read about the u0026quot7 talking messagesu0026quot. and thought it would say  things like u0026quotyoure too close to the car.u0026quot etc. youre wrong.  Part of the 7 messages are u0026quotarmedu0026quot. u0026quotdisarmedu0026quot.  u0026quotplease set the alarm now .or something like that.u0026quot. etc.The  system is easy to set up. but the 10 minutes may be pushing it.  I think it  took more than 10 minutes alone to figure out where the thing will fit in  my car!  Youll need to have an electric drill. as youll be going directly  into the metal of the car with the screws.  When you pick a location. keep  in mind that theres 2 parts to the alarm. the base u0026amp the body. and  youll need to detatch those to get the base secured to the car. but then  reattach them.  That can be a pain if its in a wrong location.  Otherwise.  you plant the base. reattach the body. and then theres an alligator clip  that stretches to the car battery. hook that up. and youre done. other  than setting the alarm.All in all. you can save 25% off of your comp  portion of your car insurance. and get a little piece of mind.  Especially  if you want to be one of those annoying other people with a car alarm that  goes off!Joe,4,1,2249
AV5BIXJGI56L5,77,I was amazed that this sells for over USD.money.. I was fooled by what looked like a sturdy and attractive case. It is poorly made out of cheap plastic  I expected much better from Palm. It doesnt close properly and makes hotsyncing difficult.There are better cases out there.,1,0,276
AV5HIT3XQS7VC,22,Im not an audiophile. but I can tell to anyone how goooood it sounds!! After its brakein period. the sound became spacious. crisp and clear. Originally was a little bit stiff. Good things. solid. Well built. It has CLASS and presence. It has 2 JBL speakers pumping 10 watts each. 20 Watts coming from the integrated subwoofer. I love its bass! Its tight. cozy. espectacular and clear. VERY unusual quality of sound for its price. I even hooked up a single tape deck to it. and I listen also to my tapes while in bed. I have also cranked it up several times. including with the Beethovens 9th and the crazy sounddtrack from A Clockwork Orange. It came out impervious!! What a puppy!! The JBL Harmony is a very versatil. dual ALARM CLOCK. AMFM RADIOCD PLAYER and a very decent ornament in the table bed too. Its so good in sound reproduction that people entering the room will be surprised the sound is coming from such a little thing!! Its sound will make you think it came out of an expensive component turned on and hidden somewhere in your bedroom. Im not going to get into the technical data. Ill let you check it up by yourself under u0026quotexplore this itemu0026quot. Im just telling you how tremendous value it is and how beautifully it sounds. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE MARKET THAT CAN COMPETE WITH THIS PUPPY IN QUALITY. CRAFTMANSHIP. SOUND AND VALUE FOR THE MONEY.On the bad side. Display cannot be read from 2 ft away. You hardly can tell what track is being played even by getting closer than one foot to check it out and you cant even tell what time it is from the other side of your bed. The remote is nonilluminated. No treblebass controls whatsoever. but its functional when you can see its markings to activate its functions.  You will love it!!,5,1,1761
AV5VJ70TKBDJ0,33,Clearly the best! This is my fourth radar and its without a doubt the BEST one Ive ever had! Very quite. 95% of my signals are true.,5,0,132
AV6D1JXE5GA6K,2125,Auto insert installation didnt work. After install...several attempts and reboots later...just a grey box stating database not found. Its going back to the store the same day I bought it. Ease of installation should really  mean just that.,1,0,239
AV6F00HIINRQD,33,Bought this camera for my wife but it seems that everyone in the family has a use for it. I heard many bad things about this camera while I was looking to buy. Everything from bad pictures to the annoying blinking green light in the view finder. But let me tell you that after buying this camera I have found nothing bad about it. Its very easy to use and to setup on your computer. I love the ease in using the small SmartMedia storage card that holds your pictures in the camera. It comes with a 2meg card but you may want to buy another with it for more storage while on vacation or for when you dont have time to get all the pictures off one card. I bought the 8meg card at the same time as the camera and found that I had way more space then I needed but was happy knowing that I would not run out. .8meg card holds up to around 300 pics!. Where I work they have a digital camera that cost them about USD.... it has a few more features that are nice but not really needed and I feel that the 640 takes as good of pictures. You can not go wrong with the price or the quality!,5,1,1079
AV6MO2VN8ZJ4,55,I bought this after finding a few old kodak picture disks around and am I am in the midst of digitalizing my photo library. This drive claims to work with Mac OS. which it does .I guess. with a lot of bugs. Basically upon plugging in. it installs itu00268217s own drivers. but there is no notification that it is doing so. Ok. I can work around that. I inserted a disk and it brought up a message that the disk was not initialized which I assumed might happen. Ok. I can work around that. Unfortunately when you eject .either through the file manager or manually.. for some reason the drive cannot recognize any disks after that. What I mean is that once you insert another disk. you can hear it spinning. but it will not read or acknowledge that there is a disk in the drive. After multiple tries. I found that the drive either needs to be unplugged or the computer shut off to get it to recognize valid disks. Basically I didnu00268217t have high hopes for the disks I found. but I did have higher hopes for the functionality of this product as it was 23 times more costly than other disk drives out there.I cannot make any claims to how it performs with Windows software. but for Mac. I would look elsewhere for a different product.,2,0,1235
AV7IC2XPCKZTA,0,I have wanted a Palm Pilot since they came out and being a poorcollege student. I wanted to make sure that I got the best dealpossible.  I have had my Palm IIIx for about a month and I can say that I am quite pleased with it. There are a few flaws. but I will present the pros and cons of purchasing a Palm IIIx. Please email me with any questions.Pros. There is an abundance of software out there and several sites.  More software is coming out daily and some of my favs are jot. Traffic. Four.zero. and flash. among others. You will get a lot of attention. this is a great toy and people are interested in it. an excellent way to get organized. much more fun than a pad a paper and plus. there are alarms to remind you of important dates. The handwriting recognition is superb. I once owned a Davinci which has horrible recognition. I would also suggest Jot. which is a program with a more advanced handwriting recognition system. Customer support is ok. Im not blown away by it but I can understand because there are a lot of palm users out there. The price. In my opinion. it is the best value out there.Cons. yes. you have heard it everywhere. The backlight is pretty weird. But its not terrible. it does the job I have had mine crash twice in a month. but luckily only one time did I lose data.  There is a u0026quotsoftu0026quot reset which comes in handy Everyone else says the hotsych is great. but I have had problems with it. I cannot get it to work on my computer. but that may be the exception.  no color display. but hey. I can live without it because it costs hundreds of dollars more.Overall. great product. Its fun and helps me to be more organized.  Buy it!,4,1,1675
AV88ZRRHV1ODY,6768,in west los angeles the arms of the antenna should actually point southwest to northeast. the antenna is good for inhouse installation. i installed it eastwest wise to fit it on a wall. just behind the blinds. i can receive about 10 channels now .used to receive only 2.. another advantage is that you dont have to adjust the antenna again after it is installed. compared to the pain you take for a retractable antenna. but it takes more time and energy to mount it the first time.,4,1,481

AV8WWKAUIUPH1,1,The CD player in our van has acted up ever since my parents bought it.  For some reason it will only play burned CDs that I make using blank CDs bought from the store.  I thought that perhaps the lens is dirty so I bought this to clean it.  It took close to 10 tries before the player even read the disc.  I followed the instructions to the dot and even let it clean more than double the time it said.  Unfortunately. the player still does not play artist CDs and still only plays burned CDs.  Oh well. it only a few bucks anyway.,3,0,530
AV90JD8C9IUD0,0,I bought this on the 27th of December after hassling with FedEx .to the point where I made them just hold it at a FedEx office. 2 days later I finally have it after .It was attempted for delivery on Friday 16. I was pleasently surprised to discover how small this thing is. Ive watched a ton of reviews and unboxing a on it and I guess the camera angles made it look wider. Its so tiny it can fit in a larger pocket .Like pajama pockets.. I already have 12 books and I actually finished one just now I started reading it at 1.30pm and its 11.45pm I say not bad the book was 155 pages too. Once I got the hang of it I was very pleased with my purchase and I recommend probably just getting the Nook Simple Touch but coming down to reading it doesnt matter just read people! Thats a little rant. So Ill maybe give another in depth review of this in a week. See you soon. thanks for reading my review.,4,1,898
AV91E5AI0QW0Y,22,I wasted an hour following directions. trying to install this thing. only to see my computer crash.  Program never installed successfully .despite icon appearing on desktop.never allowed transfer of images. When instructed  to remove floppy disk from drive. it emerged without its metal piece. thus  ruining my disk drive.,1,0,322
AVA3OYU7GHAI8,2330,This is a vary good playerrecorder. Only one problem though. the included  rechargable battery lasts only 65% of the time stated in the manual..5 Hrs  instead of 8 Hrs of playback . If I didnt have this problem. it was  perfect 4 me.,4,1,233

AVAKH3PJGHWKE,4154,I purchased this new in 1999 for USD420.Pros. Rarely had a problem playing retail DVDs Never had any problems with optics or electronics  still works fine 8 years later.Cons. Awkward form factor.  Fairly large .tall. and yet fairly shallow.  Its too tall to sit on top of a TV. yet too shallow and light to stack another components on. Does not play CDR discs. Does not play CDRW discs reliably .lots of skips. Problems playing DTS DVDA discs.  Not sure why. but I get no audio on some DVDAs when using DTS mode.Dont know why anybody in 2007 would ever have reason to purchase this.  Its a fairly mediocre DVD player.,2,0,617
AVAMQUXOSMRVD,0,I bought this cover to protect the screen of my Palm Vx.  It does that just fine and is pretty sturdy.  This means its also fairly thick  the device with the cover on is nearly twice as thick as the device without the cover on.Another disappointment was the leather clasp.  While it does keep the cover shut. the tongue part of the clasp is quite stiff and holds its same position even when the cover is open. blocking the screen. unless I force it out of the way with my pinky as I use device.  This is annoying and awkward.Also. the clamshell nature of the cover means that I cannot place the Palm on its charger without removing the case. stashing it somewhere nearby and adding to the clutter on my desk.In short. I would recommend getting a flat. flapstyle screen cover instead of a clamshell case. if all youre doing is carrying your Palm around in your pocket or purse. unless what I described above actually appeals to you.,2,0,931
AVAY73C9XMNUI,0,Products are good. Do NOT expect them to work at 25 miles. Range is a few miles for you to hear clearly. If your in the mountains and not in line of sight. youll encounter a lot of static or no sound at all. Must be VERY careful not to speak too closely to the mic .either just the unit or using the handheld. or else voices come across very distorted. Definitely a good product. but with the above limitations.,3,0,411
AVB4QB4LXZIY5,110,I received the Barnes and Noble Nookcolor a few days before christmas and immediately put it to use.  Its easy to start up and easy to understand.  I dont like the idea of wifi only connection for the simple fact. most things dont like my router.  I have a hard time connecting a lot of things wirelessly to it.  I had to use an ATu0026T hotspot in order to register it. not a bad thing but not ideal either.  I bought a casecrown case from ebay and I love that too.  I wish I could give this a 5 star rating but I just cant.  The touch screen is too sensitive and whenever I try to scroll down my library it opens up a book.  I can overlook this because its only an inconvenience at this point.  I know the battery life isnt the greatest because its backlit. fine I get that.  However when I tried to use it while it was charging it kept shocking me so I wound up putting it down and doing something else.  That too I can overlook.  What I cant overlook is Barnes and Noble themselves.  Their site has been messed up over the holidays and theyre having some issues with my account and the 2 gift cards I have on file.  Ive called them many times about it and they just cant seem to get it right.  I cant buy anything with the 2 gift cards on file because they tell me their digital service has been acting up and the magazine that I purchased was declined from the gift card.  They tried to charge it to my credit card but their system wont let them edit the payment.  They tried to rerun the gift card but it wont let them do that either.  They cant cancel it and cant reprocess it and the numerous hours Ive been on hold hasnt resolved the issue.  I wouldnt care about that but now my account from B u0026 N is frozen and I cant download any new material and I have books coming out later in the month that I want to own the day they come out.  They tell me theyre trying to fix it and to give them some time but I dont have time to be on hold hours at a time in order to see how theyre coming along with fixing the issue.  Im not saying not to buy this ereader. it is a good buy.  Just dont do it with you eyes closed.,4,1,2122
AVBCA0C2J4TQF,34,the tablet work perfectly and the battery life is so long that I recharge every 3 days and I only watch video. the down side of this is that has no keyboard language seetings .I watch japanese tv and I cant search for the tv shos names. and has no copypaste options in web.One other thing. if you are not from USA or Canada. you cant buy or even download free apps .you have to purchase a credit card and only allow this 2 countries.. I hope an upgrade software may solve this.,4,1,477
AVBKFDUQY2ZJ5,11,Purchased this item for my husbands birthday.  Charge it as indicated for 3 + hours and it would not turn on.  Contacted customer service at Barnes and Noble and asked for help but they were unable to do anything.  So have to wait to hear back from the company I bought it from for a return and then see if I can get a replacement that works.  Very disappointed in this product.,1,0,378

AVFEJXMSAXC08,1,I have had the same experience as many of the other reviewers on this forum. pixelation and freezeup.  I have had mine for less than one year and it has now failed for the third time.  Panasonic is absolutely no help  and will not recognize that they have a faulty product.  I will never  purchase any of their products based on the service I have received,1,0,356
AVGJ535HCHYO1,2021,I purchased the 3DFX Voodoo3 3500 TV and had a number of problems getting it to work. It would shut down and I had to repeatedly reload drivers etc. After SIX MONTHS of this. I was told by a 3DFX tech that the Voodoo 3 3500 TV. in fact all of the Voodoo 3 line. are not compatible with Tyan .among others. motherboards. It seems that the Voodoo3 3500 needs 3.3 volts to operate. and Tyan and other motherboard manufacturers products only supply 2.1 volts AGP!!!,1,0,461

AVHSBBA9WCUSX,0,This does not charge your Garmin.  It only provides power to the GPS.  DO NOT buy this if you are expecting it to charge your battery in your GPS.  My battery steadily lost power as it was plugged into this device. The seller was great though and refunded my money without me even asking and obviously mistakes can happen.  Just make sure your device charges if that is what you are looking to buy.,1,0,398
AVI1JPY8LOU8Q,67,I was so excited about get a GPS. was a while to set up the GPS to download everything. go to go on a trip and it didnt work.  It wouldnt turn on.  Sending it back with wanting a full refund.Thank you much.Margie,1,0,212

AVJ7MYQZJGN4X,0,Its a charge kit and the quailty is questionable at best meaning it feels flimsy. however it does do the job.,3,0,109
AVLWZUZ594UT4,0,I bought this at the same time I bought the Kindel Fire HD 7. It is exactly as pictured. the fit was great. and the price was right. The reason for the 4 stars is the cut outs for the volume and power buttons are on the edges of case but the actual buttons are located on the back of the Kindel. You cant access either button while the case is on. Apparently when Kindel upgrades a tablet they dont change the name or add a number to it like Apple does with the iPad. I went back and searched for clues in the description that this was for a different version Kindel and did not find anything. If you want a decent case and you dont want to pay a lot for it. this is the one but just make sure its designed for the HD 7 Kindel version you are buying.,4,1,750
AVMCNI18NGBWA,0,These headphones have good range and sound quality .nothing phenomenal. but more than adequate..  Would have rated it 5 stars. but for one ergonomic issue.  The tuning knob on the headphone set itself .you tune it  to work with the base station. is very easy to accidentally turn  thereby  knocking it out of commision.  Within the first week of using them. Ive  already had to retune several times .only takes a few seconds. but its  annoying..,4,1,445
AVMGFQ9FQOLYW,1416,I bought this mouse 8 years ago. In the last couple months. the right mouse button has been becoming unresponsive. and nothing I do seems to be able to get it back on track again. Now. were talking 8 years here. Ive gotten more than the USD70 I paid for it back then out of it in that time.Pros.ErgonomicPrecise controlDoesnt need a mouse pad. or even the desk space needed to move a regular mouse aroundNo moving partsLasted me 8 years!Cons.Your hand is right on the ball. so any dirt on your hands gets deposited. It is really painless to clean. though. just take out the ball and blowing inside will get most of the work done. Its designed so none of the dirt will actually get inside the components of the mouse.Fourth mouse button not recognized as a fourth button by games. must be assigned to a key.Takes a little getting used to. a couple days at the most. like the transition from a straight keyboard to one of those u0026quotnaturalu0026quot keyboards.Logitech doesnt actually make it anymore  they make a wireless version. which I will NEVER used due to a bad experience with a logitech wireless keyboard and mouse dropping keystrokes and movements a mere inches from the wireless receiver.,5,1,1201
AVN9JF83M2IQ4,45,I purchased this charger with a Garmine GPS .as recommended by Amazon.. It is either defective or wont work with this GPS. I bought the correct one elsewhere!,1,0,158

AVS4OQTZY8MEX,0,I loooove the small size!  Because of that. it gets more use.  HOWEVER. had to send it for repairs 3 months after I bought it.  Warranty covered the expense. .but not the shipping.. and Im afraid of the next time it will break. since the warranty has now run out.  I would recommend some other brand with a better repair history.  I dont recommend purchasing extended warranties. since its damn near impossible to make them pay.,4,1,428

AVTZAKQ999MDE,0,Although I am not conclusive. I believe this brush cleaner to be the most effective.  I have had many other disc based .insert. disc cleaners. none are as effective.  Hint. store disc in case with brushes facing up and before you use blow out the dust.  Also has anyone had troubles with DVD players not lasting more than a year with little use. with the unit kept near or next to the cable box?,4,1,395
AVU1JHAKDGRH3,22,Anyone considering buying a portable MP3 player please consider. MiniDisc is better!!!  Better quality. cheaper .740 minutes of music for USD20 opposed to 60 minutes for USD100.. and you can just as easily transfer MP3s to  MiniDisc.MP3 players are not worth your hard earned money because.  I  dont care what anyone says near CD quality means. not CD quality.  32  megs is the maximum storage on a card and it costs you almost USD100.  If  you enjoy paying USD100 to listen to 5 songs over and over again. fine.    Most players are not Mac compatible besides most dont even a use USB  interface.  Most players are manufactured poorly.  If you dont want a  product that will break  wait until respectable companies like JVC make  MP3 players.get a MiniDisc player!,1,0,764
AVU6DWTTYWOO2,1,The Palm V. which I own for about couple of months is very good if you know what its for and how you can use it best. However. if you think it is a multimedia device. or if you think it is the ultimate gaming machine etc.  youll be disappointed. It is great for carrying your address book.  scribbling a reminders on the road. playing small games when you have some  spare time .mostly on a bus or train. and reading Emails offline. The best  thing about it is its ultra portability.  Unmatched by any other device .so  far.. you can practically carry it anywhere you go. It may be viewed as  your personal companion. In the chain of computing gadgets. you can have a  desktop PC. notebook. handheld. Palm V. Before I bought it. I thought about  the Casio E100 .color with 65k color multimedia device.. however. I knew it  was much bulkier and therefore it would mostly be in my briefcase rather  than my pocket or hand .it is between the handheld and the Palm V. so it  can be in addition to the Palm V if you have extra cash.. I suggest  however. 3 improvements that can be the u0026quotkiller appu0026quot for 3COM. 1.  Increase the 2 MB to 8MB and leave the price almost intact .which we know  can be done.. 2. Add recording feature if possible within its size and 3.  Add the QuickNote app. as a standard to the device .for hand written  notes.. The price of the Palm V is nearing USD300. In 6 months I believe it  will be about USD250 and if those 3 improvements are added  it will be a  real winner.,5,1,1506
AVVDACUPQFM8P,33,I wasnt sure about this cord as i have many that say the same thing but with this cord right out of the package looked quality and IS as good as the original Samsung cord i received with my phone My phone recognizes on my computer with this cord and i have not had any trouble yet.I recomend this to anyone that needs a good replacement cord,4,1,341
AVVFMZTW94F8,0,Ordered this to use with my Nook Simple Touch. The price was right and it shipped fast. Its pretty lightweight and has a good build quality.

AVWH4749M8DT7,12,Great cover but you have to be careful with the magnetic fastener.  I flipped this open and accidently scratched the screen on my new nook.

AVZ3QDAB0KKWF,44,It does the job and looks good. but it does have a few deficiencies. It could close better. I use some clear tape to make sure it stays shut. but that might simply be because I have about 12 cords going through it. So it could also better accommodate a greater number of cables. If you have few cables then this could be for you. Sticks well to the bottom of my wall and keeps everything organized. Also it could be longer to be really useful. but again it works as is.,4,1,469

AVZYHYDNK9QKX,3536,Because the Nook Simple Touch runs Android .albeit with most signs of it covered up.. it can be rooted to allow the installation of Android apps. Opera Mobile allows for web browsing various RSS readers make keeping up with the news a cinch Mango provides more manga than I can ever hope to read you can even install Amazons Kindle app for Android! There are limitations. of course. Rooting the Nook .via Nooter.. while not difficult. does require some level of computer knowhow. The Simple Touch does not have any sort of audio output. and the eink screen cant handle video.  Still. having nearinstant access to news. weather. email. books. comics. and most websites makes the Nook Simple Touch a great little device. especially if you can find one used.,5,1,755

AW3G0D91IG596,3030,This visor folio is great for carrying cds on the go.  It saves so much space because you dont have to carry around 20 jewel cases.  It also is smaller than the cd wallets or bigger cases.  The only flaw I found was  that it was a little bulky to fit up in the cars visor. If you have less  cds to carry around. Id suggest the 10 cd visor holder.  Other than that  this product is great.,4,1,387

AW4TVY4188N9V,22,For the price I paid for this it wasnt worth it!!! Every time I put it in the USB port it would come off the Mickey chain.  Not very happy at all with the product or the cost I paid for it to do something like that..,1,0,216
AW4ZR3T63NCP0,0,Needed a CB for a Jeep Jamboree and will likely only need it once or twice a year. Perfect for this radio. Price is right. easy install. good for a Jeep where theres 0 room for full size perm CB. Did a perm antenna install. ran the coax just to the right of the console. keep the cb in the center console and pull it out when I need it. Cant speak for the portable performance but as an incar cb. its perfect for occasional use.,4,1,428
AW63SSBEX0LT6,0,Absolutely loves it!  My friend truly  enjoys having the books all the time to read. and his Simple touch keeps the charge  longer than my Nook tablet. I have my Tablet but eventually I will get just the simple touch. Thank you very much.,5,1,238
AW7XT4SBEPD4Z,0,it is cool was not what i was expecting. i use it everyday. i can not put it down. i love it.,4,0,93
AW8BNJ9TOUCC7,0,If you dont really care about precision dont bother reading.  The Turbo Mouse. despite its name. is another kensington trackball.  Its not as pretty as the orbit .just gray. but it is far superior to ANY trackball on the market and it has 4 buttons. After having to leave my old Turbo Mouse with a former employer I tried several cheaper substitutes .FYI. Macally products are nearly useless. but ended up spending the loot on the Turbo Mouse.  Check it out...take apart your trackball and look at the guts. The ball rests on low friction surfaces right?  Look closely now. they may try to fool you.  The turbo mouse is the only trackball Ive found that rolls on bearings.  Smoother than a babys...uh....frictionless surfaces.  Oh... dont even get me started on optical trackballs...have you ever tried to use PhotoShop with an optical trackball?  Its like painting with mud.  But if you just use Word and EMail ignore me...don,2,0,927
AW8BNJ9TOUCC7,66,I use a QPS Que .that I must say is a piece of junk. and have found that  when I burn audio on Memorex products they will not play in any of my CD  players except the DVD in my Mac.  I never had any problem with Fujis so  Im switching back. if I can find them.,1,0,260
AW8T8MJTWSD08,34,I bought this lock for my son to take to college to help protect his new MacBook Pro laptop.  It was unbelievably simple to use.  Plus. I love that you can register your key number online and my son can order another key from the company if he loses both of the keys he currently has.  Good quality.  For the money. this is a great buy!!,5,1,337
AW8YACI7RNNC,22,The DVD player is great.  Perfect midrange player. with a good mix of features vs. price.  Did notice a lipsync problem with one DVD. but it has not occurred in the past month or two. but I shall keep watching for  it.If you get this DVD player. you will not be disappointed.,5,1,275
AW90C3YRHB3TG,33,I absolutely would not recommend putting any TV you want to keep intact on this mount.When I pulled the mount out of the box. there was rust already present on the joint for the mounting face. It wasnt too bad. so I figured I would continue with installation.I managed to get the mount installed .mostly. and hoisted my TV upon the mount fairly easily. I will commend the mount for being easy to set up. even with attaching a large TV by myself.After getting the TV on there. I immediately noticed it had tilted severely. I took the TV off and went to tighten one of the bolts into the wall that I had forgotten to secure completely. Quarter of a turn into tightening this bolt. it sheered. This bolt was not even tightened all the way against the wall yet.,1,0,757
AW90FRYNFNN5N,1,Recd item in good order.  New in the box item.  No problems with seller or shipping. but the Kindle itself seems to be cheap quality.  Flickers when going from one page to another.  No back lighting so you must have a light on when reading.  It is lightweight and easy to hold compared to an IPad. but knowing what I know now I would have bought another IPad.,2,0,359
AW9QJWCQ79J7W,12,This cable is insanely cheap and does everything you could possibly need. I needed a cable long enough to run around the outside of my room and this was perfect. I was pleasantly surprised by the cost and have had not a single problem with it. Purchase without hesitation.,5,1,272

AWA1NJNP74GJ7,11,While the Voodoo3 2K is a good 3d accelerator. 3dfx has lost its edge.  They used to make up for the degraded image quality .compared to the TNT and other chipsets. with better speed. but theyve now lost the edge on  speed as well.  Check out all the benchmarks and quality analysis of the  TNT2 Ultra vs. Voodoo3 AGP at ..... and youll see what I  mean.The TNT2 .Ultra. installs flawlessly under Windoze .a miracle in  itself. and I virtually hotswapped it into my Linux system with no  problems at all.  I can play Q3A. HalfLife. and Q2 at 1024x768 with no  thrashing whatsoever.  I can even play in 32bpp at that resolution.  completely smoothly...  and the Voodoo3 cant manage that *at all*.Advice.  quit defaulting to 3dfx just because theyre 3dfx.  Theyve  been riding on their laurels for so long .the V3 is almost exactly the same  as the V2 except for a little speed boost  again. see Toms Hardware.  that Riva blew right past them in the 3d accelerator market. where they  used to dominate everyone in sight.  If you buy 3dfx. you send a message  that you dont mind if they sit back and stop innovating.  If you buy TNT2  this time. you send 3dfx a message to get off their butts.  Face it...  youre going to wind up buying a new card in a couple of years anyway. so  you might as well go with whos best today. and see what happens tomorrow.,3,0,1351
AWAK2ESH0MCTA,2434,I bought a pair of these 2way radios for my long distance move.  I used them throughout the entire trip. and they were pretty useful.  I dont really have a problem with the button in the middle. but it is kind of in the way.  Good clarity when you are in the clear.  When I tested it in New York City. I was able to get about 6 blocks before the signal was completely lost.  For the casual user though. I would go for the less expensive model though.,4,1,450
AWBUA3QUM6DRY,44,This a good fast P+S zoom camera in many situations. It does have AFAE lock. which is almost the only form of real exposure control it has. There are some other nice options though. including fill flash. infinity lock .landscape.. macrocloseup. continuous shooting. flash off. night scene. redeye offon. The zoom is fast and not too loud. it starts up quickly. recharges the flash moderately quickly. has a pretty fast .f3.5 on the 28mm end.. sharp and CONTRASTY lens for this type of 35mm camera. Ive gotten some beautiful images from it already .bought it used at Amazon a few weeks ago.with little effort. partially due to having the wide sharp lens and partially due to the ease of use and good centerweighted metering. Itd be nice if it went to 85mm or so. but then it would probably have to be a little more complex. slower. and heavier. so why burden the design? The lens is a little distorted .pincushion. on the edges at 28mm. so watch that when photographing buildings. Also remember that itll always default to flash ON mode after restarting. though it maintains the flash OFF mode while on if you set it that way.I prefer flash OFF most of the time. so I wish it had a Personal settings mode like the Canon z90w and Sure Shot 120. but thats NOT in the package..,4,1,1273
AWCGZ1FBZTYII,22,The speaker didnt work when I got it from Amazon. I decided to call the vendor for help. After waiting for about 30 minutes. I finally got a technical woman to answer my call. She confirmed the speaker is defective because there is no sound even if the lights of both transmitter and  speaker are on.. I returned it to Amazon.BTW. I bought Accurian AWS1475 wireless speacker at RadioShack for about USD99. Its more expensive but its crystal clear and extremely easy to be setup . less than five minutes and you dont need to tune it! .. Too bad. Amazon doesnt carry it.,1,0,568
AWDPAXS3VHD0O,77,This is a good product for less money and it works but remember to tune it in right and fool with it!!! Takes maybe a week but once you get it tuned right I got over 150 ft reception. Now here is my tip...the headphones are just OK so I got a new Sony wireless 900 MHz RF 945RK hoping it would be better the headphones are  but the Sony base does not work as well as the Advent so I just tuned my Sony headphones to the Advent base I get over 300 feet reception and have driven off with headphones on down the street..and they still receive over 300500 feet amazing.Go with Advent base and Sony headphones ... or at least try it somehow they match well...go figure.SKI,4,1,668
AWEXS2INCGM73,23,Although I do agree that the case offers good protection for the Pam V. I find it overpriced and cheaplooking.Really. the  case is made out of black plastic. with two thin sheets of aluminum covering front and back. At  least in my unit. the spring which is supposed to hold the cover closed is  so weak that I can hardly notice it. This adds to the overall cheap  feeling.For the USDUSD. I would by it again and give it 3 stars as a decent way  to protect my Palm while travelling. As it stands. I think the case is not  worth it and certainly does not add a stylish look.,1,0,573
AWF9F3X35WN2I,1114,Ive tried a lot of headsets in the below USD25 category and this is best for sound quailty.With other headsets either I sound muffled or the person I am talking to is too quiet or muffled. With the Uniden I can hear people clearly and they can hear me perfectly. Most people dont even know Im on a headset. Some of the reviewers have had problems with the microphone but in all Ive had 5 of these and have never had a microphone problem. .I have three phones that use headsets..I will agree that they can break easily but I found a fix for that  the headband has a weak point where it extends for larger heads.  I just put tape around that point so it cant extend and not one has broken since. Ive rated this 4 instead of 5 stars because of having to tape it so it wont break.,4,1,776
AWG3DNS7L9QNS,1010,Good sound. reasonable price. Would recommend this product to anyone who does not need an extra long cord.,5,0,106
AWG3H90WVZ0Z1,12,Everything works as described. but I give these a 4 star rating due to the uncomfortable earpiece. All else works well. and I cannot complain.,4,1,142
AWG4ZGKERDT7J,0,I would have given this item 5 stars. except I should have looked closer and buy the longer cable as it would have been more convenient.,4,1,136
AWGHENJ0HPG2G,0,This is a nice sounding deck. but the tape transport is cheap and unreliable. I had mine for about a year. and the left well started eating tapes. I finally took it to a repair shop. When I got it back it worked for a week then it ate one of my favorite tapes. I would not recommend this deck.,2,0,293
AWHJSHKVPD7WE,1010,Ive owned this unit for several years. as a truck driver I can say its held up better than me.It has a standard NEMA 2.0 interface output. so most quaility mapping programs will accept the data.Its small size makes it very portable. and battery powered is a plus. Ive found that 2400mAh rechargable AA work well over a day. not using the power saving feature.And its actually gone up in value since I bought it !!Ive seen a lot of the newer GPSs on the market. havent seen a reason to get one of them. The Garmin 12 will download and upload waypoints and all the rest. you just have to search for the software on the internet.,5,1,626
AWHMJN7NVPBM1,22,I just got the 821. and it is the best gadget I have ever bought. It is so much better than a mp3 player because the sound quality is better and each minidisc is about USD2.00 to USD5.00. for 74 min. A memory card for 32MB is at  least USD50. Once you know how to use the 821 its so easy. With a digital  output the sound quality is AWESOME! And it does not skip at all. If i  kept on going about everything that is good about the 821. I would never  stop. This Minidisc playerrecorder is AWESOME. thank you Amazon.com,5,1,518
AWHOFZW0WRUJD,1313,This cleaner was my third attempt to clean my old xbox drive. It sounds exactly like the radio shack cd but it has more bristle tufts.it has eight. that are placed about an inch apart around the inner ring of the cd and each tuft has lots of bristles compacted together in an area about as big as a pen tip. After blasting my lens with compressed air.with no effect.i ran this disk and my game ran for about an hour  with no skips before freezing. Its probably my thompson drive being shoddy and not this product.,4,1,513
AWID7RV8FFDVC,0,Although the first one did not work they paid for shipping and replaced the unit with a working model of which I am most satisfied. I plan to do business with this company again.,5,0,178
AWIIUZL712FFH,0,As someone that has tried the more expensive Bose noise cancelling headphones. I can honestly say that the Maxell NCII are well worth the money.  I recently wore these headphones with relatively high expectations. and feel that they performed well for the money spent.You can tell that these headphones feelappear made inexpensively  lots of plastic components.  Take care of them. and they should last.  Dont forget to grab a couple AAA batteries. as they are not included.,4,1,474
AWJM1UINK3UF3,67,I had every intention of loving this product. however I returned it immediately!  The setup was way too complicated.  If you have ever experienced the ease of an iPad. this will make you feel like you have gone back in time.  I am going to look into the newer Nook and Kindle and see if they have improved the product.,1,0,318
AWKA50N9DHLCZ,12,Worst product ever.Made to be disposable. Within the first year I had it replaced twice.Third one still sucks but at least it hasnt gone completely black on me.You are able to surf the internet and look on pinterest with it but I dont suggest it because it will keep freezing or shutting down the internet on you.It should only be used to read books and not be used as a tablet. If you want a tablet stick with a Kindle or iPad.,1,0,428
AWKWTKF1D4Y3Q,1,i saved hundreds of dollars on all my scratched cds by using this product!!!,5,0,76
AWL0JAXP3LQWJ,22,I bought this to protect my Nook HD at work and it is a tough little case. I like that it has the clips instead of soft ridges and it snaps around the shell of the Nook perfectly.,4,1,179
AWLTC8WTM4HV0,0,Complete waste!!! Took the whole day to charge my Nexus. Look elsewhere for a cable replacement. This is not the one for you.,1,0,125
AWM1GESO0M7ML,66,Had a Rio PMP300 player for about a week. It is tiny. battery life is excellent compared with other portable music solutions and there are no moving parts so it doesnt skip. The upload sofware is intuitive. I was up  and running in a couple of minutes. I havnt looked at the packaged CD  rippingencoding software as I prefer to use my own software to do this. As  to the qualitymemory size issue. if you play a song recorded at 128kpbs  and then play the same song at 64kbps you will notice the difference.  However I couldnt really say that one is better than the other. in terms  of sound quality. The 128kpbs version is of course closer to the original  CD if that is what is meant by better quality. Id say its nothing that  cant be corrected with equilisation. If you played two dissimilar songs.  one encoded at 64kbps and one at 128kpbs Im not sure I could reliably tell  you which was which. In short the difference isnt enough for me to care.  At 128kbps. the play time is about 30 minutes. at 64kbps it is about 60  minutes. If you want 60 minutes play time. Id try a 32Mb player first then  if you care about the 128kbps issue buy a 32Mb Flash card upgrade. Simple  as that.,4,1,1185
AWM2XN8BG9DTZ,55,This is the color Nook. As I already have a Kindle2 and an iPad2. I bought this for my husband because I kept hearing about how wonderful it is. He didnt care for it. and so I experimented with it myself. If I hadnt used the Kindle and the iPad so much. I might have agreed that the device offers a good user experience. I have. however. and this device in no way stacks up to the other two devices. The Kindle beats it cold as a reading device in my opinion. As for being in any way anything like the iPad. it simply isnt. Also. its controls dont seem as responsive as those on the other devices. Im sure someone wanting a decent ereader that offers color at less cost than the iPad might find it okay. but I was disappointed.,3,0,727
AWMGLN4BEWIN,45,I wish I could review this product. but the product didnt work right out of the box.

AWO7V8RR26RMX,36,I bought 25 of these for my work so we can lock down our laptops while at the client site.  The product is good. minus the fact you can only set the lock code once.  I already had a coworker forget his code after 1 day. so we had to scrap that lock.,4,1,249
AWPBUWAAI8EA1,0,This is a very good drive at an inexpensive price and I recommend this drive to anyone. it worked in true PlugandPlay fashion with no problems whatsoever does everything I require and it arrived quickly.,4,1,203
AWPDZWM0XL896,0,picked up two sets in liquidation for a big USD20 each. and while they are pretty much as bad as decribed elsewhere. I will probably find some use in the future. such as the deck.I would be royally pd off if I had purchased them at retail price.My own main issue with them is that they are entirely unsuitable for an iPod. Whenever the audio signal goes off  such as after a playlist ends  the emitter stops broadcasting after a brief delay.Then all hell breaks loose as the speakers emit a loud chirpandscreech noise. on and off. A nice way to wake up in the middle of they nigh. if you like to fall alseep to some music...,2,0,624

AWQRBTR4T8URB,66,I bought these in the second week of February.  Today is April 3 and the right headphone is already on its deathbed.  If I fiddle with the cord. I can get it to work. at least until it dies out again.  Its an endless cycle of fiddling with the cord over and over again. only to have the right speaker die out again and again.  I finally give up.  Ive read other reviews where the same thing happened. so its not like it was an isolated incident.Any headphones that cant even last 2 months are not worth your money.  Needless to say. I will not buy any Maxell headphones ever again and I suggest you dont either.,1,0,611
AWQXW4U9U9M3G,2528,I am rating it a 0. It did not work. Plugged it in to the USB port and nothing happened. Very disappointed. Tried a different computer. No difference.,1,0,150

AWSB9ON5HN6DO,0,Why would you spend USD350 for a remote??  If you own a Home Theater System and are losing your mind with a u0026quotjungleu0026quot of buttons. you will want to spend the USDUSD on this one!  Great flexibility. very intuitive  interface. huge support of devices .training it to mimic unknowns is also  very easy..  One complaint. the LCD legibility could be improved!,4,1,368
AWWBZZXN32I6H,33,Im not brutal with equipment. but in a few short weeks. the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side. Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep. A second convenient bedside charger would be nice. I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge. If youre a  late night TV watcher. you too might call this justifiable laziness. Too many times I put them on the next night and find the batterys down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless. Id find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone.,1,0,853

AWZS4O03NGRYG,0,Yoiu have to log onto their servers to read your purchased and downloaded producvt. If you are unlucky enough to try to read your purchase while their servers are being maintained you cant read it and are told to try again an hour later. I bought a book for my daughter. who needed to read it right away for school. Obviously not being able to didnt go very well. They dont seem to have any server maintenance problems on their online store. but of course they are trying to get your money then. Once they have your money you can wait. If they can keep their online store servers running without maintenance delays. they should do the same with the servers you have to log on to to access your product.,1,0,702

AX035XUDFGQ8L,0,I have seen what DVDs look like when played on notebook computers. and you cant beat the Panasonic player.  The picture is so good. you forget you are watching the movie on a small screen.  It is a must have for all you  technophiles and toy lovers.  You will be the envy of all your fellow  travellers with this machine....  The only things I wish could be changed  on the machine are the sound and the lack of an adapter for the car and  plane.  The 3 hour battery is great. but what about for those longer trips?  Not all of us can afford the Concorde to Europe and back.  ..  I was  expecting better sound after reading how Panasonic went on about the  superiority of it in the ad. but it just isnt so.  However. with a good  pair of headphones. you forget the regular speakers.  It does heat up. but  so do a lot of notebook computers when you use the CD ROM or DVD players in  them.  I stand firmly by my 5 star rating.,5,1,925
AX0GYTA8JSUEK,44,I four wheel a lot and all of the guys I go with have the Cobra version of this Midland. I wish I would have bought the Cobra. The Midland has a short range and when I am within a block of another CB it cuts out and I can only hear static which is bad when on the trail. I took it to a CB shop and they said there was nothing they could do with this CB. With the Cobra version the CB shop modifies them to be more powerful. None of the guys I wheel with have had any trouble with their Cobra. Buy the Cobra...,1,0,509
AX1576OM5IYZJ,12,Having used the 4109X for the past six months. I must say that Im disappointed with the product and would recommend buying from a different manufacturer.  .Ive heard that Onkyo makes these for Toshiba. so watch out  for their products as well!.First. the good.  Picture quality is  fabulous. and so is sound reproduction.  The u0026quotenhanced blacku0026quot  mode makes the picture especially rich while colors remain vibrant.  The  carousel feature is great. especially if you have kids  you can jump from  Tarzan to Pocahontas without putting the baby down .and without letting  your older ones put fingerprints all over your discs!.Now for the bad.  1. The 4109 gets confused when switching from CDs to DVDs. and Ive  frequently had to shut it down and restart to get discs to play.  2.  Sometimes it thinks its playing a DVD even thought its not. and at those  times it wont let me swap a disc out of the carousel. .Ive heard a number  of other users complain about these same functional items. so Im sure its  not just my unit that has problems.. 3. The carousel may be quiet. but the  unit itself hums loudly during playback.  This is very annoying if you  dont have your unit in a closed cabinet. 4. The remote is HORRIBLE.  True.  it is loaded with features. but the layout is illogical and the small  buttons are not friendly to anyone with normalsized fingers.  Plus. it  lacks backlighting  just try finding those tiny function buttons in the  dark. 5. The lack of random multidisc playback is annoying. but can be  overcome by programming the tracks you want to hear.  .And no. its not  because the machine cant distinguish between CDs and DVDs as someone wrote  below. as the machine does have a u0026quotCD onlyu0026quot mode that ignores  DVDs during playback..With its great picture quality. this could easily  have been a fivestar product.  Adjusting for Toshibas spotty quality  control and that darned remote. it only gets three.  As such. Id probably  go with the 3disc Pioneer or the 5disc Sony instead.,3,0,2026
AX1RFLN8PF58P,4547,the review you put with this product describes another midland radio. the  74200.  the 74105XL does not have a cb channel. nor does it have a  display to show the time. date and type of emergency claimed in your  writeup.  however. I have used this radio in Canada and it is effective  for emergency notification and is still a good product at this price.

Thats what makes this card good   its one of the lower priced cards from a respected industry  vendor.Tulip cards are known for their low CPU utilization. high  throughput and their ability to run on a variety of platforms.  I have  personally used this card with great success on Linux. FreeBSD. Solaris  x86. Windows 95. 98. and NT.I did dock one star however. and thats  because their have been some minor problems with the drivers included on  the driver diskettes.  Those seem to have been fixed with subsequent  releases. and the card itself wasnt to blame.  If you do have problems.  and you can use one of the other Tulip drivers included with your OS. such  as the Digital DE500.  In fact. Windows may autodetect it as an u0026quotIntel  21140 Fast Ethernetu0026quot or some such.,4,1,1052
AX5RBYRIBA9T,4345,I originally purchased this card with the intent to boot into Windows 98 to play games and stay in NT 4.0 for everything else.  I made a mistake by jumping the gun and assuming I could at least run regular 2D video on NT .I  didnt expect it to be able to play games on it in NT..  Well. it doesnt.  The best it does is 16 color 640x480 using the Standard VGA driver. since  the 3dfx drivers wouldnt install or even provide regular 2D  functionality.Worse. the Win98 installation originally had a regular  Voodoo 3 3000 in it. and I found that not only could I not install the  Voodoo 3 3500 drivers under Win98. I could no longer reinstall the Voodoo  3 3000 after I removed the 3500 card and replaced it with the 3000.After  reformatting and reinstalling Win98. the card did work but the TV tuner  didnt work too well unless it had a direct cabletv coax feed.  In other  words. I was unable to watch Nebraska football games at work on Saturdays  because the tuner wasnt good enough to pick up a signal despite having a  powered RCA antenna I had purchased for it.The card itself is only a bit  faster than a Voodoo 3 3000. so this card is hard to recommend unless  youll only be running Windows 98 or are willing to experiment with 3dfxs  beta quality Windows 2000 drivers.  Youd also be better off with nVidias  card in this generation. a TNT2.As of this writing .March 2000.. there  are newer generation cards available which are better.  An nVidia GeForce  256 powered card .i.e. Creative Labs Annihilator or a Guillemot 3D  Prophet.. and the older nVidia TNT2Ultra .i.e. a Diamond Viper V770  Ultra..  There are also Voodoo 4 and 5 cards coming in May 2000.,3,0,1662
AX5TLW1LINB45,1414,I ordered this and it came right on time and works great only problem is that it came in all white. Pic shows all black which I preferred. Obviously. not a problem with function so I kept it but was kinda bummed when I opened it to find it as white.,4,1,249

Sharp labeled this model. but it was built by Vadem  as well.  For less money. you can get twice the memory. twice the speed and  better graphics.,5,1,661

AXCIN2MJXQTG8,0,My friend has this card on his 800mhz and it runs great with unreal tournement and madden 2000.

AXGS6XWH8CSSA,1313,I purchased this product used.  The problem there is that it was registered to someone else.  When I tried to do a factory reset I would have needed the previous owner to call Barnes and Noble help line to ok me reset.  I got around that by doing some research online and found a way around registering the device.  This made the device usable. but no applications could be downloaded through the Barnes and Noble web site because you have to link your nook with your account.  I was using it as a reader for a while. but decided to add the cm7 mod.  After installing cm7 on it. this tablet is turning out to be a great buy.  cm7 is not the most stable. at least not the version I installed. but it is better than the stock nook software.,4,1,738
AXHL9802GBY0H,33,I have owned this DVDCD drive for less than six months and it already doesnt work. I ve only used it to download cds onto my computer so that I have a wide variety of music in my i tunes. SOOOOOOO lame. Six months. really? I barely used it. USD31.00 down the drain.,1,0,265
AXI0KE90R1U5I,0,I was a little scared to get this. as I had a Kindle Fire .3 actually. that I had to return because they refused to work. I got this instead. and I love it!!! It navigates so much more smoothly. and there is anti glare on the screen. The touch screen works on a touch. the first touch every time! Ill have to update my review later because I fell in love the moment my first book uploaded. which is further than the Kindle ever got. Im very happy with this product though. Unlike the Kindle. this comes with the USB cord to connect to the computer...and instructions. Set up was super smooth also!!!,5,1,599
AXIHPPNW6JI9A,22,The cable appeared to work ok with a Play Station 3 when using games. however when I used the PS3 as a blue ray movie player the image on the HDMI TV shows horrible interference .white noise..I tested 3 TVs. Toshiba. Panasonic and Sony Bravia. one of them reproduced the movie with noise. the other 2 did not even recognize the video playback and presented a source not available error.All I did was replace this cable with one i purchased in the supermarket and it worked for all 3 TVs.,1,0,487
AXJEHSJIC84T8,1,This antenna did not work at all for me. I only received 1 channel and that was full of snow. The antenna is not made very well.

I would choose a different brand.,2,0,352

AXSDEAWIE0IIK,13,My Kindle broke and I replaced it with an extremely cheap Nook.  Since then I have been extremely disappointed.  I only expect three things out of an ereader and was shocked to learn that the Nook fails on two of the three counts.1. The actual reading.They both do the job.  In fact. I slightly prefer the Nook to the Kindle in terms of form. ease of reading. and the presence of a physical button.2. Wifi Connectivity.What the **** is the point of having wifi if you can only use it for downloading purchases from Bu0026N.  I expect to practically NEVER make a purchase from the official store.  Instead I use an ereader for my personal files .textbooks and news articles for example. and am left having to connect the device to my computer every. single. time.  Unbelievable shortcoming of the Nook.3. SoftwareI cant see how far Ive read. I cant edit file names. AND WORST OF ALL I CANT DELETE???????????!!?!!?!?!!?!  wtf Bu0026N. wtf.This product is really just awful in comparison.  Annoying to say bc I was unhappy with Amazon in relation to what happened to my Kindle.Two stars because it does actually work. but that seems a bit generous...,2,0,1147
AXSE03URV39Z5,23,I have just bought my unit and I am really enjoying the excellent sound. I do agree that it should be easier titling the tracks. .I understand that its easier to do with the 722 model.. I use the 702 everywhere. biking. at the gym. in the car .with a CDtotape adaptor. and so on. So far I have  not had a single problem and I hope it stays that way. I am thinking about  getting an adaptor to plug it to the car. that way Id avoid using the  units battery so fast.,4,1,464
AXSJ7HPH3QPGR,33,A much better quality than staples brand of CAT 5E cables. Was easier to run inside a wall so the wires didnt show on the outside walls.,5,0,136
AXSKTR88A7ASK,0,Not only does this shower radio get great reception in the shower .after finding the right place for the included antenna.. but it has been helpful to have on hand during the spring storms weve had recently here in North Texas. When my satellite .TV. was knocked out during the storms. I could receive very clear reception of my local TV stations on this radio.  Unfortunately. the radios weather bands do not come in clearly  thats why only 4 stars.  But with sound from the live TV broadcast. I didnt need the weather bands.  I highly recommend it!,4,1,550
AXTPPOVT8JWWY,11,My wife recently went on a long US east coast driving trip by herself.  The handheld CB gave her that extra comfort level she needed when Cingulars cellular service nationwide service dropped out .quite often..  I highly recommend this unit for women .or men. travelling alone .or not!..  For the price. even if its NEVER used. its a good deal.  Id put it with your emergency roadside kit.  Every vehicle should have one of these!,5,1,430
AXV1XGHMKLL55,1417,This power cord works fine and the price was great. but I do not believe that it is a Belkin.  In my opinion it is just a cheap generic,3,0,135
AXVDXLCTFHLRG,23,This case was not what it was described to be. I did expect some wear but this was really fit for the scrap heap.It was dirty. overused and there were even cigarette.?. burns on the body. Yet it was advertised as being almost new. If this was my first order with Amazon there is no way I could have returned. Thankfully it was not.,1,0,331
AXVZ3MN2J0O3Z,16,I do not think this is a bad battery like all the other reviews have said. In fact I do not use it with a power sucking machine. but it works great for the device I use it for.,4,1,176
AXXAD76G1CMC5,0,I bought this on Tuesday and received it on Wednesday. I put it up and it only took about 20 minutes to install if you really read what the instructions say to do. This is holding my 43 samsung plasma. The only problem is on the arm I had to loosen the screw just a little for the rotation to move more smoothly. I would say this is a great product for the price and I would highly recommend this product!,4,1,405
AXXH31CVFTQSC,0,I have this card and a GeForce 256 .Creative And Gullimot both have cards. based card. and head to head the GeForce kills this card. Image Quality vs Speed. The GeForce 256 chipset runs away with the u0026quotperfectu0026quot blend  between beauty and Frames per Second. Most GeForce cards are around 250300  dollars. and they support 32bit color. Tu0026ampL support. OpenGL and D3D  .forget Glide. according to most software devolpers this is on way out.  because only one chipset supports it.. and as far as overclock ability. you  dont need to this card has a 256 bit processor. not a 128 like the voodoo  cards. This is simply my opion take it as such. I own both cards on two  exact machines. and i dont think the Voodoo 3 is worth the money for hard  core gamers.,2,0,769
AXYGT3CBHC1WA,3241,Ive used the Meade 07021 Deluxe Field Tripod 883 with my ETX90EC for over a year now and generally it has performed okay.  The tripod itself is made of a light aluminium material for the legs. so while this reduces weight for portability it seems a little light on solidity.  The locking screws which hold the extendable legs in place also seem a little flimsly.  Having said that however. I took notice of reviews prior to purchasing the tripod and never overtighten them and accordingly they have worked okay.  Suprisingly. it doesnt take much tightening of the screws to secure the legs.  I often expect the legs to slip down but they stay in place during extended viewing sessions.  The actual mounting plate and associated adjustment knobs all work fine and are manufactured to an acceptable standard.  The tripod has a three prong metal bracket which sits in the middle of the legs when the tripod is in position and which folds up with the tripod when stored.  This bracket is quite flimsy but has not failed yet.  There is a centre tray which is screwed to the centre of the bracket to give the tripod more stability and holds eyepieces etc.  This is manufactured okay.  Overall. I think the tripod could have been made sturdier and from better materials in some areas.  However. I have taken extra care with it. so I really cant complain as mine is still in good condition. I also think the tripod is somewhat overpriced. so look out for specials on it.  In summary its an okay tripod if you look after it and get it at the right price.,4,1,1545
AXYV3A1NFEM5M,55,I bought this product. I can tell that it continues to do wonders for the reputation of the brand. about the product itself its wonderful you can carry 10 diskettes very easy and safely. if you work with lots of disks  this is a product you should consider buying.AGAIN ITS GREAT,5,1,279
AXZQKTI9PRWTC,22,I purchased this from another site. but I wanted to clear up some misconceptions.  First. keep in mind any allinone models are going to have some limitations with the speaker and microphone.  That is just a small issue that I notice.Biggest thing I need to remind people is CB operates around 27 Mhz. which has a wavelength of around 36 feet.  If you are buying this hoping to get miles out of the included antenna. put your money away right now.  A short little antenna will NOT get you very good range.  All handheld antennas are designed for portability first. usefulness second.  There are some decent ones you can buy but they are still very limited by their size.If you intend to use this in a car you must buy and install an antenna in your car.  The included antenna is short enough as it is. using it inside a car will reduce your range to as little as a few feet.  Even a cheap magnet mount. properly tuned. will be an incredible improvement.  Please make sure also when plugged in to your car to keep the power to high.  This gives the full 4 watts allowed by law and 23 times the range as low.If you follow these guidelines this is a very versatile radio that is very rich in features for its size.  Dont let negative reviews from people who are obviously not familiar with installing and using a CB radio dissuade you from it.  If space is an issue andor you would like a handheld unit. this radio could be what you are looking for.,5,1,1445
AY0ABUXDAJ1FG,22,I was very pleased with both the comfortable fit and the sound quality of these reasonably priced  headphones.

AY207EKUVYROH,0,This cassette deck from Pioneer has very good sound quality when playing back professionally recorded tapes. The digital noise reduction circuit really cleans up the tape hiss and other sonic imperfections common to cassettes. Although. on some nonprofessional recordings or recordings that are severely detoriated it tends to add an edge to the hiss that it cannot fully remove. The unit that I used also had some reliability problems with the transport mecahanism. Pioneer was evidently unable to repair this altogether after a couple of trips to the repair shop. All in all. it is a very well performing product plagued by some annoying reliability concerns. It is the best sounding tape deck that I have used so far. Although. I am confident there are better ones out there.,3,0,778
AY2HPBN6O2BZF,1317,The whole reason I wanted to buy a PC cam in the first place was to talk to relatives and friends.  When I tried to install the cam. I ran into a few problems .like you usually do in most software the first time you install it. but the troubleshooting guide was helpful and I got it working.  The picture was satisfying. You can obviously tell who you are talking to.  My only real complaint is the resolution.  Its a little slow. in fact I can see myself blink on the monitor.  So if you want to get this cam just to chat with friends. I say buy it. its fairly cheap.  But if you want high quality data for experiments for example get something better.,4,1,653
AY2IJ1HYO5P2Z,23,Ive had this player for a few months now and it has worked flawlessly. I was concerned after reading some of the u0026quotbad pressu0026quot at Amazon and other sites but I read many reviews from trustworthy souces like etown.com  and Sound and Vision. as well as the many positive reader reviews and  decided to purchase it. That was a good decision.I finished my basement  .prewired for surround.. purchased a u0026quotbig screenu0026quot though my uncle  who works for Sony .I got an unbelievable family discount. and with the  Toshiba 3109 and Dolby Digital surround sound. my home theater is now  complete. Movies never looked or sounded so good. The picture is extremely  sharp and detailed. The sound is very impressive with the 5 discrete .+  Sub. channels. The enhanced black level feature really shows great detail  in the dark areas of the screen. I went out and bought The Matrix and it  was absolutely stunning on my Toshiba. This is said to be the  u0026quotbenchmarku0026quot movie as it is a good title to play to u0026quottest the  legsu0026quot of your player. Lesser machines are said to have problems with  this title as its bitrate is rather high. With the included bitrate meter  I was able to see just how much data the player was processing. Pretty  cool. and as I said. not even one glitch.This Toshiba has many added  features that are not always included in other players at this price point.  Although to be honest. I really do not use features like the 3power zoom  and HDCD compatablity and the dualtray is only moderately useful .the 2109  is the same player wo the u0026quotextrasu0026quot but USD100 less.. Even without  all those extra features though. the 3109 is a superb buy. The setup menus  are very easy to navigate and initial setup is a breeze. The remote however  leaves something to be desired as it is rather awkward and not well laid  out.With balancing family and career. It is nice to have a home theater  where you dont have to go through the hassle of findingpaying a  babysitter and even paying USD30 for 2 tickets. popcorn u0026amp drinks in order  to experiance a good movie. My kids love watching Disney DVDs at home and  it sure beats paying for them to see a movie 17 times as you know they love  to do. So. I figure my home theater should pay for itself in a couple  years.The 3109 has had a lot of play time between many  u0026quotgrownupu0026quot movies and DisneyBarneyBluesClues and not once has  it ever froze. u0026quotcrap outu0026quot or even hiccupped.  I work hard for my  money .as many of you do. and like to make my money go a long way. With the  Toshiba 3109. I definately got more than my moneys worth. Dont believe  all the u0026quotbadpressu0026quot out there because you will miss out on a  great DVD player. IMHO.,5,1,2789
AY2KPOBSDMH2K,2728,This item suggests that you can use it to hook up a Wii to the TV via HDMI connections.  There is no HDMI connect on the Wii and therefore all this is a HDMI connection cord.  It is a great HDMI connection cord. but not for the Wii.,1,0,232
AY2NE9ZEZ5LCE,88,I made a 4 day. 3 night solo hike in Big Bend National Park.  This device was far more valuable to me than a compass.  Even though it was dropped on the ground. briefly immersed in water and used often. it survived and told  me when I was u0026quotoff trailu0026quot and then gave me clear direction and  distance to my next goal.  I will never again hike without it.In my  automobile I find it fascinating and sometimes helpful.  On a trip recently  during icey road conditions. we were forced to make a detour onto small  backroads.  During the times when we were offhighway. we knew where we  were and the direction in which we needed to go.It was a great gift for  me to receive.,5,1,683

AY6A8KPYCE6B0,0,This cord works great and the length is just right for me. My only complaint is that the orange isnt quite as festive in person.

Orange is my favorite color. so I paid a little extra for it. but I wish I had just gotten one of the cheaper ones.,4,1,366
AY70J0NBHCJVP,1,The Blazer 12 is a userfriendly and ergonomically efficient tool for basic tracking and location information.  The altitude feature is also great if you are calibrating weather equipment.  Sure. you can spend USD50  more and get more bells and whistles. but this unit offers all the  essential information you need for basic urban and rural expeditions.  I  will have to admit I am fairly good at direction anyway. but this model  helps verify where I think I am.  Like any other gadget used for the novice  explorer. it is complimentary. but shouldnt be used as your last line of  defense.  If you need a GPS for IFR Flying or deep woods camping. buy one  of the really expensive downloadable map GPS.  But if you just want to  know where you are and where you are going. and where you have been...this  does all that for you.,4,1,827
AY7DFT8SJFSW,1010,I bought a PalmIIIx about 6 months ago and I have been very dissapointed.  Dont get me wrong... in principle the ability to store and beam addresses u0026amp business cards. manage my calander. securely store network passwords  is great!  When the unit was working I loved it.  However. after about  three months of ownership. I began loosing all my data at random  internvals. forcing me to revert back to my last sync with my computer. I  would turn the unit on and all my data was gone... evern with fresh  batteries.  Palm was not able to diaganise the problem... just telling me  to reset it again... duh.  The last time this happened the unit went  completely dead. It could be that I just had a bad unit.  However. I would  advise other Palm purchacers not to store any critical data on the unit. As  for me. I would not buy another Palm product.,1,0,853

There are visual graphics on the tape that talk you through the process u0026 you get a little chart that you can stick on the tape case which shows that you can get 100 uses out of it. Then just toss it out u0026 replace it. This cleaner really improves the AV quality on a VCR.,5,1,314

AY9A7XQCYDF9N,23,It can read maybe 1 in 20 floppy discs. I think I tried about 50 discs and it read three of them. But then when I put one of the ones that COULD be read back in. it could no longer read it. It simply wants to reformat every floppy disc you put in and does not have the ability to read disc with information already on them. It is simply a waste of money.,1,0,354

AY9QGJVGN3P67,27,I havent been able to understand why this product is getting decent reviews.  It is definitely not sturdy enough for the 32 inch LCD screen that I bought for my mom. the joints are too stiff to easily adjust the angle of the TV and the screen hangs awkwardly lower than mounting brackets because of the weak joints.  I am returning this.  A better option is a mount that has 2 stability points on the first arm .above and below stability. .....,1,0,444

AY9RP35SQR09O,22,I enjoy using this product for quality reproduction of fine music. I am a classical and rock music enthusiast and find the Maxell XLII ideal for recording quality sound. I consider the high bias feature of this tape to be essential for quality reproduction of the high treble and low base sounds of both classical and rock music. I cannot find this product in stores anymore. so I am glad I can get it through Amazon.,5,1,417
AYA7I42QTNBNN,0,My opinion is that the Rio player. along with most MP3 players. lack features that other types of players are capable of. One of these features that it lacks is that Rio has a lot of memory for a MP3 player these days.  and it can only play 2 HOURS of songs with its onboard memory. After that.  its USD100 for a 1 hour .32mb. flash card. With CDs and MDs. the hour is  for about USD3. Also. there are not many different models to choose from.  whoch is a drawback. There is also the problem of BATTERIES. Now. I have a  suckie CD player. so I only get 6 hours every 2 batteries. but some CD  players can accomnplish 50+ hours of CD playing on 2 batteries. 12 hrs1  battery is pretty much outragous .thats why I need a new CD player.. Wait a  couple years for better MP3 players. Untill then. I recommend a MiniDisc  System or A CD System. Much Better Value.,2,0,858
AYAAW7IL4JAXL,119,It does a great job on DVDs and CDs...sound and sight.....HOWEVER it can not play CDs that I have recorded from my other CDs.....where I have just my favorite numbers...so I had to purchase another CD player than has that capability........I wanted to save space......and in that it failed........so its 4 stars for performance......and 1 star for other features that were critical such as spacesaver,3,0,400

AYBGRRUKUNRH7,0,My lock seemed to be fine for the first few months.  Suddenly. once. it wouldnt come off my computer.  I checked the combination is correct .the button can be pushed only when the combination is correct.. however. the internal mechanism broke and the lock was permanently stuck to my computer.Again. mine was not a combination problem  it was an insoluble problem with the inner mechanism.

AYCQ4QSQNCLLV,0,I bought this for my car cd player. Its one of those that is installed in the trunk and holds 5 cds. The songs were skipping. So. I bought this u0026 tried it.

It didnt work in my case.,3,0,357
AYDTNYX38CUOI,0,If your are a home theatre buff like I am with all the right equipments. expensive or not. this is a good DVD player. It has all the features that  the high priced players have an some more. especially if you have a Dolby  Digital receiver.  The component output is excellent. the SVideo option is  just great. I am very pleased with this buy. although my rest of the  accessories are Kenwood. Bose and Proscan. this low priced player is just  great.,4,1,450
AYE4THHZDBI4P,1,There are a lot of really good and bad reviews for this product. but heres what i think.  If you have the common sense to read about what software this product supports then it will work perfectly.  You wont need any customer support because it takes all of 2 minutes to set up.  I was hesitent to buy it like you probably are. but if youre looking for a cheap. but really nice mp3 player. this is the one for you.  If you have windows NT dont get this player because it wont work.  If you have windows 95 or 98 like most of us do then this will work just fine.  Dont be scared. its definately worth it for the money.,4,1,617
AYEW66SBIK8JI,0,all in all the 722 is a great product and would have gotten five stars if  not for a few minor details.1.you can combine tracks but you cant  divide them or undo you last edit2.the cables that you get with it wont  fullfill all of your needs the composite cable has scratchy sound while the  digital opic cable had great sound but it couldnt connect to either of my  computers or any stereos so you have to get yourself a third  cable3.other people said in their reviews that the directions were a  little sketchy but they were only minutly bad4.unless you dont have  pockets you almost deffinitly wont use the hands strap but its just nice  to have5.when your first getting used to the remote controle you might  want to put hold on unless your activley pushing buttons because the  buttons are right where you would hold itall aside its a great product  and is worth the money,4,1,878

AYFRTINNY1LHO,1,I own one of the original Elf Jr.s .with the matt black body..  Ive carried this camera all over the US on vacations and everyday travel.  For compactness and ease of carry it cant be beat and one cant complain about  the features for the price.  The picture quality never fails to amaze me.  The APS system in the Elf takes better shots than some more expensive point  and shoot cameras in my collection.  I will eventually pass this on to my  daughter and buy a next generation Elf .but not in the immediate future..,5,1,518
AYGA7XTZIHCVY,9095,Great subwoofer when it works but fails with a steady. loud. annoying burst of 120 cycle thumps. Infinity is know for great speakers. I have an entire surround sound system built around them. I cannot understand why they would jeopardize theirname based upon a poor design which really stresses the components or a good design that uses marginal components.  Note! I am an electronics engineer.... You would think that they would send out an announcement about the problem and offer a work around or recall the unit and offer something new. Too bad. Based upon the reviews and the bad luck Ive have. it looks like I have to find something different.,1,0,649
AYGS5X37PR33N,44,Its a shame that some printer manufacturers dont provide USB cables to connect to computers. This cable was just the perfect one. even though it was a tad too short. But the quality is very good. Cables are thick and the joints are sturdy.,4,1,239

AYHKKQ89726HU,0,Ive had this MP3 player since probably year 2000 and it STILL works surprisingly. Four years and it still works! I had a few problems...when I upgraded my PC to Windows XP. The drivers didnt support it so I had to search around and finally found RealOne had the Rio500 support. Well it being year 2004...theres iPods and these MP3 players that hold 5000 songs while this holds maximum 20. Well back then it was cool.,4,1,416

AYIHV500HTXJF,13,I almost bought this remote. I am a strong follower of Microsoft products and I still have to speak poorly of this one. For the money. the Philips Pronto is a far better value. The Pronto will control any number of devices  where the Take Control can handle only 15. Also. the Take Control is all  text based that you scroll through. but the Pronto will let you design your  own remote with any number of screens. You can even import better looking  buttons. I highly recommend the Pronto.,1,0,489
AYJ7384IMC7B1,6165,My Palm Pilot just died one day ...  Nothing ...  Hello ...  So. it was time to get a new PDA.  I am a programmer and I have yet to meet anyone with a WinCE device.  So. I did a small amount of research and basically  bought my Nino blind.The Palm Pilot is simple.  That is its best  feature.  With Minimal brain usage. you are storing your phone numbers in  your Palm Pilot.The Nino is more complex.  It is Windows  in a smaller  form.  You also have to learn the metaphysics of the Windows CE device.  You have to use both hands.  You learn to manipulate the system in your  left hand through a series of button presses  four on each side of the  device.  It is not hard. and it takes a few days of using to get used to  it.At first. I tried to use it like a Palm Pilot and got frustrated.  I  was ready to send it back.  Then I sat down one day and read the manual.  u0026quotOh. if I press any two of these buttons. it does this.  Oh. if I  press this one. it does that  Cool!!!u0026quot.Yes. it is slower than a  Palm Pilot. but it is differnt.  I wish my Telephone was a WinCE phone  it  just makes sense.  In the future. you will have two types of PDA users1. Those with expensive phone books .Palm et al.2. Those with Windows  CE devicesMy only complaint is that the synchonization software that  comes with this model does not sync well in NT.  It took time to putz with  it to get it to work less than 50% of the time.  If you get one of these.  the first thing that you must do is go to microsoft.com and get a free copy  of ActiveSync 3.0 for CE devices.  It synchs up 100% of the time and is  great.  Im still learning how to use it. but I never got so much use from  my Palm Pilot.  I even have the voice recognition working and can make it  do things by taking to it!To me. the Palm Pilot is like a Mac.  Youre  stuck with simple stuff.  You do what it can do. and dont try anything  advanced.  This is good for most people. but Windows CE is Windows.  If you  are a Windows programmer. this is just the start of the future  get one  now!!!,4,1,2055

AYKXABHFBFGJX,0,This tv wall mount is an example of you get what you pay for.  It does the job and is sturdy when tightened down so the TV isnt going any where.  The problem is that the TV level is different when the wall mounts arm is extended or retracted.  If you level the TV with the arm retracted so the the TV is against the wall the TV will be slanted when you pull the arm out to full extension. and vise versa.  I ended up purchasing a Wall mount for twice the money but with non of the problems.,2,0,490
AYO4LW3HDG1Z7,22,Video tapes from Maxells product line are among the best consumer grade VHS tapes available to the public and the preferred choice among video archivers. When used in conjunction with a highend VCR. Maxell Gold provides an excellent picture. even when used in the extended play  super long play speed and is incredibly durable.

This is an excellent tape for a reasonable price and one of the best choices for archiving your most precious memories.,5,1,535
AYOKRAK8MOQXB,1515,Maybe its my choice of reading material. but Ive had a hard time finding the fairly new books or older ones  that Im looking to buy. Amazons inventory is much larger. I hope that someday the software allows more interchange between the two.Also  Im not crazy about having to carry something that doesnt have more than one purpose. I guess Im going to think about an IPad soon. For one thing. I have loved the Apple navigation systems for years  much more intuitive for a nontechie like me. I didnt find getting around in the Nook very simple at all.,3,0,549

AYTGG6XTVUG7G,0,I have used one of these sportbelt cases for my thriceweekly trips to the gym for several years now. and overall. I have been pleased.  The best feature of this case is that it is roomy. and includes generously sized extra pockets along the belt.  I have to carry keys. a small padlock. change. and extra batteries during my trips to my workout. in addition to the cd player. my Etymotic earphones. and an extra cd. so the roominess of these belt pockets is welcome.I have noticed complaints by other reviewers regarding poor stitching leading to breakage.  This surprises me. as I have had no such problems.  However. I think that people would be wise NOT to put the cd player itself in the outside compartment .as shown in the illustration.. as this area is contained only by light netting.  The stitching along this netting might well be more prone to breakage.  I always put the player in the innermost pocket. leaving the outside pocket for extra cds only.My only real complaint about this product is that over time. the belt itself tends to wrinkle badly. and there is no good way to flatten it out .since its nylon. its not a good idea to iron the thing..  This is not really a major problem. however.,4,1,1208
AYTNXLGUQYSTF,55,I just bought mine last night and without reading any book or instructions I was able to get started right away. I downloaded my first book and began searching the million or so books that are free for download. I was skeptical about buying a device for reading because I get headaches from computer screens after a while but there is no backlight at all and it actually looks like paper!Why I decided to go with this one is because we were able to go into a barnes and noble and play with it and see how we liked it. You can listen to music and add your own photos which is really cool also.It has a share feature that allows you to share your books with other nook users for 2 weeks which is nice as well.I am very excited and love it so far!It was only USD250 at the store not USD349,4,1,786

AZ0FIJCBTM6MI,22,As a selfemployed graphic artist. I bring my laptop with me even on vacations for the sake of work emergencies. Its a 17  MacBook Pro. so its not small enough for a hotel safe. and I hate leaving it out when I leave the room because I just dont want to tempt housekeeping in that way. Packing it back up to keep it hidden every time I go out has gotten too tiresome. though. so I finally looked around and purchased this security cable.Im so glad I did.This was a fine fit for my laptop model u00268212the slot for it is on the right. I wrapped the other end around a closed chair leg. so that if anyone decided to take the laptop. theyd have to take the chair with them too and call attention to themselves. Im aware that anyone really determined to take it still could. but my laptop being a fairly old model and the security cable being in place. its really not worth it to the casual snatcher. and thats enough for my peace of mind it allows me to leave the laptop out on the table. ready for me to log in and get right back to work without having to unpack again and boot up.,5,1,1080
AZ1EE5YKY0K8Y,0,This is the choice of speakers for someone who wants to hear 4 way gaming. If you want it for excellant music qulaity then forget it. The Subwoofer is useless if turned up to high. The volume control and stands are a welcome  bonus and if you have the Soundblaster Live or Monster MX300 then you will  have a GOOD PC solution. Gamers will be happy but for people who use their  PC for recording and music play back you will not get the best out of your  sound card with these. There are much better speaker out there  albeit for  more money. Still the volume control is good.,3,0,575
AZ1EE5YKY0K8Y,1919,I have had this card for over 6 months now and looking back wish I had nveer bought it. I am from the train of thought of measuring performace with the human eye. and functionality with ease of use and productivity. So  there are 2 elements to this card. The 3d and the TV. The 3d is the better  aspect to this card. excellant driver support but not noticeabily better  then the voodoo2 .or SLI.. This seems a very intermiedate card released  while knowing that there was better to come. The 32bit color is also a  myth. Your human eye wont notice the difference!  So the 3d is good  not  as mesmorising as the Voodoo2 first was. The TV  element has to be one of  the worst peices of hardwardsoftware I have ever seen .and I bought this  card for video edit  DOH!.. True 3dfx have to release a product that is  compatable on many different systems in many countries but Hauuppage have  managed it. The drivers for the TV are appalling. Update after update fixes  dont work  just check the website  and old problems come back etc. Sound  card compatability problems and viewing full screen problems . the list  goes on. its simply not worth the hassle  I can gaurantee some kind of  problem.  The software for capture simplly doesnt work  I have to use MGI  Videowave. The capture is NOT as good a 40 Hauppage card. and the  compression on MPEG1 is not as good. True you get real time compression but  the quality and file size is worse. And this is with a 72000RPM hard drive.  Anything slower dont evern bother.  I think Ill fork out 40 and buy my  old Hauppage card again as this is a steel for video capture and think  twice before buying a 3dfx card again. Be warned,2,0,1670
AZ1EE5YKY0K8Y,77,This camera is the 2nd best Hi8 camera from Sony. Its simplistic to use and has some cool features and effects. The picture quality and sterio sound are superb for play back on TV and PC. The 80x zoom is alsi very  powerful. The photostill facility is weak but thats to be expected on  Camcorders. However the brilliant nightshot and built in lamp make for a  good Blair Witch Project if you ever fancy that. I have used it for about 2  months now and havent really used needed to use the effects but the  picture quality and sound make this a top camera .I can hardly notice the  difference from my brothers digital camera.. Make sure you get another  battery as with the LCD on it lasts about 90 mins and uses good quality hi  8 tapes to get the best out of it. You wont be dissopointed.,5,1,789
AZ1H3VLCDR298,46,When I bought this player I thought what the heck. what couldgo wrong with it. besides the mechanical problems. it is an inferiormachine. the eject button is right next to the stop button. so if your fingers slip a touch. you have to close the tray again and find where you left off in the movie. therefore another awful problem. it wont remember where you left off at! the booklet came apart in two days. it was halfUSD!  attached by two staples. and if the machine is unplugged. you have to reprogam your remote for your television. because itll forget the code! it started screwing up on the matrix and I took it in to exchange it. since I bought the extended warrenty. needless to say it is heading off to the shop. and thank god for the nolemon policy! because I WILL keep sending it back till I get what I want.  when I was at the service desk. I saw a panasonic and a sony DVD player brought in around the same time. its too late for me. but my advice to those who want a dvd now. please wait. its a new technology and many things are wrong with it...if you must buy one. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER. the price may be attractive. but it is garbage. stick to the two best names. JVC and sony. i regret for not waiting longer and making a more intellegent decision. RESEARCH!  dont get information from the sales people. read magazines and go to independent websites for the best player..i told them to test a bugs life on it to see if it would mess up!.,1,0,1458

AZ52LG63GEJEK,13,I love having an electronic book reader. but the Nook Color is a big disappointment.  It has so many really irritating quirks and problems.  Ive never used any other brand. so I cant compare. but I definitely dont recommend getting a Nook Color.The biggest problem is that the battery life is abysmal.  After just a couple months use. I now only get about 2 hours of use on a full charge. even with the screen dimmed quite a bit.  Since I want to use this when Im traveling and dont usually have access to an outlet. this is a HUGE problem and extremely limits its usefulness.Besides that.* It has a tendency to turn itself on.  This happens whenever I put in or remove the power plug and sometimes just when it gets jostled.  Sometimes I dont notice because the cover is closed. Turning itself on after I remove the power plug definitely doesnt help with the already abysmal battery power.* When Im using it while it is plugged in and charging. which is most of the time because of the poor battery. it repeatedly displays the battery charging message. ever 1020 seconds for a second or so.  This is VERY disruptive when trying to read. forcing me to pause and wait until it disappears.*  While reading. the menu at the bottom pops up A LOT too. for no apparent reason. covering the lower text.* Sometimes books get stuck on one page and wont advance or will skip pages.  It takes quite a bit of finagling to get it to show the missing pages.* There are a few spots on the screen that dont respond to touch. especially near the upper and right edges. which is where webpages usually have critical navigation buttons.* The zoom feature is very hard to use. and the zoom level doesnt stay the same  when moving from page to page. especially on websites. I try to zoom the webpages so I can access buttons under the dead touchscreen spots. but the page wont stay zoomed in when trying to move the page to get to the desired spot.* The touchscreen doesnt work well on webpages. often selecting a different item than the one touched.  This often sends me zinging off to undesired links.* The onscreen keypad doesnt always pop up when trying to type something on a webpage. and theres no way to manually make it show.* The Nooks book filing system is rudimentary and hard to sort.  I would especially like to be able to sort by rating. but it doesnt allow that.  Id also like to be able to tag books. but cant do that either.* The Bu0026N online store search is terrible.  You cant do a dual search to narrow down long lists. and it will only list the books alphabetically by title.  On the tiny Nook screen. it takes forever to scroll through long results.  You cant exclude tags.  When I search for mysteries. theres all this paranormal stuff mixed in that Id like to exclude but cant.* I cant look through my own reviews on the Barnes and Noble website using the Nook Color.  It doesnt support that feature.  I can only access them on my regular laptop.  Dunh.  I read a lot of books and cant keep track of all of them.  It would be handy when Im thinking about buying a book by an author Ive read before to be able to see what I thought of the authors other book.* Some Google apps and Flash Player apps dont work on the Nook.  I subscribe to NFL Game Rewind. something I enjoy when Im on the road. but I cant watch it on my Nook Color.One thing I do like is that there are a lot of really good. free books for the Nook Color available through the Bu0026N online store.And I like that I can watch Netflix.,2,0,3504
AZ62TAW1ZT1US,0,I origionally wanted the Diamond Rio 500 because it looked SO cool. but  when I found out that it had 64 mb of memory .over 90 minutes playtime.  instead of the standard 32. not to mention you can upgrade it to 96 MB.  which is like. the BEST on the market. I was SO sold! It hasnt arrived  yet. but by the time this is posted. it will have. Ill write another  review then. But anyway. If a stylin stereo with a Mega Memory is what you  are looking for..... THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT!! C Ya All L8R! Tune in 4 my  next review next week!  A happy Customer!,5,1,551

AZ7L9XSY5DWU1,0,Purchased 2 of these.  Had for approximately a month.  Tried to use for sound hound and appeared it was working but kept indicating could not here sound so I increased the volume on the amplifier. it never captured the music.Since I was not sure how it worked. I assumed I was doing something wrong.  Finally. had a friend try and he said the mic did not appear to be working.However. I must say that I received it in a couple of days so shipping was fast.,1,0,456
AZ7UYZLF6652D,0,Truly a fantastic item. To have every edition. cover to cover. right on your desktop. laptop or mobile device is such a space saver. This is a perfect item for anyone with a historical interest as well. It is fascinating seeing the gradual yet noticeable changes throughout the years. as well as the advertisements which certainly hallmark the age of each issue. A must have for any connoisseur that is breaking through to the 21st century!!!,5,1,442
AZ8CDNI095DI4,13,After recording an MD. I entered the track information with the nice Jog Dial of the 722.  When finished. I hit stop so the TOC would write to the  MD. but got an error.  The MD would not work within the 722 any more.  When  I tried it in a different MD player. it worked fine. but the 722 just  showed a TOC error.I have no idea how good the product is in general.  but it gets only one star for how it worked for me.  The one star is  because it didnt destroy the MD beyond use on another player. but the 722  sure couldnt handle the disc any more.,1,0,550
AZ8MA4VZ2C3PL,417,Item is used and functions like the VCR it replaced.There was a minor problem with the unit which Mr Hardy resolved very quickly.I would recommend any product sold by Grapevine Video to a friend,4,1,194
AZ9B0TV9I29EZ,0,This camera is compact and versitile. however. I have missed alot of moments by getting more then half of my pictures smeared OR blurred.  I just open the shutters. point and shoot!  Some times it takes the picture  right away and sometimes it takes a second or two before it reacts.  By  then. the picture has already changed!  Ive missed alot of precious  moments of my birthing. my infant and my family due to the quality of this  camera and delay of the shots!  I dread using my camera because of my bad  experience and dissapointment in the quality after developing my pictures  .which are expensive and not worth it in the end.!  I wish I could say  better things about this camera. but Im definately convinced that this  camera is a LEMON!,2,0,746
AZAGDOKVTKN5B,1920,I like the handheld u0026quotPCsu0026quot... but not this one.  They are terrific for certain functions... basic word processing. email... carrying contacts out on the road... but the HP 680 just doesnt hold up.  The  hinges broke after only a month of use on the road.  HP would not cover the  repair under warrenty... because u0026quotpry marks voided the  warrentyu0026quot....  OK. but try to change the battery without leaving pry  marks.  Ive since moved to the NEC MobilePro 780... Its much better  constructed. holding up to wearandtear much more robustly.  Its also  lighter and gets better battery life... a much better alternative to the  Jornada.,1,0,658
AZANOSUQAY5C6,3438,I had the original adapter that came with my Nook Color for 2 years without any problems. After 2 years it finally broke. and I didnt even know people were having troubles with their chargers until I had to buy a new one. I have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again I dont seem to be having any problems with it.The original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though. which is where everyone is having problems. So I will not deny that this seems to be an issue. For that it loses a star. but because I personally havent had any major problems with them I will still give it 4 stars.,4,1,652

AZCAJPDN9WUSG,33,I just bought one of these cards for my parents so I could upgrade their computer. I knew ATI cards where the primary video decive that the Windows Operating Systems were made on so I figured they would be the most compatible. HAH! I guesed wrong! After installing everything on the u0026quoteasy installation CDu0026quot I restarted and then saw that the drivers hadent even been installed! I looked for the drivers on the CD. None. They reccomended on their website that you dont use the CD and download drivers from their achive. After being lost in the achive I finnaly found the drivers. Installed them and it worked. I tryed Quake III Arena on their 600mhz PIII  and it was slower than HECK! I tore it out and returned it immediatly! My parents now have an outstanding TnT 2 Ultra made by the great nVidia. DO Not buy this card.,2,0,834
AZFC7SEDZM5UH,37,There are cables. and then there are cables!  If youre looking for a dependable way to extend the length of comcable between your high speed modem and your PC. this is an excellent choice.  Belkin designed this Cat 5e baby for high speed transmission and equipped it with the proper RJ45. gold plated connectors at each end.  Its a snap to hook up.  All you have to be careful of is that you dont puncture or pinch the cable if you elect to secure it to a wall.  There are plenty of proper cable fasteners for this that should be available at your local hardware store.,5,1,569
AZFX0704GBCF7,45,The reviews are basically righton for this TV.  The picture is excellent. inputoutput jacks are adequate. and the sound from the builtin speakers  is quite good. free of unwanted resonances.  The picture you get with a  digital satellite system is as good as it gets.  If youve never owned a 36  inch directview TV before. be forewarned that these things are beasts.  weighing in at over 150 lbs.  Youll need a stand thats 18u0026quot deep and  at least 30u0026quot wide.  If youre taking this home from the store. figure  on needing a refridgerator dolly as the box is huge and a close fit for  your front door.  Make no mistake about it moving this thing is a two man  job!  If you buy from Amazon as I did. the shipper will carry it into the  house. unpack it. and haul away the packing materials.  The color.  contrast. etc. were perfect right out of the box. with no adjustments  necessary.  Contrary to the opinion of some. I found the remote control  operation quite logical and easy to use.  HOWEVER. Note that the remote  control is not capable of controlling todays digital satellite receivers!  While it was simple to set it up to control my RCA VCR. theres simply no  way to control an RCA satellite receiver.  A very strange omission. but  perhaps understandable considering this model must have been around for a  couple of years already.  Oddly. the instruction manual shows you how to  hook up a satellite receiver and VCR. among several configurations of such  equipment.  Back on the positive side of things. Amazon gets high marks for  the free shipping and getting it into my hands within the promised  timeframe.  Their shipping partner communicates well with customers and  gets an A+ from me. One other piece of advice. if youre considering a flat  screen TV in the 3236 inch range.such as Sony. make sure you take a good  look at the reflections you see in their screen and then take a look at the  Toshiba.  The slightly rounded Toshiba screen makes for less noticeable  reflections important unless you always view the TV in a completely dark  room.,4,1,2075
AZG95RUTCCDIW,1415,The picture quality is better than my JVC 4 head Hi Fi VCR.The stereo dbx sound is flawless. The remote works quicker than any Ihave ever used. It records stereo movies from Showtime and HBO to tapes that equal factory videos. Still pictures are completely noiseless. as in search and reveiw. The only complaint I have is that the so called lighted remote is not really lighted. I own eight VCRs and this is the least expensive one I have purchased. And yet it is just about the best.,5,1,484
AZGZXR9ZHOPWT,4244,This is a fairly nice radio for my bathroom. which has very little space and no wall outlet. It would be nice. though. if the radio had the option of plugging it in when it isnt used in a shower. The little wire antenna also is not getting good reception. When I can get the suction cup to stick to the window. its pretty good. but it wont stay put for long. Even with the wire fully extended to an upper shelf. the radio station cuts in and out as I move around in the shower. which is across the room. Im sure Ill appreciate it more the next time we have a big storm and power outage. All in all. its rather expensive for a lessthanperfect radio.,3,0,648
AZHIAUVXLLHUK,0,Very convenient. portable radio.  Seems to get good reception with an external antenna.  Only problem I have is with using a magnetic mounted antenna. Since this radio does not mount directly to the vehicle. it is not grounded well. So with using a magnetic mounted antenna. this pairing still does not create a good ground. which is why I cant seem to get a good SWR reading.  I have been told by a radio specialist that I may need to wrap some wire around the coupling that connects radio to the external antenna. and then mount the other end of the wire to the vehicle somewhere.  As long as it is metal... I am considering getting a hood channel mount and antenna instead.  That is when I figure out how to shove the coax cable through the firewall on my 04 Avalanche..,4,1,773

AZI2LSICN77KW,22,As my modem sits right on top of my computer. a three foot cable was the best length for my needs so as to minimize cable clutter behind the computer. Connectors fit fine with reliable connections. Have cycled connectors numerous times in order to break the computer connection on web sites which cause browser to freeze so these can apparently handle cycling without reliability problems. This was important as Ive had the plastic latch fail on other CAT5 cables from plugging  unplugging.,5,1,490

AZICZ21T0UQT,0,I bought the keyboard. and had to buy the headphones and the power supply separatly!  Some musice stores bundle the headphones. power supply and sustain pedal together as a separate package to sell with the keyboard.  These headphones come with a mini plug and a compatible plug adapter for the keyboard jack.  Without the adapter. the headphones can be used with M3P and compact disc players.  The real necessary piece is the adapter. because these low budget headphones are as good as any that can be bought in a dollar discount store.,3,0,537

AZKMU1V42WUTP,0,I bought this with a chest harness for use on my motorcycle. I modified it for  push to talk  and its a reasonably priced way to communicate with my fellow riders who have pricey builtin CBs on their bikes. The addition of a permanent mount CB system to my bike was going to be a very expensive project. This was a reasonable solution to the cost situation. This unit required the addition of an external antenna for the best results.,5,1,434

AZMCJ61JS6L3X,14,I originally bought a Panasonic AU115 DVD player. It would occasionally freeze up on certain scenes while playing a movie.I exchanged it for a different one.same model.Same problem.with the addition of skipping while  playing a CD.I returned  it and got my money back.Later.I bought a  Panasonic AU120 DVD player.Guess what? Yup.same problem!I returned that  one.too.I might try a  different brand later.Im concerned that this  freezing problem may not be confined only to  Panasonic DVD players.Ive  heard that it happens to all brands of DVD players.and if this is true. Im  going to stay with VHS until they fix the problem with this format.At least  movies on VHS do not lock up.and they.in many cases.cost only about  2550%  of what movies on DVD cost.And you dont have to sit through the stupid  anti copy warnings.either!!!That is soo irritating!!!,1,0,855

AZPPZOYTNLEN0,23,We bought this unit for a Directv DVR.  It took a lot of tweeking to get it to work in the first place.  And now a few months later. still plugged in to the same spot we had it. it stopped working.  If you plug the unit in side by side with the base unit it works.  If you move it 8 feet. it doesnt work.  It has actually been a pain.  I feel its been a huge waste of time and money.,1,0,383

AZRLXMFNW66I3,0,Ive had my YachtBoy 400 for about a week now. and I love it!  .the 400 is identical to the 400PE. but the newer PE comes with an AC adaptor..Within minutes of putting the batteries in the unit I was listening to stations from all over the world.  To maximize your listening. especially as a newer listener. buy a good guide like Passport to Worldband Radio.I have read all the reviews. and I believe the tone quality is better than the naysayers lead you to believe.  The tuning is very simple. and once you try all the functions. the operations are intuitive.I considered the Sony and the ATS909 among others.  I read hundreds of reviews. and I was convinced that the biggest weakness of the Yacht Boy is SSB reception.  I have been satisfied with that feature on mine. and since it works ok for me. Im not sure what the grumbling is all about.If I had it to do all over again. which radio would I buy?  This one.  Im perfectly satisfied with it.By the way. if you have questions or ever need help. I have found that the Eton .Grundig U.S. customer service and technical folks are extremely helpful.,5,1,1100

AZXV189RY6AOU,0,Buy an Allinwonder from ATI. buy a video card from ATI. maybe even buy a used car from these people.  But I cant recommend buying their addon TV tuner cards.  Long story shortI spent 2 hours on my own trying to install this beast.  I spent almost 4 hours on the phone to Toronto with a very knowledgable. helpful and pleasant ATI technician.  After trying everything he knew. he was going to Overnite a new card to me.  Later that night. the Tuner card application crashed.  Then the install disk crashed.  I decided to save up for a Radeon AllinWonder.  ATI technician was honest with me.  He told me he wished the company wouldnt sell this card.  1.Never got the audio portion of this card to work.  2.The quality of the video is rather jerky and full of digital artifact.  3.The closed captioning garbled the words pretty badly. Oh by the way. I am running an ATI Rage Fury in my wintel machine that has never been buggy or had problems other than those induced by Win98 updates that were fixed by downloading drivers from ATIs excellent website.,1,0,1049

AZZGUU97OHUF1,0,I bought this unit because the Sony unit was not in stock. other reviews indicated that it was slightly smaler than a standard shoebox recorder which for me is good. I always use batteries so the wallwart style AC adaptor was not an issue for me.Unfortunatly the unit has issues.First the unit uses AA batteries instead of C cells.  This makes it  smaller. but C cells last a LOT longer than AAs.  Also the internal mic is awfull. lots of tape noise. All recorders will have some tape noise but this is really bad.  I never had that problem with my trusty old Radio Shack Model.In order to get any utility out of this I will have to pick up an external mic. which brings the total up past USD30.  If I had wanted to spend that much I could have just gone to Radio Shack.,2,0,770
